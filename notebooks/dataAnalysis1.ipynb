I would be really grateful for some advice.\\n\\nI graduated from a prestigious university with a bachelors in CS last spring, and have been working and making a really comfortable salary in a big tech company (return offer on a summer 2021 internship). I had worked with an assistant professor on ML research for the last two years and had a good and productive time; the professor really believed in me, and towards the last semester, suggested that I apply for PhD programs in that area.\\n\\nI did not believe that I could get into any PhD programs this cycle, as this particular subfield is extremely competitive, and so figured that I would not seriously decide whether or not to do a PhD unless I get in. I only targeted very competitive places and applied to my undergrad's fully-funded, research-focused MS program (most likely I'd be working with the same advisor again) as a backup.\\n\\nAll my results came in, and I have gotten into a number of very good PhD programs, as well as the MSCS backup. Among my PhD offers, one is from a non-top 4 CS school which ranks among the top 3 of my subfield, and the advisor that I got is very, very good. The prospective PhD advisor is extremely well-connected and super nice, and my undergraduate advisor was previously affiliated with their group and could not have anything more positive to say.\\n\\nAmong the academic folks whom I've spoken to, the overwhelming consensus is that I should just go to the state school and work with that professor. And I feel like if I were to pursue a PhD, I would definitely take up the offer. But I've been getting very cold feet about the whole business of doing a PhD; my undergrad experience was very stressful and I just could not imagine 6 more years of lowish pay (that particular school gives the lowest stipend, despite being located in a fairly expensive city). I have zero interest in becoming a professor and would ideally like to be in research-oriented roles in the industry, and that's why I'm seriously considering the MSCS backup. At this point, I'm pretty set on going back to school, given the turbulence and ongoing layoffs in the tech industry.\\n\\nHere are some direct concerns about going into the PhD:\\n\\n1. Earning a livable wage and having savings are definitely very important to me and I can't justify walking away from an six-figure annual salary and living for 5-6 years on a $30K-ish PhD stipend. Comparatively, the MSCS stipend is on the higher end (\\\\~$50K) with a good exit opportunity to industry after 2 years.\\n2. I love parts of the research process, but I won't deny that it was highly stressful and I came out of undergrad feeling extremely burnt out, with horrible work-life balance and a lot of unprocessed emotional issues. My quality of life has greatly improved since getting into a normal 9-5, but I just can't imagine 6 more years of going through that again.\\n3. Maybe the one slightly negative thing (and it's not a big issue) is that the PhD advisor is pretty hands-off given that they already have tenure and are affiliated with some industry connections. I am definitely not a very skilled researcher and would need a lot of hands-on guidance, especially in the first few years. The group is very nice, with senior students, but for the most part it seems decentralized (some people are remote / WFH), so I worry that I wouldn't be getting enough mentorship.\\n4. Not a huge factor, but something I'd have to mentally come to terms with: the PhD program itself has incredible prestige within the subarea, but the school's lay prestige is much lower than my undergrad's.\\n\\nThe primary reason for moving forward with the PhD is that this is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; this advisor is the dream advisor for many other applicants and I feel that I would not get as good of an offer again were I to decide later on in life to pursue a PhD. I am also feeling extremely pressured by a lot of people in academia to just go do the PhD and not even consider the MSCS (not a good feeling).\""

    "If the subreddit's top error was MORFOLOGIK_RULE_EN_US before, it turned into COMMA_COMPOUND_SENTENCE for the majority of the subreddits. If it was COMMA_COMPOUND_SENTENCE, then it became MORFOLOGIK_RULE_EN_US. The other cases were the whitespace rule, and I lowercase. Whitespace rule relates to how much whitespace is in between words, sentences, etc. I lower case relates to putting a lowercase i instead of an uppercase one."

Other top 15 errors, that may not occur in other subreddits, will be interesting to explore."
