0,A Beginner's Guide to Broadway,yb7hdd,"**Introduction**

I’ve had the idea of writing this for a while. It’s a pretty long post, and I hope it’s okay to put on this sub. Can’t think of where else it would go! I know a lot of readers already know much of what's in here. But my heart warms every time I see a post from a first-time tourist posting Playbills. I figured with the spring season heating up and holidays around the corner, now is a perfect time to put pen to paper.

Whether you’re looking to choose a show, save money, or just understand what makes a show on or off Broadway, I made this guide for you. Throughout this post, I reference many specific shows that are playing on Broadway *as of this writing in October 2022*. This means that there is no guarantee that when you are reading this, all of the shows named are still playing. When deciding on what to see, make sure you’re looking at the most up-to-date list of what’s [currently playing on Broadway](https://www.broadway.org/shows/index/currently_playing,-1).

**What Is a Broadway Show?**

So let’s get started. “Broadway” is often used interchangeably with “theater,” “musical theater” or “midtown Manhattan.” But for the purposes of this post, I’m using a somewhat technical definition of “Broadway.” There around 6,000 theaters in the U.S. Only 41 of them are in midtown Manhattan and seat at least 500 people. These theaters constitute the Broadway theaters. [They’re all roughly along the street called Broadway](https://www.vividseats.com/blog/broadway-101-theaters-current-shows-and-seating-guides) in Manhattan. Confusingly, one of the theaters is named the “[Broadway Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_Theatre_(53rd_Street)).” I feel for the tourists on that one. If a play is performed in one of these theaters, it earns the title of “Broadway show.” If the play is a musical, it becomes a “Broadway musical.”

It is therefore impossible to see a Broadway show live without actually traveling to New York City. However, many shows that have been on Broadway—or are perhaps on their way there—travel to theaters around the country, too. Sometimes they’re in gigantic theaters that hire Equity performers (i.e., members of the Actors’ Equity Association), and potentially musicians, directors, stage managers, ushers, and so on, who are part of their respective unions, too. These shows are every bit as entertaining and chock full of talent as the Broadway versions. But for better or worse, the most prestigious theater credit that one can currently have in the U.S. is on a Broadway stage.

Personally, I am hugely partial to musicals. A work of musical theater can have it ALL. It has not just music and acting, but also—depending on the show—dance, costumes, elaborate sets, lighting, sound effects, puppetry, story, poetry, and essentially any art form you can imagine. For any readers with a classical background, there’s an [argument to be made](https://broomearts.org/opera-musicals-four-letter-words-sondheim-explains-glimmerglass/) that the only difference between musical theater and opera is audience expectations. Yet Broadway also includes many nonmusical plays, which are often more economical to put on; producers no longer have to worry about arranging or orchestrating scores, mixing voices with instruments, hiring musicians and music directors, or paying composers and lyricists.

**Buying a Ticket**

Seeing a show on Broadway is not typically cheap, though there are ways to make it affordable and even some ways to make it nearly free. Anecdotally, because I live in the city and can be very flexible with dates (in addition to being obsessed with this stuff and having generous and theater-obsessed friends) I usually see every single Broadway musical at least once and rarely pay more than $50 per ticket. However, if you go to a show’s website and look to buy a ticket for retail price, a typical ticket costs between $100–$200, with premium seats costing a bit more, and premium seats *to premium shows* (usually speaking, a show with celebrities in the cast) costing a lot more. Since the pandemic, it is rare for a show to sell out very far in advance, but when it happens, tickets on the secondary market can go into the thousands.

The *complete* breakdown for how to save on Broadway tickets could be a lengthy post in and of itself and depends on the show. There are some common tricks that are worth being aware of, especially if you’re looking to make it as affordable as possible or cram in multiple shows across a few days.

* Be wary of ticket resellers. The first results that show up on Google when you search for a show are not always the most economical. There are plenty of sites that will sell you tickets with a steep premium. Notably, [Broadway.com](https://www.broadway.com/) is a ticket reseller site and not “official.” The simplest way to save some money is to buy tickets in person. If you buy a ticket directly from the theater’s box office, you will pay no additional taxes and fees. An $89 ticket, for example, will cost exactly $89, not $89 + $8.12 tax + $5.00 online fee + $12.50 service fee + $4.20 go-screw-yourself fee. Broadway box offices generally do not have publicly listed numbers you can call, so this has to be done in person.
* Located in Lincoln Center and Times Square, there are physical [TKTS booths](https://www.tdf.org/nyc/7/TKTS) where you can stand in line and buy tickets at approximately half price, so $50–$100 per ticket. These are only for same-day or next-day shows, and high-demand shows are not guaranteed to be available.
* Every show has its own set of rush and lottery options. Some shows do not offer either, but most do, and every show is a little bit different. [Another Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/xou3hq/broadwayforbrokepeoplecom/) has created the unbelievably slick website [bwayrush.com](https://bwayrush.com/), which is probably the current best roundup for these deals, with [broadwayonabudget.com](https://broadwayonabudget.com/) in a close second. *In general*, for rush, you buy tickets early in the morning for a show later that day. *In general*, for lotteries, you have the option to enter for 1 or 2 tickets for a show the next day. When you win, you typically get a few hours to decide whether you want to purchase the tickets before they are released. Only then will you be charged and find out what seats you got. Lottery and rush tickets are usually in the $40–$50 range per ticket, though some are as cheap as $10 (Hamilton) and some approach $60 (The Piano Lesson and Wicked).

The methods above only scratch the surface. Similar to how with enough research, you can save deep on travel fare or new appliances, there is a rabbit hole of savings tactics: some shows have Standing Room Only seats; some theaters have promotions for students, military, young audience members, specific performances, and so on; some theaters partner with papering services such as [Will Call Club](https://willcallclub.com/) to give away tickets; many shows have [discount codes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/wk4j7j/discount_megathread/) for their primary online ticket seller; the [TodayTix app](https://www.todaytix.com/) occasionally has promotions with very cheap tickets; and many people are eligible to become [TDF](https://www.tdf.org/) members, which provides access to discounted tickets.

**Choosing a Show**

Broadway theatergoers come from around the world, and for all sorts of reasons. For a theater diehard, Broadway can feel like a mecca. Readers in this category don’t need my advice on what to see; they likely know many (if not all) of the shows currently on Broadway and already have ideas of which ones they want to see. But plenty of audience members rarely see plays or musicals outside of a trip to NYC and consider Broadway a major tourist attraction—which, to be fair, it is—instead of a theater mecca. 

As of this writing, the shows that are likely easiest to follow for non-English speakers are *The Lion King*, *Aladdin*, and *The Phantom of the Opera*. Notably, *KPOP* is also playing, which includes both Korean and English. If bringing children, check the show’s webpage for recommended ages. Many shows include sensitive and/or adult content, and unlike a movie theater, if your child cries, screams, or wants to leave, you will disrupt the actual performers in the show. (These performers are the best of the best though; they will completely ignore you. Er... usually.)

If you’re trying to decide what show(s) to see, my best recommendation honestly is to post here on Reddit. Describe yourself, who will be with you, what shows you’ve seen and liked (if any), what shows you hated (if any), and what you want in a show. Although I’m of the mindset that you can’t go wrong with a Broadway musical, the reality is everything is not for everyone. If you are looking for an upbeat, silly comedy, you will be disappointed—if not shocked—by *A Strange Loop*. Most shows run about two and a half hours including a 15-minute intermission, but check the individual shows you want to see in advance. *Six*, for example, is only around 90 minutes with no intermission.

Regarding where to sit, this too is hard to describe in generalities as every theater has its own quirks. Some theaters like Circle in the Square are designed so that all seats are close to the stage and there aren’t really any “bad” seats. Some theaters like the Lyceum Theatre include two balcony levels (the first one being the “mezzanine” and the second one being the “balcony”), with rear balcony seats being among the worst on Broadway. The best seats in almost every theater are Orchestra Center, roughly rows 5–10. Front row seats can be a blast to sit in. You will see the actors’ spit! You will catch how they did that costume change! But they also usually obscure some of the stage. Additionally, some stages such as the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre are so high up that a front row seat is downright painful for your neck, especially if you’re short. When choosing seats, I recommend using the website [A View from My Seat](https://aviewfrommyseat.com/) to preview what your specific view would be.

**Attending a Show**

Because Broadway is open to anyone who wants to see the show, there is no dress code. If you are wearing a shirt, pants, and shoes, and don’t smell bad, you’re fine! There is, however, etiquette that may be important to learn about if it is your first time in a theater or your first time in a U.S. theater. The expectation is that you and everyone with you will be quiet and respectful throughout the performance. The exception is at the end of most songs, when audience members clap to show appreciation. Brief shouts and screams of encouragement during loud applause is fine. So is a standing ovation at the end of the show or after a particularly virtuosic number. When in doubt, just follow what everyone else is doing.

You will not be allowed to take photos or videos during the show, and it is considered bad etiquette to sing along, stand up and dance, talk to the performers, or talk to your neighbors—even at a whisper. From all accounts, this is a problem that has been getting worse over the past few years. Ushers do try to fix problems and occasionally kick people out, but rude audience members are not always noticed or stopped. I have found that part of the Broadway experience is exercising a little bit of grace.

Some shows have stretched the boundaries of theater norms, too. For instance, at *KPOP*, ushers encourage you to cheer on the performers as though you were at a concert. Although it’s no longer playing on Broadway, *Tina* ended with a few “encore” songs where the audience was encouraged to stand up, dance, and take photos.

You will generally pass through a metal detector to enter the theater, and your bag may be searched. I’ve never had an issue if there was food or drink in my bag. I’ve even had a laptop and metal water bottle with no problems. After all, many people are going to the show after traveling around the city all day! Most (all?) theaters sell drinks and snacks like cookies and candy. They won’t be cheap. A strong drink in a souvenir plastic cup will cost over $30. Open wrappers before the show and at intermission, and avoid loud, crunchy snacks like chips while the show is happening.

**Can I Sing Along?**

No.

**But I Know All the Words and Am a Great Singer!**

People pay hundreds of dollars to see these shows and hear these singers, and they aren’t paying a goddamn dime to hear you.

**Outside of Broadway**

Although I won’t get into the specifics of what constitutes Off-Broadway, Off-Off-Broadway, and Non-Broadway (lord nor can I keep track of it all), there are *hundreds* of other theaters and performance venues across New York City that aren’t Broadway theaters. Simply by virtue of them being in NYC, more often than not, the creators, crew, and performers are well above average. If you’re looking for experimental theater, non-English theater, newly-written shows, ancient plays, improvisation, avant-garde, dance, performance art, stand-up comedy, *whatever you can imagine in a theater*, you’ve come to the right city. 

Leave Broadway, and tickets get cheaper too. It is easy to find retail theater tickets for under $50 outside Broadway. Moreover, these shows can still include big-name cast members and Equity cast and crew. Some notable shows playing Off-Broadway right now are *Kinky Boots*, *Little Shop of Horrors*, *Stomp*, and—soon—*Merrily We Roll Along* starring Daniel Radcliffe and Jonathan Groff. (Though good luck finding seats to that one at all, let alone under $50.)

**Curtain’s Up**

Let me finish with what I believe is the most important question: *what to do for dinner?* (Or, if seeing a matinee, lunch.) A show that plays between, say, 7–9:30 pm means you’re stuck deciding between an early—and quick—dinner before or a late dinner after. There is of course no universal answer for what to do, as people eat during different times, like different foods, and have different budgets. For the pre-show quick fix, Midtown Manhattan includes a ton of fast food options. Los Tacos No. 1 is commonly recommended, and personally I frequent Chipotle, Chick-fil-A, nearby delis and pizza places, and sometimes nearby bars to satisfy this need. For post-show meals, I strongly recommend walking west along 46th Street to 9th Avenue and exploring Hell’s Kitchen. Times Square has a few diamonds in the rough, but Hell’s Kitchen is *known* for an extensive selection of restaurants, bodegas, and bars that span ethnicities and prices.

1,Parade or Moulin Rouge?,11vvndh,"I’m going back to NYC during my university’s spring break in a few days. For anyone who’s gonna suggest Sweeney Todd, I’m planning on going during the summer since it’s an open run. I was thinking on seeing Parade because I heard great things about it. However, I have seem clips online of Aaron Tveit singing in Moulin Rouge and WOW. I know he’s only going to be there until April as well, so this is my only chance to see him. I’m conflicted because I feel I would prefer Parade as a show more than Moulin Rogue, but I still have the opportunity to see it before it closes when I come back over the summer while Aaron Tveit will be gone by then.

2,Suggestions for a 10 year old? Is Sweeney Todd a crazy plan?,11vgk58,"We are a family of 3 from Australia and will be in NYC in December this year, and I am starting to look at what our options are. I've already promised to take her to the Cursed Child, so that is sorted but we are also wanting to see a musical. She has seen Hamilton and Back to the Future and will probably see Wicked this year as well. We would like to prioritise shows that are unlikely to make it to Australia (we usually get very popular often very tame productions - think the Sound of Music and Disney). 

Sweeney Todd is most appealing to me but I have only seen the movie. We don't really worry about language (the stereotypes of Australians swearing is pretty accurate), and she is a reasonably mature kid. Am I crazy for considering Sweenrey Todd and/or can someone give some suggestions that would make all of us happy?",Thebronwyn,25,14,0.82
3,Lion King vs Wicked for a first time Broadway watcher?,11vr2dy,"I’m getting my fiancée tickets to Broadway for his bday. 

He’s never seen any shows live and isn’t generally into musicals but I know is down to seeing a show live for the experience. Knowing he wouldn’t spend the money himself, I figured it’d be a good intro to Broadway to get us tickets as part of his present!

I’m currently stuck between Lion King and Wicked as the fox to get. I’ve seen Wicked once (over 10+ years ago so I’d love to see it again) and I’ve never seen Lion King but have heard great things.

I’m going to NY May 19-21st, I already have Sweeney tickets for the 19th and I want to see Parade and Camelot along with one other show I haven’t decided on. I bought Camelot tickets for the 21st Sunday matinee, since it’s 3 hours, doing it in a two show day seems unideal but I bought it with the warranty of being able to cancel with a full refund. I then go to check Parade tickets and see that Ben Platt is out May 19-20th. Do I see the show without him? Do I get a refund on Camelot, move that to the second show on Saturday and see Parade Sunday? My concern also is that Parade is a depressing note to end my trip on.

7,"Thoughts on Some Like it Hot, Dancin’, Shucked, and Sweeney Todd",11v9kq5,"Hey! I just saw these four shows and wanted to share my experience/reviews for those deciding. (If you’re not a fan of reviews scroll past plz)

Some Like it Hot: Way better than expected. Great dancing, choreo and ensemble work. Each individual in the cast is very talented. I saw the swing for Sugar instead of Adrianna Hicks but she was lovely and very talented. Christian Borle (the reason I came to see it) was mostly great but didn’t really try to change his voice when he was playing Josephine (maybe not to damage his voice?). J. Harrison Ghee stole the show and is one of the most talented individuals I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. Ghee had such a powerful performance that brought me to tears with both comedic and dramatic excellence. Natasha Yvette Williams was beyond hilarious. The show overall handles themes of race and gender with respect and deviates from the movie greatly to add insightful commentary. 

Dancin’- (context: I was a dancer for 12 years and my sister dances over 40 hours a week) I was not very impressed with the show. Of course I don’t blame the dancers as I can tell they are talented but more direction was needed to ensure timing and consistency. Also leg extensions, tilts, arabesques we’re not very impressive from some cast members. Peter John Chursin was one of the few dancers I found to be exceptional. 

Shucked- It was cute! It was pretty much what I expected it, Grey Henson is always fun to watch. Great singers and ensemble work. Fun choreography and use of props during one of the later numbers. You’re not missing too much if you don’t see it but it’s a fun watch with a talented cast.

Sweeney Todd- Insanely good cast, unsurprisingly. Josh Groban’s voice filled the theatre wonderfully. I was initially worried about his acting from what I had read but for the most part I was pleasantly surprised. Annaleigh Ashford was hilarious. I’m a huge Sweeney Todd fan but never found it that funny, yet she made the show so much funnier. She has great physicality and acting choices. Jordan Fisher has the most beautiful voice for Johanna and had a great accent for the role. Maria Bilbao has one of the most technically pristine voices I have ever heard. Her mixed voice and transition between registers was beyond lovely. She sounded great with Jordan Fisher. Gaten Matarazzo was great and “Not While I’m Around” was probably my favorite song of the night. Great acting and vocal quality, he’s just enjoyable to watch. Gaten and Jordan were so sweet and kind at stagedoor.",InnerTone5925,0,26,0.91
8,Advice for shows in late May?,11vprgp,"My boyfriend and I will be visiting New York in late May (arrive May 30, leave June 2) and my priority is seeing some great theater. By my reckoning, we have four shows we can see: Tues night, Wed matinee, Wed night, and Thurs night.

We already have tickets for Sweeney Todd (Wed night) and Camelot (Th night). We love Sweeney, so that was a must, and neither of us have seen a staging of Camelot and we both love the music. But I'd love your advice on our last two options.

We're from Los Angeles, so lots of stuff tours here. I'd call us pretty adventurous in our theatergoing. We're less interested in the bigger long-lasting shows because we've been lucky enough to see many of them (Wicked, Moulin Rouge, Book of Mormon, Hadestown, Hamilton, etc etc). I think we'd like to see at least one straight play, but honestly we're open. I'm leaning away from revivals generally because we're already seeing two revivals...

Here are some things I'm interested in:

* Fat Ham
* Kimberly Akimbo
* Leopoldstadt (we're almost 100% sold on this one?)
* Grey House (technically its opening night is Tuesday, so we could catch the Wednesday matinee)
* A Doll's House
* Life of Pi
* Some Like It Hot (it sounds great; my hesitation is that this one almost certainly will tour...)

Other shows I considered but am less interested in:

* Shucked sounds a little....light to me. 
* I was kind of hoping White Girl in Danger might extend its run, but that sounds unlikely given the early buzz (and perhaps for the best). 
* I like Parade, but I have seen a terrific production of it before, so I prioritized Camelot this time. 
* Funny Girl really doesn't interest me all that much unless Lea Michele really, truly is unmissable, so I feel more lukewarm there.
* I thought about Little Shop, but again, I've seen it many times before, so my interest would be more production/cast-specific. And again, I don't want to spend four days in New York watching nothing but revivals.

12,Is Roxie (Chicago) supposed to be sympathetic?,11uurly,"I finally saw the movie Chicago—unfortunately, I haven’t seen the live version, but since people on this sub rave about the movie, I decided to check it out. 

I get that none of the characters (except, perhaps, for poor Amos) are supposed to be “good.” But while I found Velma, Mama, and Billy Flynn compelling, I had a really hard time with Roxie. I kept wishing she got less screen time so I could have more time with the other characters. I’m not sure if she is supposed to come across as unsympathetic or if I just had a weird reaction to Renee Zellweger’s portrayal. 

Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and I agree with what seems to be the overall opinion of this sub that it’s an excellent way to do a Broadway musical as a movie. But I was thrown off by how unlikeable I found Roxie to be. Thoughts?",HistoryDr,40,80,0.93
13,a review of the shows I saw on Broadway including Sweeney Todd and Shucked,11v99is,"Long time Broadway lover and lurker of this page. Fourth time in NYC and I've seen west end shows too along with Toronto's Mirvish productions so I have exposure to lots of different types of show s  Was in NYC for a few days and saw some shows - here's my review.

Life of Pi: watched the movie when it came out, excited about seeing puppets. We got tickets from TCKTs which were a box with slightly limited view but we saw everything up close which was super cool. Genuinely the most stunning play I've seen, the puppets were incredible and I swear that tiger looked me right in the eye. I would highly recommend seeing this play, well worth the money and an incredibly fun and heart warming experience. 

A Doll's House. Rushed this on TodayTix and had great seats on the balcony. Never seen this before, don't know any other Ibsen. Have seen Jaime Lloyd's Seagull which was good (I think). Obviously the acting is amazing with Jessica Chastain and the story is well told. I enjoyed this more than the Seagull and felt the directing choices made sense more. Lloyd loves minimalism and for this I do think it worked however if you're not into his style you probably won't enjoy this. Also you need to be house right to see the ending. 

Sweeney Todd. Love Sondheim, though this isn't my favorite musical and I've only seen an amateur production before. Booked seats in advance. 26 piece orchestra is phenomenal, lighting and set design is immersive and stunning. The chorus is incredibly talent. Grobans voice is magnificent and I'd say he brings a warmth and gentleness to the Fleet street killer. Ashford I think was the standout performer with great comedic timing and her and Groban's on stage dynamic carried the story. Fisher I struggled to hear over the orchestra but maybe it's where we sat and I think he has the weakest performance of all the stars. Matarazzo was a solid Toby and clearly is at home on stage. Some people have mixed people in choreography but I loved it and thought it was well done. My partner found the accents questionable at times but she is authentically British. Overall, its a great production with solid leads, clearly a massive budget and provides that Broadway experience that one would expect.

Shucked: didn't know anything about this musical except it's about corn and TikTok said it was good. Rushed it the AM and the line was long af. It was enjoyable and I've never laughed that hard in a show in ages. The music is forgettable though digestable minus a few songs and the plot combines classic Broadway tropes while still giving a fresh feel. The cast is solid with one song that gets a standing ovation half way through. Ultimately enjoyable Broadway entertainment and it fills the theater. My biggest complaint is that it falls into romantic tropes where infidelity is glorified while trying to also be progressive in ways so it feels mildly floundering in it's morals. Still glad I saw it and I think it's important to try new works. 

Bottom Line
Our of all the above, life of pi is a must see 
Sweeney Todd delivered and is also a great revival
A Dolls House is great if you're a fan of new imaginings of plays 
Shucked is something you should see if you're trying to find another thing to see and you want something light hearted and fun 

Obviously this is just my opinion so I hope it's helpful for people going to see Broadway shows",katie_vk,3,14,0.89
14,Does anybody like Chicago?,11vpu7b,"I saw Chicago last night with Jinkx Monsoon and I enjoyed it a lot! Every performance was engaged distinct. Jinkx was amazing and the crowed went wiiiiiild for her. I assumed Chicago was this thing everybody loved but then I saw the reviews.

I was shocked at how many of the reviews were outright negative with people calling the show a total rip-off and saying they walked out at intermission. People complained that there are no set changes or costume changes and how the dancing was mediocre. With so many negative reviews it made me wonder how the show has been going for over 20 years. I personally didn’t mind a lot of what was complained about, but I’m also someone who sees Broadway shows regularly and I could understand why someone traveling to New York for a once in a lifetime experience would be let down by this stripped down show and not at all flashy show.

I will say, the show definitely felt its age. The last show I saw before this one was Beetlejuice and the difference is night and day. Compared to Beetejuice, Chicago really felt like one of those 50 year old Disneyworld rides that are open right next to the latest attractions using the newest technology. There’s a huuuuge contrast, the only difference is that at Disney you’re not paying hundreds of dollars per ticket to go on ride. I can see someone who doesn’t know anything about the show being wildly disappointed and upset at how much they paid for an experience they weren’t expecting. I personally don’t mind, I think there’s a charm to the show’s age. The show feels like a milf. Like, the whole production feels like it’s a milf.

Still the audience I was in was a Saturday matinee and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. People were laughing and the songs got surpassingly big cheers although the end the show did get the classic “begrudging standing ovation” where a few Chicago stans (wine moms) will stand up and eventually everyone will have to stand up (people shot up for Jinkx tho). In the end I noticed significantly less “happy faces” after the show was over then I usually see, although I probably wouldn’t have even taken not of that it I didn’t get my world shattered reading all these terrible reviews.

But it made me wonder really what is the deal with this show? If it’s leaving people with frowns on their faces and nothing but disappointment then that makes me sad. 

I’m not capable of liking things unless other people around me like it too so I’m kind of looking for people who generally really like Chicago to explain why and also explain how the show is still going on if it apparently sucks.",PepperPresent443,5,1,0.56

16,I Saw Shucked!,11ve5jo,"I got Shucked tonight! I bought tickets before previews started with the TodayTix deal. I initially was just curious and I love seeing new musicals, and I got so excited when the extreme rave reviews were coming in.

Well, its fine. It's got a great cast (love seeing broadway debuts!), and I personally loved the music even though like many have said it's very forgettable. I read someone's review of it earlier and they called the humor borscht belt-style one liners, and that's exactly it. Almost every joke got a chuckle out of me, but all the humor is pretty much one liners (with Grey's storyteller and Peanut's dialogue almost entirely made up of these). One that my mom couldn't seem to stop dying over was at one point Grey's storyteller says ""You know what they say, a paper airplane that doesn't fly is just stationary"". They're all in the same vain as that.  I saw others call it Book of Mormon level funny - um no not at all lol.

I was excited to see the book was written by the same person that did the Tootsie book (I know that show it hit or miss but I personally loved it), and it just didn't meet my expectations with that either. The story is very basic, and both my mom and I agreed that the rising action and main conflict plot points revolving around corn and rocks and a marriage that was very hasty and clearly shouldn't happen didn't absorb me into the story. I wasn't ever rooting for a character to win or for a couple to end up together because the pacing felt so hasty and the development was shallow. Also beginning the show by revealing what was gonna end up happening at the end didn't help either. The audience knowing more than the characters made the show super low stakes. I honestly think the storyteller characters were my favorite characters in the show, but the plot is so basic that I don't feel like storyteller characters need to be there to explain along the way.

The standing o for LuLu's song was well deserved, give her more!! And the ensemble members pretty much only have parts in the second half of Act 2, give them more too! I noticed that I loved Act 2 as soon as the Yee-Haw song with all the barrel rolling choreography was over, and the scene of all the guys at the bar getting drunk before the wedding was perfect.

I didn't struggle trying to figure out where they were, but the minimal set didn't add to the show at all, especially because the color palette is mostly greens and browns. I was trying to think of a similar show in this respect and I could only think of Come From Away, but I think they did it in a really great and inventive way. Here it felt like they were just missing set pieces or they could really use some more. Everything in the set is slanted in a way that I interpreted to make the scenery more whimsical, but I think it would benefit if the whole stage was framed with a literal bookend or book binding to make it look like its in a story, rather than someone built everything with a lazy eye.

I don't mean to be harsh at all, but I'm really struggling to relate to these rave reviews that popped up immediately. Someone I think posted wondering if they were plants and I mean I don't want to say it, but I think some of them may be.

Bottom line, it's cute but forgettable and also really, really, really corny (get it). I think its up to you and your taste to decide if thats a good or bad thing. Regardless, if you can get a cheap ticket I would say go see it simply because theres hardly anything truly new on Broadway recently and I would love to see something like this succeed in the long run. Also, it's still got at least 2 weeks of previews to go! I can absolutely see this show getting tightened up and edited more",ConfisKate,2,5,0.65

24,Yet another Camelot review,11uoivr,"I went to see Camelot on Wednesday night, and I've been enjoying people's reviews so much that I thought I'd write my own. Overall, I really loved it! I had watched the movie version in preparation, so it was fresh in my mind, and Aaron Sorkin's book is much (much) funnier than the original. Philippa Soo was absolutely AMAZING and Jordan Donica was also terrific. I found Andrew Burnap a bit weaker, as some others have said -- he was funny and good at being in over his head, but not as believable as an inspiring leader. The show was long but I didn't think it dragged at all. The costumes were gorgeous and the spare set worked for me.  
The one (somewhat sizeable) issue I had with the new book is that the ending completely undermined what, to me, is the point of the plot. The original musical is a tragedy -- Guinevere, Lancelot, and Arthur are all good people who love and respect one another and believe deeply in what they're building at Camelot, but all of that is destroyed because Guinevere and Lancelot's love is too powerful to resist. In this version, Guinevere never really loves Lancelot -- she's certainly attracted to him, but it's her jealousy of Arthur and Morgan le Fay that tips her into sleeping with him. We learn at the end that Guinevere and Arthur loved one another all along, but neither one ever said it to the other -- which makes the tragedy more of a silly misunderstanding.  
I found a lot of the choices really interesting -- removing all of the magic was effective, and I was definitely intrigued by the more distant relationship between Guinevere and Arthur all along and wondering how it would be resolved. But I think the ending is a mistake. It definitely didn't ruin the show for me -- I don't go to Broadway very often and I absolutely loved the experience. But to me that was the weakest part of the show.",KeyRecommendation270,7,24,0.96
25,"Help me decide! Shucked, Kimberly Akimbo, or an old favorite?",11uvxy7,"Hi all,

37,Need to rave about Moulin Rouge,11u5832,"Just spent a long car ride listening to the Moulin Rouge soundtrack again, and now I need to get all my love for it off my chest. This is literally going to just be me expressing my love for it, and hoping some other people will share their love for it too!

For some context: I have adored the film version of Moulin Rouge for my entire life. So coming into the Broadway version, I knew I would be a bit biased. 

That being said, I saw the touring cast last May in Chicago and absolutely fell in love. Conor Ryan was amazing, and Nicci Claspell was in for Satine for my show, and she was absolutely phenomenal. Then, when it was announced Aaron Tveit was coming back to Broadway for his limited run, I did indeed fly to NYC and back in less than a day to see him on his second day back. I thought I could not love the show more, but seeing Aaron in it was one of the most amazing things I’ve ever experienced.

I know this show and jukebox shows in general are quite divisive, and honestly, I don’t know if I’m the biggest fan of them usually. However, I just absolutely adore the idea that all of these modern songs are songs that were written by Christian about his love for Satine. It’s such a nice little way to justify it being a jukebox, and I just love the way the medleys are done. 

Rapid fire opinions: My holy trinity is Chandelier, Roxanne, and Crazy Rolling, like many others I assume. I don’t love Karen Olivo as Satine on the soundtrack (I literally don’t know anyone else’s take on this, so it could be widely agreed upon idk). I generally like the plot changes from screen to stage!

It's for children and teens. Ages around 7-16.
If this pilot runs well, in the future I might be able to do a lot more and the end goal is producing big musical theatre productions with children in it. Think Matilda, Annie, Sound of Music etc. 
I work for a semi-professionnal company but the summer camp will be for all children that want to participate.
For the productions we will hold auditions but not the case at this point. 

I am now looking at putting together a fun showcase for the pilot. Should I focus on one show? Or mixing different ones? 

I'm now thinking of 3 different age groups. All groups do a few songs with their group and some will be with all 3 together. 

Will we also do acting scenes or only focusing on the singing and dancing?

Music: Maury Yeston 

Lyrics: Maury Yeston

Book: Arthur Kopit

Premise (per Wikipedia): *Nine* is “based on Frederico Fellini’s semi-autobiographical 1963 film 8 1/2. The show tells the story of film director Guido Contini, who is dreading his imminent 40th birthday and facing a midlife crisis, which is blocking his creative impulses and entangling him in a web of romantic difficulties in early-1960s Venice.” 

*Nine* premiered on Broadway in 1982, directed by Tommy Tune and starring Raul Julia. It won 5 Tony Awards, including Best Musical. Its 2003 revival won Best Revival and Best Supporting Actress for Jane Krakowski. The revival cast included Antonio Banderas, Laura Benanti, and Chita Rivera. 

There is a film adaptation starring Daniel Day Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penelope Cruz, Judy Dench, and others. It can currently be found on HBO Max.

Cindy has a song in the second act before a transition to a bad Cindy reprise that goes one 2 verses longer than it should before the trans. Audible muttering in audience about it. Overall they fail to develop the two main characters… the queen, stepmom, and godmother all perform well and have decent lyrics and music… I think they try to fill the lack of character background on the mains with unnecessary songs. Oh, the theater was a total cluster fuck too… the staff was hair on fire. A pipe and drum band performed outside for half the first act completely overpowering the room.

66,Another Spoiler Review of Sweeney Todd (from an annoying British person who loved the Imelda Staunton production),11th0ka,"I needed somewhere to vent and discuss with fellow Toddians. I will clarify firstly, I love Sweeney Todd. I grew up with both the film but also the Lansbury DVD recording. So as much as it makes me biased, it also makes me annoyingly hypercritical. Added to that, I saw Imelda Staunton and Michael Ball in Sweeney Todd in Chichester, before it transferred to London which I loved. They made it feel fresh and DARK, moving it to the 1930s and really playing into the serial killer aspect.

So me and my friend got tickets an hour before the show tonight and were sat at the back of the orchestra - another thing to take into account, as it maybe swayed my opinion, but we both didn't take much issue with our spot. We also had Groban's understudy, Nicholas Christopher, who was great.

Overall, I enjoyed this show. I didn't love it. My main qualm is the staging and choreography. This is a big stage, why is everything consistently static and downstage. Here is again where I am cursed with comparison. I've got to say, as much as I respect a bold idea for using the bridge as the shop - it just didn't work for me. It created visual restriction with the cables of the bridge intruding visually on performers on the chair for a start. Maybe I'm a purist, but I missed the shop in the middle of the stage as a two tier block and the revolve too. In scenes where either we have the Greek Chorus, or scenes happening concurrently, rather than just being able to use a revolve to keep things moving or just flicking between the two in the shop, separating them between the bridge and then other areas of the stage felt clunky. I respect the attempt to modernize but there seemed to be moments throughout where it felt like the choreography and modern choices would clash with the production. 

Also quick question, does Pirelli's hand coming out of the trunk usually happen in this production? Or is it just not in this production? Found that an odd omission and adds to my point of craving a little bit more black humor in the show - it didn't feel manic enough for me! Ashleigh definitely had moments but wanted just a bit more!

I'm looking forward to seeing it again maybe in 6 months to see if I grow to love this more than enjoying seeing a very well performed production, but this did feel strangely sparse but lacking edge. The chorus didn't feel realized enough either - there was no identity to their characters (again maybe previews). 

As expected, the accents are a bit wonky. I actually found Gaten probably had the closest accent, especially in act one. But we definitely travelled thousands of miles in one show according to the accents tonight. But that's a pet peeve and not surprising.

Anyway that's my venting, but genuinely this show sounds AMAZING. I'm hoping as it progresses they'll smooth out the show, ironically to find some more edge. Annaleigh Ashford is so different to Lansbury and Staunton but I could only respect it, and whilst it took a second to adjust, it's a completely different interpretation so that was refreshing to see! 

Added to that, for Nicholas Christopher's first night, he sounded stunning and really commanded the stage. Whilst curious to see Groban in the future, I was definitely satisfied with Christopher. No disappointment there whatsoever, nor should there be. 

Overall, glad to have seen a new production. Did I leave wanting a little more? Yes but it was still a very enjoyable evening. Interested in hearing thoughts.",judidenchasacat,7,19,0.88

69,Saw Moulin Rouge tonight! Some comments...,11tis6j,"I saw Moulin Rouge tonight! I bought my ticket mainly to see the actors rather than the show itself - I'm not sure why but I've just not had much interest in it. I have never seen the movie, and I have only seem clips of the Broadway show here or there. My friend I was with went in entirely blind and was stunned when they started singing the mid 2010s repertoire lol.

I'm super glad I saw the show, the acting and singing was incredible. I think of all the shows I've seen (I think this is my 35th in the past 6 years since I stated seeing shows) this had the most stellar singers cast in the show. Not a note was missed, and I felt like everyone was EXCEPTIONAL. I've also seen reviews saying that Ashley and Aaron have little chemistry, and I completely disagree. I think the only thing I didn't like from the casting was that Ashley read to be in her early 20s while the leader of the Moulin Rouge seemed to characterize her as someone much older.

My personal comments on the show: Act 1 did not pull me in at all, but I felt enraptured by Act 2. The storyline was kinda slow and whatever in Act 1, but it really picked up later. I absolutely loved all the dancing in Bad Romance and Chandelier, where was this in Act 1 (aside from the CanCan number I guess which felt sloppy to me)? The opening making me feel like I was in the Moulin Rouge and at a club rather than the theatre really took me out of the show because I began focusing on everyone around me and people getting to their seats still. I was never entirely drawn in by the show  - I didn't have a strong connection with the characters at all and the choppiness and lack of flow of the sets made me feel like I was watching vignettes of a movie where I couldn't remember the character's names.

Set design and lighting was spectacular - I loved the way that the entire theatre is incorporated and the only other show I can think of that I've seen that did that has been Cats.

I'm curious if anyone else also feels this way - I hate the fact that it's a jukebox musical. I didn't feel as if the tunes were jammed in and didn't fit (except for the ""love"" song towards the end of Act 1 that had like 20 different love songs in it), but outside of the music everything else is so great I think it would have flowed a lot better if it had all original music. Even if the music isn't great (I'm looking at you Some Like it Hot), I think it would pull the show together as a whole. The only other jukebox show I've seen has been the off-broadway revival of Rock of Ages at New World Stages. I went into that show blind as well and came out LOVING IT. I thought their use of the music was perfect and I can't imagine it with any other music. I repeatedly listen to the cast album for that show. I don't think I'll be doing that for Moulin Rouge. I can't seem to figure out exactly why I feel this way though but I think its mainly because the music doesn't fit the time or really even theming for the most part of the show.

Final comment - the audience SUCKED. There was a constant level of chatter and so much movement. I don't think I've ever seen that many people use the bathroom in the middle of a show. I heard so many shushes, and EVERY SONG as soon as people knew what it was there was a wave of oohs and chuckles. Also so many phones ringing, alarms going off, people trying to record video. Once again, it really took me out of the moment it was honestly absurd.

I think I sound really crabby in this review, I apologize. I did really enjoy my time, and it is quite the spectacle. On my ranked list of favorite shows I put it in 15th place, above Kiss Me Kate and below Phantom of the Opera. Overall I'm giving it a 7.5/10.

I'm seeing Shucked on Saturday and can hardly wait!",ConfisKate,9,8,0.7
70,Bad Cinderella - Standing O.,11svcee,"I had a night off last night so I bought a ticket to Bad Cinderella in a moment of weakness. I bought a $48 ""partial view"" ticket which was the first row of the rear mezz, and it was actually a fantastic seat. Would buy this seat forever moving forward at the Imperial in the future. That said, the ushers at this show were... odd. They were OVERLY enthusiastic and, based on what I heard come out of several of their mouths to different people, it almost seemed like they'd been given a script.

One of them was going around telling people ""you cannot take pictures during the show but you absolutely are allowed to take pictures during the standing ovation!""  She didn't call it bows or curtain call - she said standing ovation. This was before the show started. I know standing o's don't really mean much anymore, unfortunately, because every performance nowadays seems to get a standing o, no matter how good or bad.. but it was still weird and felt presumptuous.  Then another usher came up to the people sitting next to me before the show just gushing about how the show is so great and how they were really just going to love the show, and she said (verbatim) ""you're just really going to love this show! You know how I know? Because every night there's a standing ovation! Every night! That's how you know the show is good - you're gonna love it!""  As the lights were going down she came back and said to the same people ""look at how full it is! Like this every night - people love it, it's so good!""

Then, in the dark as bows started, another usher ran up to our row in the front and pantomimed taking pictures with our phone and pointed at us, then went back to pantomiming taking pics and said, over the music, ""now you can stand and take pictures!!""

Is this really what they're doing? Forcing their staff to push a ""standing ovation"" and put in peoples' heads that that show is 1. good before it even starts, and 2. that's what makes a good show on Broadway? How many people bought tickets at TKTS? Good grief. It really felt like the staff was told to weigh in, which I've never seen before. Also, for all of that, not one of them scanned my ticket or checked my bag. I could have walked right in without a ticket in hand and been just fine.

Lastly, it was a train wreck. It wasn't just bad... it didn't make sense. I like ALW's weird intervals and chords, but even within songs, everything felt disjointed and like it was Frankensteined together. Also if you're familiar with his catalogue, it's very clear that he took A LOT from Woman in White, Stephen Ward, Evita, JCS, and even a little Sunset and Starlight. Nothing really worked and I felt like I was on an amusement park ride that kept taking unexpected 90 degree turns in weird directions. The lead was an understudy making her Bway debut, and she had trouble singing the role, but I'm going to chalk it up to nerves. The performances were as dedicated and good as they could have been, but holy hell if this show was anyone but ALW it wouldn't have ever seen the light of day.

The only thing that I really loved was that it has an Entra'cte, and I wish shows would bring that back. One thing that ALW does super well, and the most enjoyable parts of this show for me, are the strictly instrumental numbers. And somehow the orchestra sounded more lush than you'd think based on the size. Lastly, why is the merch so good?! Wasted on this show, but it was cute.

Edit: ALSO! It's been bothering me until just now, but I just figured out the song ""I Know I Have a Heart"" reminds me of Russell Brand's big song in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" ""Inside of You"" lol. Maybe that's just me.

Edit 2: Sort of an aside, I feel like Andrew Lloyd Webber began to lean hard in to the repeating, equally weighted quarter notes as his signature style around the time of The Beautiful Game, so maybe that's also why all of his newer stuff sounds the same (in addition to blatantly re-using material).",im_not_bovvered,68,150,0.95
71,"Ragtime reunion tickets (I don't think I'm breaking any page rules, but feel free to delete if I am.)",11tmfs5,"To start, I just want to say that I am not selling tickets or looking to purchase any from anyone on this page. 

I don't know how many of you watch MickeyJoTheatre on YouTube, but he's finally coming to New York and said that he had a ticket to the ""Ragtime"" reunion concert. He's not sure if he's going to go because he's going to NYC with his boyfriend, so he's trying to find an extra ticket that didn't cost an arm and a leg so that they could go together.

Even if they are being scalped for insane prices...Are there even tickets available? He mentioned Ebay. I checked and didn't see anything. I also checked SeatGeek and StubHub and a bunch of other sites. Can someone just confirm whether or not it's possible to get tix to this? From what I can tell, even if I were willing to sell a vital organ, I still couldn't get them. But I just wanted to triple check.

After he said that he was trying to get a second one, I just thought, ""WHAT?! HOW?! That's impossible!""  I couldn't believe he had one at all! 🤯

I just wanted to confirm that it actually is impossible. I've Googled til my fingers bled, but everything says it's 1000% sold out.

72,Review of Current Musicals,11t2n38,"Inspired by the positive post about amateur reviews, I'm going to share my very first on this subreddit! Over the past two months or so, I've taken advantage of cheap deals to go through a lot of new-ish musicals with relatively affordable tickets before the tourist season hits. Please bear with my long rambling thoughts!

**Moulin Rouge** (with Ashley & Aaron)
Pro: Spectacle is out of this world. Gorgeous costumes, insane sets. Sword swallowing! Aerial silk dancers! (Don't be like me, arrive early to see the pre-show). But the real sell honestly for me is Aaron. I did not know him from Les Mis but I kid you not, I kept muttering to myself (silently, I'm a good audience member xD), ""Wow he's so hot"" and ""Wow he sounds incredible"" and ""Wow this acting"". I can see that in other hands this romance might've been shallow and this book flop but in his, I really did feel for Christian and his idealism/naivety felt so *sweet* instead of dumb, it's absolutely understandable why Satine would've wanted to protect him while also not being able to resist. Just 10/10 singing & acting and 20/10 charisma. 
Con: The ensemble ""found family"" narrative didn't have enough scenes to really be felt - it lacked ""heart""? Some of the jukebox music is actually pretty silly and they crammed so many songs in it made it even sillier. And most of the songs were not superior to their original version, or used in any particularly clever ways. This may be controversial, but Ashley was a wonderful singer but a weak actress. Compared to Aaron, she left me wondering what was so special about Satine and left me cold at the dilemma/tragedy. 
Other notes: the far side orchestra seats from lottery is partial view but actually really great, you get super close to the ensemble and stars, I do recommend this route. 
OVERALL: I actively want to re-see this show, which is really quite rare. I know I put a handful of cons there but please go while Aaron is still in the role. I can't speak to Derek but Aaron made me understand why people say ""worth the price of admission.""

*Kimberly Akimbo**
Pro: Wonderful book, and unlike many others on Broadway. Grounded and funny and heartwrenching in turns. Like the best play but a musical. Victoria Clark does an absolutely stellar job - she really FEELS like a teenage girl. But I also really enjoyed Justin Cooley. 
Con: It's... like a play, but a musical. I didn't /know/ that was its origins until afterwards, but I'd suspected it strongly. The songs are pleasant but mostly feel like an afterthought, grafted to the scenes and dialogue. The book sort of derails at the end, with the crime plot that you don't even see, though the moving ending sticks the landing. 
Other notes: Got seated in orchestra via TDF. Wonderful seat, rec going this route. 
OVERALL: Go if you generally like slice of life plays, and keep away expectations of life changing music or singing. 

**&Juliet**
Pro: Clever meta plot, really creative uses of the jukebox songs (how they used I Want It That Way by NSYNC still crack me up, lol). Also, the more you know about Shakespeare and Romeo & Juliet, the more some of these jokes will land. 
Con: Surprisingly lacked heart (to me)? I just felt things were corny and too on the nose instead of being moved by them, from Ann's monologues to Juliet's frustration to May's struggles. Like, I got ""bad"" goosebumps at some finger snap lines, and I'm the sort of queer young liberal who studied feminist lit this seems directly targeted at. Didn't help that I thought it was weaker singing & acting than I usually get at Broadway shows. The day I went had a LOT of alternates including Juliet, Romeo, AND May, so maybe it was just my bad luck and the regulars are better at acting, singing, and overall chemistry. 
OVERALL: I'd gotten to go for free (thanks to another reddit member here!), but in retrospect would only go for rush or lottery prices. Potentially my expectations were too high but I left feeling disappointed anyway. 

**SLIH**
Pro: I feel like everyone knows it already, but stellar cast, stellar dancing & spectacle, an updated and effective book, totally solid jazz-esque songs (further elevated by the cast). I want to note I'm cis but I thought how they handled Daphne and Osgood was great, I actually got teary when Osgood sang to Daphne about a butterfly and shared his life story, and also his wink nudge about knowing it all along was a great choice. Really subtle acting by Harrison Ghee & Kevin del Aguila. And on that note, truly no weak links in this cast! I was blown away by basically everybody. 
Con: I don't know? Music isn't ""innovative""? Some people don't like comedy? But I think the latter's a taste thing and not music doesn't have to be innovative to be good. I'm not listening to the soundtrack at home but I enjoyed them immensely during the show.
OVERALL: By far the best all-rounder and ""traditional"" in the best sense. This reminded me of the musicals that were the reasons why I fell in love with musicals in the past. 

**Camelot**
Pro: Philippa Soo. She sounded like an angel, looked like the most beautiful woman in the entire world, and played Guinevere's fiery slash petty slash whipsmart personality to perfection - I think she really elevated this role. Andrew Burnap and Jordan Donica were also great, I could nitpick each performance a bit but honestly it's hard to say how much of it is performance shortcomings vs the book's failures. If you see this show, it's for the cast (and maybe the orchestra? I'm not inclined this way but they were notably good)
Con: The new book is incredibly frustrating. I'm a giant Sorkin fan. Is it funny and snappy, like every Sorkin script? Yes, and I was entertained the entire time. But it is the PERFECT example of the common Sorkin critique, that his characters say lots of funny smart-sounding things without ever really TALKING and when you blink after two hours, he's hardly engaged with the real themes of the work. Democracy & how you must strive towards idealism regardless of how badly the world turns? The confines of female gender roles? What love really is (not lust, but supporting each other to be who we are)? The plot points including the love triangle conclusion were exactly what I want, which makes the execution even more maddening. And people are absolutelt correct, a bad ending will sour impressions, and this one was so corny and abrupt. Add to that the music, which was too lighthearted and a bad fit for this social satire / political drama / romantic drama / tragedy (and yes, this scattered tone was by itself a big issue of the book). Finally, truly I hated this theater, it felt so uncomfortable and cavernous. I understand a minimalist set to highlight the allegorical aspects of this story, but I felt like even the actors must've been annoyed by constantly having to cross that giant set. And I was like, 3 rows back but still feel like I wasn't as close as I wanted to be. 
OVERALL: I love Philippa Soo, I really do. But I absolutely would not sit through this show to see her again. And I'm glad I paid <$40 for my seat. It IS an entertaining show, but definitely ""mixed emotions"" - where the highs are real high but the lows really build up over time, lol. 

**SHUCKED**
Pro: I'm going to cheat and say to look at my recent comments about Shucked on this subreddit 😅 Absolutely hilarious, wholesome, original music with solid cast (Alex Newell & Grey Handson are my picks for standouts, everyone else was servicable). The audience went seriously wild for this at my random Weds 8pm preview show. 
Con: It's like popcorn, satisfying and delicious but won't actually provide any nutrients. The music and book both lack ""heart"" and a deeper layer of conflict that make a musical linger. Staging also was not as impressive as I expect from Broadway, it was basically one set with a couple of big moving props. But you know, sometimes it's just not that serious. Sometimes you just want a good time at the theater. This is it, guaranteed. I'd appreciate them deleting the sort-of homophobic jokes though. It was funny until they implied the character was a closeted dude obsessed with size. 
OVERALL: Go for a reasonable price. I *suspect* this will explode once officially open though, in which case I rec waiting until it inevitably tours or have regional productions. It seems absolutely perfect for that. I wouldn't particularly rush to see this iteration unless you love Newell.",romanticdrift,12,44,0.92
73,Confused by Seat Papering Services - Has Anyone Found a Good Service for Broadway Tickets?,11tit77,"I recently signed up to a few seat papering services, including Theaterextras, Gold Club, Pay by Play, Show-Score, and Club Free Time, in an attempt to get access to Broadway tickets. However, I quickly found out that these services do not actually offer any Broadway tickets, and the events they do offer often misrepresent what they actually are. For example, a concert at Carnegie Hall was described as a well-received orchestra from an American flyover state, but it turned out to be a high school band. Other events ask for a minimum food order of $25 per person, or have a full ticket price of $15, making the administrative charge of $4.50 not much different from just buying a full price ticket.   

I also noticed that papering services seem to copy each other, one papering service will get a listing and just like a newspaper copying another newspaper's headline it looks like the other papering services phone the producer and get a listing themselves. It makes me wonder are they just trying to get people to show up to events that no one wants to go to and they are using the bait of some rare Broadway ticket as bait to get people to pay attention, hungry for that potential ticket to show up.  

I'm wondering if I'm being unreasonable in my expectations, or if I'm simply looking at the wrong time or wrong papering services. Are there any better papering services out there that actually offer Broadway tickets? Has anyone had a good experience with them? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",kittenball_nyc,26,5,0.65
74,Follow Up on my Etiquette Question,11u8url,"Hello everyone,

I saw the BOM tour last Saturday night, and the entire cast was so phenomenal.  I will share my review on it, but before I do that, I'd like to follow up regarding the question I asked regarding etiquette. Before the show, I asked if I were to cheer after every song, if it would bother other audience members.  What ended up happening was that I didn't cheer after every single song, but I did after most of them since I felt that the majority of the songs were deserving of it.  Not only no one was bothered by this, but I wasn't even the only one that cheered after the songs, it really was an energetic crowd.  As a matter of fact, I Believe was the only number where I was the loudest at the end from what I recall, and given how I mentioned numerous times on here how it was that song that made me fall in love with the show, it shouldn't be surprising that I cheered so loudly after that song.  

I think the fact that I attended the Saturday night performance has a lot to do with it as Saturday night crowds tend to be quite energetic in general.  If I was attending a matinee, I'd be more understanding of why you wouldn't want me cheering after many of the songs since older folks typically attend matinee shows and I know they aren't a fan of cheering since back when they were young, cheering wasn't even a thing on Broadway.  Similarly, if I was seeing some Golden Age show like South Pacific, I'd also be understanding of you all not wanting me to cheer after many of the numbers since like I said, cheering at broadway shows was basically non existent during the Golden Age.  However, Book of Mormon is a fun, modern musical, so it's not really surprising that at Saturday night performances especially, the crowd is so lively for the show.

Just thought I'd follow up on this.",jonasnew,5,0,0.18

I know non-union tours will always exist and it’s common for union tours to convert to non-union after touring as union for a few years, but I can’t see how they would be able to get away with completely letting go of union tours mid-run and running them all as non-union… can they get away with something like that?

86,(Another) Camelot review,11sjba3,"Well this was a fun one. Other reviewers have nailed it so far, but I thought I’d add more color since it’s such a new show. 

The good:
- yes it’s true, Philippa Soo is worth all the hype so much hype she’s wonderful. She flounced around the stage in her gorgeous capes and trains, she destroyed all her songs and lines, and I thought she added nuance to Guinevere, who is often played as a flat philandering siren who screws up the entire perfect court. 

- The floor projections bring a lot of the staging to life. From the loge I didn’t have any problems with the set being relatively sparse—the stage itself, like the actual wood, is beautiful and I loved the medieval screens they incorporated. They also have a nice scene where the grand marriage bed kind of follows Guinevere and Lancelot around, and it works. 

- Arthur was amazing? The actor nailed the classic Sorkin delivery of each joke… it was like seeing a young Josh Lyman as king, which I swear is enjoyable. I also found his singing beautiful, and an interesting counterpoint to the very rich and formal singing from Lancelot. 

- The love triangle ending really REALLY worked for me. As a fantasy romance reader, I was RABID when Arthur and Guinevere confessed their love and had one last, forbidden kiss. 

The bad:
- It’s definitely long, as everyone has noted. I truly don’t know what else could be cut. The dialogue didn’t drag or feel cheesy EXCEPT for the kid at the end. Please spare us. 

- The knights were so comically evil. It made me question Arthur’s judgment to have them in his round table. Maybe we’re supposed to see how flawed he is, and how bad of a ruler.

- Agreed that the music felt too light for the subject matter. Sometimes it almost felt like parody having some bouncy jaunty music in the back while a kingdom is crumbling. 

- The seats. The seats! They’re so tiny and squished, at least in the loge. I’m a 5’8”, size 10/12 woman and I was hugging my elbows the whole time. If you’re fluffy, be prepared to squeeze.


ETA: I thought of another thing they could work on. 

The Morgan Le Fay character isn’t great. She’s a scientist who lives in a creepy dungeon, who can apparently See the future (the future is science), and she’s not an alcoholic but everyone thinks she is. Maybe it’s because I read The Mists of Avalon at an impressionable age, but I think she could be much more layered. Arthur is kind of her mirror: he impregnated her at 15 and then immediately became king and had to rule as an unprepared king. Morgan was presumably the same age, and she had to become a mother as an unprepared girl. She can be warped and bitter over time, but it would be nice to see some real anger directed at Arthur for just leaving her behind versus a general weirdness that’s funneled into her terrible son.",seejeynerun,30,38,1.0

88,The Shark is broken Toronto review (2022),11t047h,"I am very convoluted on this show because I don’t exactly know how to rate it, I find that the people who watch this show are gonna think “what the hell was that?” As it’s basically 3 men in a boat talking. I somewhat think they don’t understand that the piece was made as a tribute to Ian Shaw’s late father; I don’t think this show would have worked if Ian wasn’t playing his father because that relationship is so strong. Since his father died when he was younger you can’t help but think exactly what Ian was thinking writing the play which explains how his father felt during the one of the biggest moments of his career. It kind of plays into that concept of not knowing or “what could have been” with his late father and what he thought Robert would have acted on set despite not being near him for too long himself. If you remove Ian from the show this all fades away, and without him it just doesn’t work. It’s long and the script wouldn’t hit as hard. This is the perspective I believe many went into the theatre with which is why they consider it to be “bad” but for me; it works as a personal piece.",uctpe251990,0,3,0.71

99,Question about Broadway strike/load-outs.,11s4j1p,"Someone had mentioned one of the things about Broadway vs. touring was ""you can cut into the stage"". This made me wonder - are Broadway stages merely a big chasm of a swimming pool that each show builds the deck on and configures their own orchestra pit (if it's below stage)? Someone said they thought the Imperial's turntable was a permanent fixture.

I know some shows will raise the deck to get their automation such as turntables and tracks inside, and they'll create pits and lifts as necessary. Are they contracted to replace the stage floor on load out or is that left for the next tenant? I understand the Majestic is getting completely renovated after Phantom but their deck is riddled with traps and slots and tracks for the candles and automation. If a new tenant was moving in immediately, would it be their job to replace that if they wanted a smooth deck for a rollerskating number? Or are production companies contracted to leave the theater in default usable condition with a new deck when they vacate? I suppose it varies by contract?",HanonOndricek,9,23,0.97

108,Kimberly Akimbo vs. Shucked,11sxh48,"Kimberly Akimbo is one of the best shows to hit Broadway in years. It knows exactly the story it wants to tell, doesn’t rely on edgy puns or innuendos, and has so much heart and love put into it with its cast of characters. I haven’t cried as much at the end of Kimberly Akimbo as I have in years at any show. This show is a major contender for the Tony’s this year as it is an incredible piece of art that tells a wonderful, hilarious, and beautiful story of a family that is unstable and doesn’t realize what they have until it’s gone.

Shucked, on the other hand, is a two and a half hour walk through Cobb county with every single line being an edgy innuendo or nonsensical pun about corn that drags out every little corn fueled pun for all it has. By the one hour mark, I’m absolutely exhausted, drained, and just want the show to wrap up. It under utilized its biggest vocal talent, Alex Newlell, for only a single solo, which deserves at least another one in act 2. This show has potential, but it currently uses what it has to tell a cliche romance story and throws it’s funny and original corn story to the back burner until the end.",kwhiggs8,12,0,0.32

Show began 45 minutes late because every single scanner was down and all audience digital tickets had to be individually printed, holding up a line of hundreds. Not the show’s fault, sure. But Bad Cinderella was an inconsistent, plot-hole filled disaster wrapped in a pseudo-rebel ALW bow. The predictable storyline contains uninspired dialogue which somehow manages to make gay subplots and important messages about societal beauty standards and conformity sound corny and out of touch. The lead couldn’t pick a character direction to save her life, creating a confusing and annoying protagonist who would switch in and out of accents and personalities. I cringed in my seat several times when her acting would not land and “comedic” moments of her character only garnered a few scattered laughs. Costumes could have been interesting should they have remained consistent—steampunk-esc corsets and undergarments do not belong with traditional ball attire, so pick a theme and stick with it (plus my god Cinderella’s ball gown felt tacky.

123,Shucked felt much more Jesus-y than I expected,11reyur,"I was lucky enough to get cheap seats to Shucked last night. Overall, I feel positively about the show. The jokes come thick and fast, and while not all of them landed, there were plenty of laugh-out-loud moments for me. The performances, especially the singing, are great. While I didn't feel like the songs themselves were particularly memorable, I think the singing was world-class. Alex Newell is absolutely the standout, and their big song was the best of the show for me. 

That said, I couldn't get past the feeling that maybe I wasn't part of the target audience for the show - which is okay of course. It's not exactly the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, but it's NOT Book of Mormon style humor either - I've seen that comparison a few times now.

The show is very careful to point out that all of the residents of Cobb County are bible-carrying Christians. It's never preachy or even religious, but the characters reference Jesus and Christianity often. For instance, in a number in which nearly the whole cast sings, the much-repeated refrain is >!""We love Jesus, but we drink a little."" !<And it gets a reprise at the end. In fact, the show ends with >!a callback joke about bibles.!<

Now, I'm not saying Jesus doesn't belong on Broadway or that every show has to be targeted to some hypothetical hard-boiled NYC audience. Honestly, I think many people will find all this rather overblown. But for some of us with non-Christian backgrounds, a show that works very hard to let you know that all of it's characters are bible-toting Christians can bring up some odd feelings. I think the show is funny, and I hope it'll be a success, but I figured this was worth mentioning.",IWantYorkBitesBack,54,120,0.78

It's uniqueness made it really interesting. I think the stripped down version of the play highlighted the wittiness of the text that might be overlooked with crazy costumes and set pieces. The actors got to be super specific, and I could see that they were having fun connecting with us! 

If you are looking for a flashy, very typical, very traditional Broadway play, then this of course is not for you. But then why are you looking at seeing an Ibsen play in the first place??

If you, however, appreciate great acting and classic storytelling, this will be for you. As another reviewer said beforehand, you can't come in with any preconceived, egotistical idea of what you want to experience. Just be present, and let the story take you where it leads you! This felt like an authentic and entertaining live theater experience.

It was beautiful, funny, and heartbreaking. Performances from Chastain and Michael Patrick Thorton were what stuck out to me the most (although I also loved arian's bits towards the end). My boyfriend and I both cried, laughed, and felt like the time flew by (He's a finance guy, btw!) Our audience as a whole seemed to really enjoy it too - lots of laughing and engagement. Everyone gave it a standing ovation, and it looked like a sold out theater! I'm seriously confused by all the negativity on this page. 

Also, all of the actors stagedoored afterwards, were super kind, and took their time with everyone.

I'm a teen librarian at a public library in the US. Some of my teens have expressed their love for Broadway musicals. As a fellow musical lover, I was ecstatic! 

I'm hoping to put together a Broadway themed program for them. Do you have any suggestions for crafts or activities that we could do? I don't want it to be simply watching a musical.

So far I'm thinking trivia, create your own Playbill, and maybe design your own canvas art based on your favorite lyric.",dorkylibrarian,15,34,1.0

Andy Karl killed it, Barrett Doss was perfect, it was silly and heartbreaking… it was wonderful. But it was up against DEH at the Tonys and (according to Google) the production was too expensive so it didn’t last long enough to gain the attention it deserved imo. 

I still listen to the soundtrack all the time and can vividly remember certain scenes- the car chase scene especially :) If you’re looking for something new to listen to- give it a try! There Will be Sun, One Day, and If I Had My Time Again are my personal faves ❤️",BobLoblawEsquire,16,35,0.93

149,The Heartbreak of BAD CINDERELLA.,11qegee,"I saw the matinee of Bad Cinderella yesterday, and I can’t stop thinking about it. Not because it was bad — it was — but because it didn’t have to be. There’s a great show in there, there really is. But the way it’s put together is poorly structured, poorly motivated, poorly resolved, and amounts to little more than a thick, jumbled, Webber-coated slice of theatrical disappointment. I want to talk about it. Heck, I want to fix it! But to do so, we’re going to have to talk spoilers.

If you don’t want the show “spoiled” for you, step away from this thread right now. If you’ve seen the show and want to talk about it, or know the show and want to dish, let’s go.

My take is below but the tl;dr is above. The show is bad. Like, really, really bad. Despite a very talented cast who were trying their best to make magic with the terrible deck they’d been dealt. But it didn’t have to be. And, without much work, it could have been really great. Read on.

THE GOOD

There are many stellar performances in the show. Linedy Genao has a modern, mesmerizing voice as Cinderella. Carolee Carmella is a campy delight as the Wicked Stepmother. I want to put Jordan Dobson’s Prince Sebastian in my pocket and make him toddle around with me. The talent is top notch.

So’s the set. The stage and lighting are dynamic, clever, and powerful. At its best, good set, lighting and sound design bring depth to the story — they pull you in. That’s true in spades here. It’s moody. And fantastic. And it fills the stage. (Sure, I could have done without the turntable; but that seems to be a requirement on Broadway these days — if the stage don’t turn are you even on Broadway?)

THE BAD

Here’s the thing. Everything else is bad. A talented cast, a beautiful set, powerful lighting, clever costuming and a gifted orchestra here are crippled by a terribly constructed story, horribly arranged. And no amount of talent can save them.

Do you know about Chekhov’s gun? Chekhov wrote, about storytelling, that “If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off” and it’s like Bad Cinderella takes place in a gun store, and the bullets are in the next city over.

Bad Cinderella’s necklace that she won’t part with? Meaningless. Cinderella’s war with her stepmother over her father’s house? Pointless. Her stepmother’s threat to expose the queen? Idle. Godmother’s warning about midnight? Meritless. A hint that Cinderella is royalty? Unimportant. Prince Sebastian’s marriage-against-his-will? Doesn’t happen. With the possible exception of Prince Charming’s return (an absolutely delightful deus ex machina), there is nothing foreshadowed in this show that comes to fruition. And that’s a problem.

Do you know that trope about rom-coms? About how all of the drama in most rom-coms could be resolved in a single conversation? If the two lover simply talked to each other, they’d discover there is no conflict? And the audience just needs to suspend their disbelief a bit and go along with the romance of it all? 

This entire show it built on that trope — and then we double and triple down on it. Sebastian can’t tell Cinderella he loves her. Cinderella can’t go to the ball. Cinderella needs to be something she’s not. Sebastian needs to be something he’s not. Sebastian can’t recognize Cinderella’s voice. Cinderella can’t get to the church fast enough. Sebastian thinks Cinderella left town. Cinderella thinks Sebastian is married. And none of it is true! These two have been best friends since childhood and yet they don’t seem capable of even basic communication with each other until the FINAL MOMENT OF THE SHOW. Sweet merciful Christmas, that’s a lot of suspension of disbelief.

And worse, this beautiful, talented cast is crippled into roles with no agency, and no motivation. The leads make arbitrary decisions — I guess based on the lies they tell themselves? — that defy explanation. Sebastian literally tells Cinderella to come to the ball exactly as she is and so … she gives away the only thing she’s ever told us she valued (her necklace) to transform into exactly what he’s already told her he doesn’t want?!? I thought the ONE thing we knew about Bad Cinderella was that she was a non-conformist strong-assed woman who doesn’t need to be like everyone else? Why does she abandon her agency again? Why does she abandon who she is again? Why is that a thing she needs to do? Fork if I know.

THE FIX

Here’s the thing. For all of my complaints, the real reason I’m so riled up is because it didn’t have to be this way! The pieces are all there. The motivations are all there. It’s just structured seemingly without the slightest thought as to what it wants to be — what it so clearly dreams of being. Bad Cinderella. A fresh new look at Cinderella through a modern lens. 

So let me tell you the story the way it should be:

ACT 1:

Our show opens in Belleville Town Square. We get to know the townspeople (BUNS ’N’ ROSES / BEAUTY IS OUR DUTY) and we come to know that this town values beauty and conformity above all else. Everyone looks similar. Everyone dresses similarly. Cool. We also learn that Prince Charming is gone and likely never to return , that his brother, Prince Sebastian is not ready to lead (or conform). 

We are led to believe that Belleville is idyllic and perfect and flawless except for that bad apple Cinderella (BAD CINDERELLA) who isn’t interested in conforming and is a bit of an outlaw. She sees the world the way it really is, and tries — through, ahem, the graphic arts (she a graffiti artist, not merely a vandal) — to get her message across. Cinderella defaces the Prince Charming statue — and many other walls in the town, over the course of the song — and is rounded up, captured, and exiled from Belleville.

But Prince Sebastian rescues her. And we learn that the two of them have been friend for many years (SO LONG). He likes her. He likes her use of color. He likes her lack of conformity. We discover, too, that Prince Sebastian has been pining for Cinderella for years.

Cinderella attempts to slip back home like nothing happened, but her stepsisters won’t have that. We meet Cinderella’s stepsisters and her stepmother, and learn that the chateau they’re living in is actually Cinderella’s father’s. They sing about how hard ‘life’ is (UNFAIR) while Cinderella toils around them, putting up with their treatment as an alternative to homelessness and exile. But she’s not defeated. Oh no. She’s a strong independent woman, and their hatred only makes her stronger (EASY TO BE ME). Good for her! 

In the palace, things aren’t going well for Sebastian. He’s not a hunk. He’s not a leader. He’s not interested in conformity. He’s not the man that Belleville needs (HUNK’S SONG). Worse, he needs to be that man. He’s gotta step up, he’s got to take his brother’s place. He’s got to get married and save Belleville (MAN’S MAN). That sucks! Poor Sebastian just wants to be happy. 

But he’s not happy. So he goes to the woods to seek out the one person who might understand him. Cinderella. He meets her in the woods (because she’s still exiled from Belleville) and he pours his heart out to her (ONLY YOU, LONELY YOU). 

But she’s not interested in rescuing him from the mess he’s in. She’s not interested in playing games or pretending. She’s not looking for some Prince to save (BAD CINDERELLA REPRISE), she’s done with Belleville and moving on.

Poor Sebastian! So he abandons who he is (I’M NO LONGER ME) and agrees to his mom’s plan for a ball followed immediately by a wedding. He agrees that he’ll kiss a girl at midnight, and marry her the next day.

So everybody in Belleville is excited about the ball (and the wedding), and Sebastian is resigned to his role. As the townspeople parade themselves for Sebastian (THE VILLAGE SQUARE), Cinderella tries to sneak out of town. But Sebastian! Her only friend! Can she abandon him? He sees her! He calls out to her! But the villagers build a human barricade and shield him from her, decry how ugly she is and how unwelcome she is, and shame her for who she is, driving her (again) out of town.

At Cinderella’s chateau, her stepsisters and stepmother prepare for the ball, but there’s no sign of Cinderella. Good riddance. The three get ready for the ball (UNFAIR REPRISE).

But Cinderella doesn’t leave. Oh no. She’s not going to let these townspeople control her fate. She’d leave on her own terms, sure, but she won’t be swept under the rug. She won’t be disappeared. So she goes to Godmother’s, looking for some help slipping back into town (and slipping into the ball).

But things get out of hand (BEAUTY HAS A PRICE) and Cinderella is transformed. But wait! Cinderella can’t pay! So, in a ‘try before you buy’ situation, Godmother lets her leave, but tells her it’ll only hold until midnight. (And she must return the shoes the next day, or she’ll lose her deposit). Whatever. Good enough for Cinderella. She runs off to the ball.

ACT 2:

It’s the Prince’s ball (THE BALL) and everybody’s vying for Sebastian’s attention — especially the two stepsisters. Cinderella arrives, but — what’s this? — she has a British accent now (and can’t shake it); she looks so different and sounds so different that Sebastian doesn’t even know it’s her! Cinderella is dejected. As the clock strikes midnight, the stepsisters fight to get to Sebastian, finally planting kisses on him (simultaneously, one on each cheek). 

Cinderella’s disguise starts to slip away and she runs from the ball, losing a glass slipper (and her wig) as she goes. Her stepmother recognizes her and stops her at the door, but Cinderella shouts out “Leave me alone!” (In her own voice, which has returned because it’s after midnight now). As Cinderella exits, Sebastian, hearing her voice, calls out for her, but she’s not there. He finds only a shoe.

Cinderella, realizing that Sebastian is the only thing that ever mattered to her (I KNOW I HAVE A HEART BECAUSE YOU BROKE IT), packs up her belongings at the chateau, hell-bent on leaving town. But her steps arrive, so she hides in the fireplace.

Her stepmother and stepsisters celebrate (MOMENT OF TRIUMPH) and prepare for the double-wedding — yes, Sebastian is going to marry both of them. Cinderella sneezes, her stepmother pulls her from the fireplace, mocks her for her stupidity, tells her when she hears the church bells she’ll know it’s done, and then — in an act of supreme hubris — signs the crappy little chateau over to Cinderella, since they’ll be living in the royal palace now. Cinderella, dejected, begins to spray paint the walls of the chateau.

Cut to the royal wedding. At the cathedral, the ceremony begins (THE WEDDING MARCH), but Sebastian can’t bring himself to say “I do.” They start and re-start the vows in a comic bit where both of the sisters say I do, try to move his mouth to say I do, even have their stepmother say “I do” for him in a deep manly voice, but it doesn’t work. His mother shames him to be more like his brother, and — on cue — Prince Charming re-appears (MAN’S MAN REPRISE).

Charming instructs us all to marry for love (MARRY FOR LOVE) and introduces everyone to his boyfriend/fiance. They wed (THE WEDDING PARTY) and, as the two kiss and the church bells ring out, and the stepsisters and their mom slunk away.

Cinderella has created a masterpiece on the walls of the chateau. A ‘Bad Cinderella’ mural in spray paint and tears that is lovely and heartbreaking. She hears the church bells and (CINDERELLA’S SOLILOQUY) realizes that she’s lost the only person she ever loved. She hears a noise and hides in the fireplace again.

Prince Sebastian arrives. He admires her amazing mural. He finds the other shoe. He sings to it. Cinderella emerges from the fireplace (FINAL SCENE) and they kiss.

FINALE:

The stepsisters and stepmother try to slip back into Cinderella’s chateau but — uh oh — the locks have changed. They pound on the door shouting Cinderella’s name, but no one comes. Thunder cracks as it starts to rain and they run into the woods. There’s no place for them anymore in Belleville. 

Speaking of Belleville, the town in inexorably changed — by Prince Charming’s return, by Prince Sebastian’s love of art, and by Cinderella’s influence. Every wall is colored with art. Every person is dressed like an individual. There is no conformity, and no one wants it. The people of Belleville are, finally, happy. Because we’re all Bad Cinderella on the inside (BAD CINDERELLA REPRISE).

150,My weekend of shows,11qithm,"Just finished up a weekend of shows and I'm stuck at the airport for a few hours

& Juliet - digital rush ticket, center mezz row DD. I normally hate mezz but this was a pretty decent seat. Lots of understudies including the amazing Rachel Webb for Juliet. Betsy Wolfe was the highlight for me. I grew up in the 90s so this was right up my alley. I had a ton of fun and it was a great way to start my weekend

Kimberly Akimbo - in-person rush, orchestra right row B. Partially obstructed due to a completely unnecessary chair in the scenes that take place in Kimberly's house. I could still mostly see but people further over or closer probably missed quite a bit. I loved this show, it was my main reason for coming on this trip. Victoria Clark was out, which I knew. Colleen was great, but the supporting cast outshone her a little bit. I cried a few times. I'd love to see it again, I hope it tours.

Shucked - when I was planning my trip I really wasn't sure what would go in this slot. I thought maybe Parade, but in the end I decided to go with this (which was fortunate, since the corresponding performance of Parade was cancelled). I ended up buying my Shucked ticket the day before at the box office, willing to spend a bit since I saved money nabbing rush for & Juliet. A lot has been said about this show already. I laughed a ton and didn't care that it was mostly puns and one-liners. The storytellers and Alex Newell were the standouts for me. I sat second row mezz on the aisle (knowing leg room is terrible up there) and had a great view. 

Sweeney Todd - I was really impressed with this. I was skeptical of Josh and Annaleigh headed in, and bought my ticket for Ruthie Anne Miles (who blew me away as expected), but both leads really pleasantly surprised me. I sat orchestra left row H, had a fantastic view with no obstructions (although I think orch right might be the better choice for this production). As a bonus I ran into Martin Short at intermission. The show started at about 315 and I wasn't on the street until after 6. Hopefully they tighten it up as previews go on.

Titanique - Sunday evening options are slim, and I'd already seen Little Shop twice, so I took a chance on this. I don't have any strong feelings about Celine Dion, but I love Titanic. This was fun and worth the 33 dollars I paid, but it didn't leave much of an impression on me. I did have another female lead understudy with Courtney Bassett going on as Celine, she was really great. I sat up in the cheap seats, row P, but it's probably way more fun up close

Overall a great weekend of shows and worth the trip! Not sure when I'll get back, hopefully in the late summer/early fall",angoradebs,22,75,0.99

176,Would love some insight from those who have seen MJ,11pl0i0,"We live in the Midwest, and my daughter (HS Freshman) is in NYC with her HS chorus group. Last night they saw MJ - she was very excited to see a show on Broadway, but it wouldn't have been anywhere near her top choice. (For context, she's seen Hamilton x2 and DEH on tour, plus tons of regional shows, and of course, slime tutorials.)

At intermission, she texted me:

""OMG. My jaw was literally dropped the entire time. This is insane. Everyone is like freaking out cause its so good. The dancing and the lights and the set, it's so crazy omg.""

Then after the show:

""I can't even think a thought right now. I'm crying and my chest hurts that was absolutely insane.""

""That was singlehandedly the most amazing experience of my entire life. Like seriously. Every single person was like sobbing and like speechless at the end and omg.""

""Thriller was the best scene I've seen in anything in person or online, like anywhere. The act one finale was also amazing omg.""

She's normally a very calm and measured kid, she never texts like this, and I can't remember the last time I heard her this enthused about anything. Now, I know MJ won a bunch of Tonys so there's obviously something good going on, but overall, the reviews I've read have been mixed.

Can anyone who's seen MJ provide any insight as to what caused this group of Midwestern theater kids to absolutely lose their sh!t at MJ last night? :)

She said she would like to see a fairly easy to follow show since she doesn’t know much English, and knowing her, here are some of the shows I think she would enjoy:

Some shows that should give you an idea but are probably out of the budget:

- Six. I don’t know if it’s that easy to follow along with actually, but I felt like she might enjoy the poppy feel. Either way it’s a little bit way out of our budget.

- Moulin Rouge. I realized I was assuming my mom already knew what Moulin Rouge was, but apparently not so! So maybe I can show her the movie as well.

Some shows that might be in the budget??:

- Bob Fosse’s Dancin’

- MJ. I’m not entirely interested in seeing this but I feel like I can be convinced.

- And Juliet. This one seems like the most interesting to me, although I don’t know much about it. So if anyone can tell me more about this show I’d love to hear, thank you!

I’ve also told her about the option of buying rush tickets, although I’m not very experienced with that, so if there’s anything you think I should know about that it would be much appreciated as well.

179,A Review of Beetlejuice from someone who never saw it on Broadway,11pj1zu,"Hey Guys! Just saw the tour of Beetlejuice yesterday and wanted to share my opinions as a noob who only listened to the OCR and creeped on Reddit/YouTube videos. 

First of all, I was very nervous about Beetlejuice as we all know that Alex Brightman  is phenomenal and seeing other reviews on Justin Collette made me excited. I'm happy to report that he was phenomenal and does have a bit of the voice going on. My hubby had always gotten a bit of a Jack Black vibe from Alex which was not his thing, but made sense with School of Rock. However, he very quickly whispered to me (I know) that he was getting more Charlie Day energy which is way more his speed and enjoyed the show way more than he initially anticipated. 

Next, Isabella Esler is absolutely incredible as Lydia. She has a voice on her and I can't believe she's fresh out of high school. That girl is going to be a star. Hubby was a bit disappointed in the writing of Lydia saying she was too cheery and needed to be written with Wednesday Addams/Aubrey Plaza in mind. And I can see where he's coming from, but not sure it would fit the vibes of how they wanted the musical. 

Overall the rest of the cast was great, although not as spectacular as Leslie Kritzer, Rob McClure, and Kerry Butler which I think made the show drag a bit as I found myself only caring about Lydia & Beetlejuice. However, special shout-out to Britney Coleman who was great the best of those three parts and it's good to see her finding success (sucks YASSSSS!) after AVPM. 

Speaking of Britney/Barbara, there was a bit of a funny mishap with the book coming down and bouncing on her foot which she then kicked when she should be dead. This resulted in Beetlejuice double checking her pulse to make sure she was in fact dead. So with no hole in the stage, other mishaps can still happen! It was a great moment. 

Lastly I thought the sets and projections were great for someone who doesn't know any better. It was also good to see the sandworm!

Overall it was a great time and I would still encourage others to see the tour. Scaled back or not, it was still a good day of theatre with some good laughs.",Mrs-Drew,2,35,0.98

So in April my mom and I are going to New York for the first time and are hoping to see two shows. The deal is that I pick one and she picks one, she almost immediately chose Funny Girl. I eventually landed on wanting to see little shop. My reasoning for this is that it’s a show that I’m very familiar with and something that just feels very broadway to me (yes I know it’s off broadway but you get the point) The problem is that mom doesn’t want to see little shop mainly because we have seen it in the past, this doesn’t bother me however since I was relatively little when we saw it and I can imagine seeing it in New York is very different experience. She told me to just think about it and that it may be worth seeing something new. 

Little Shop just feels like a safe option and something that I know I’d have good time at and positive experience. But if I were to choose a different show it’d be between Hadestown and Sweeney Todd. I’m basically not at all familiar with hadestown but I hear nothing but just insane praise for it. And I’m vaguely familiar with Sweeney Todd.

201,I saw Shucked. It was underwhelming [No Major Spoilers],11ouycm,"The best way to think about this show is as a block of marble; inside somewhere, there is a great show, but there needs to be **significant** work done to get rid of the excess before it can be exceptional. It's in previews, so I'm holding out hope that it improves, but numbers, an enormity of jokes, and perhaps a couple of characters need to be cut. Here are some things that stick out:

* Too corny. Yes, I know it is supposed to be corny. It is self-aware and meta, which it touts as a selling point, but it gets old... quick. The show is inundated with puns and dad jokes, 90% of which are out of place and distracting. For example, Maizy and Beau are in an emotional discussion, and within it, each of them make jokes that sound like stand-up comedy routines.
* This leads to my second issue: everyone is a comic. **Every** character in this show has lines that belong in a stand-up routine. One character, Peanut, is wholly made up of these one-liners. The storytellers (who are omniscient) would make one liners, most of which were funny. But after the tenth time, it really gets old and distracting. By 45 minutes into the show, I mentally tuned out every time a character started a line with ""**that's like when...** \[insert pun/joke that has zero relevance to the story\]
* The characters are mostly uncompelling. Our main character is actually deeply unlikeable, yet we are encouraged to root for her. The constant one-liners distract and pull away from the characters' plotlines.
* The numbers are not bad! The opening number is fun, upbeat, and enjoyable, which made me even more disappointed when the plot became simplistic and uninteresting. They vary in how good they are, Lulu sings a powerful number, and Beau sings a real toe-tapper. Gordy has an odd and uncatchy song. The one gripe I have with the music is that very few, if any, of the songs advance the plot. They are mostly just telling us a bit about the character over and over again. Each song can cut a verse and be fine. A duet is sung about how two characters are friends, even during an extremely pivotal moment of the show, it is sung and then immediately ignored as they move onto advance the plot. It felt as if the song was spliced in just because.
* The choreography is (mostly) great. A **really** fun number involves Beau and the boys in Act II. It is extremely movement and prop oriented and really shows off the hard work and talent the entire cast has. One awful moment was during Beau's solo number wherein he stands alone onstage, standing still for probably no less than 90 seconds in what was an awkward lapse in blocking or choreography.
* The plot was also uncompelling. In the interest of avoiding spoilers I won't add specifics, but there is not much about the plot that is original, makes you think, or is memorable. For a moment at the end of Act I it seems like a solid story is being developed, but the stakes are quickly removed, leaving the audience to look forward to another act of stand-up one-liners.
* There are a lot of really funny jokes, many unfunny ones, and mostly they were out of place. It just did not mesh with the plot, the music or anything else. It felt like the jokes came first and everything else second. That and there was an unsavory homophobic/toxically masculine joke that was very out of place, as well as a part in a song in which a character shares his plan to S/A another character-- kind of odd.

I've been tough here, but overall it was not a bad show. The errors are numerous and glaring, but still in the end the show made for a fun time. If you don't care much about plot or things making sense but prefer an enormity of puns and dad jokes, then this show is for you.

204,A biased review of The Secret Garden,11pkknu,"ThU SaY-cRuH’ GoH-‘eN at The Ahmanson (review) 

Disclaimer: I’m English, so that definitely affected my view of the performance. But perhaps this review will be relevant to you if you are English, watch English TV shows, or have ears. 

I saw The Secret Garden last night and I cannot overstate how atrocious it was.

I could write a book about it, it was so appalling, but I suppose I am definitely more sensitive to all its failures, being from England. But I think it’s inexcusable at this level of theatre to have accent work as shoddy as this show does. I’m not trying to be melodramatic, but it was actually offensively bad at parts, like when someone mocks the way you talk in school as a child.

I’m not a snob, and I know accents can be hard for people, which is why I was relieved (or expecting) to find that the accent work of much of the supporting cast was between passable and excellent. I can tolerate Tyrion in Game of Thrones just fine, the point is as long as it’s close enough, and has a clear and consistent identity, that’s enough to not think about it and enjoy the script for what it is.

But when the three main characters have accents so shoddy they wouldn’t be out of place on the most basic, unrehearsed am dram or school play, it couldn’t be more jarring in a city with one of the biggest acting pools on the planet, and a show asking premium ticket prices. For the same money, I’ve seen Hades Town, Rent, and the sublime The Band’s Visit, which makes watching literal middle school level performances all the more inexcusable.

I’m a very casual theatre fan so I’m not sure if it’s kosher to criticise the performances of children. But neither is it kosher to spend premium ticket prices to watch middle school level performances, so hey ho. For the record, I blame responsible adults for the following, and especially the director, who is ultimately responsible for the final state of the play. 

That being said, I really can’t overstate how fucking abominable the acting and accent work of the two main children are. In a show that is sensibly happy not to get hung up on realism, with race swapped characters and hunchbacks with no hunch, it makes zero artistic sense to force the children (or the actor playing Dickon) to perform accents it seems their brains are simply incapable of comprehending. With Mary and Colin, it’s like their understanding of an English accent is ‘say every single vowel and syllable like an alien, but a brand new alien every time’. There’s no excuse for any competent director to let a show play like this. My niece, aged 8, would do an English accent like this, and it’s the work of someone who literally doesn’t know any better, hasn’t had feedback before, and hasn’t ever practiced it. So it’s indefensible that people are paying money to hear the exact same thing. Nothing would have been lost if the children had just been allowed to perform in their regular accents, and in fact, everything would have been gained, because the audience would get to hear the majority of the dialogue in a manner that actually sounds human.

And not to let Dickon off lightly, because he’s an actual adult. His voice was majestic, to give him credit, but it’s not enough just to have a good voice. Once again, either permit him to just use his regular voice, or accept you have the wrong casting and keep looking. Out of all the adults, his accent work was the worst. At first I was convinced he was going for a semi passable Scottish accent, but that notion was rudely shattered when he switched to lurching between Mary Poppins and every region of an alternate universe England - but never (crucially) the real one.

I wish it ended there but the delivery of the two child actors is really abominable too. Again, all blame levelled at responsible adults here. Presumably they cannot showcase their acting skills when being forced to murder a dialogue they do not comprehend. But their delivery for every line ranged between flat, shouty, comical and demented. If that was a movie shoot, any semi competent director would be yelling ‘CUT!’ after each single line. So the fact it has been allowed to hit the stage in that state is truly unforgivable. There’s no end of talent in Los Angeles, so a performance like this really makes you think about nepotism in the creative industry, because how else are kids getting roles they absolutely are not qualified for outside of ‘can sing well’? (And to be brutally honest, that only applies to Mary. Colin was not a strong singer).

Sadly, that’s not the only downside to this production. The sets are artistic initially but incredibly barebones, supported tonally by staging and movement that is completely and utterly lifeless. Dickon’s character and his effervescent hopscotching ‘fiddle dee fiddle roo’ type character is entirely at odds with the production which is as dreary, bleak and hollow as it gets. He might have been a breath of fresh air in another production, but in this he is just firmly a part of the bizarro-world they have constructed, where serious characters and serious lines are delivered so poorly they become comical.

Perhaps this complaint comes from going into this show blind and expecting more of a musical than a sort of hybrid opera, but hardly any of the music grabbed me, even if the cast did have mostly excellent singing voices. The band was flat and sadly none of the musical moments really offered a reprieve from the painful delivery of the main characters.

Perhaps the staging and direction is secretly tonal genius, because arguably the biggest originating flaw is the actual musical is dull as dishwater. I’m not sure the original story holds up all that well to start, but it seems to have lost even more in translation. Nothing happens. There’s no stakes, no drama, and attempting to add any in a cartoon villain who is keeping Colin in bed, but that is never really explained and whose motives are only ever hinted at (and make zero sense) utterly fails to add intrigue to this absolute yawn of a play. Literally nothing happens, either staging wise, plot wise, or musically.

Sadly, it’s the worst theatrical experience I’ve had in many many years. Just glad I didn’t stump for the expensive seats.",LegaliseEmojis,6,0,0.5

I see on average 40 shows or so a year and I feel like more shows than not there is some kind of annoyance either snacks, talking, singing, texting, photos, watches, drunk/disorderly conduct, etc. 

Is it worth writing a letter to the theaters or the organizations (Nederlander, Shubert, etc.)? To know that this is beyond the point of unacceptable? I am just really annoyed that people can think that they can do whatever they want, including being incredibly disruptive. The announcements don't say crap about phones beyond photos or recording, which we know people don't listen to either way.

The music is very country (more folk country) but without the banjos or hard twang (there is a bit of twang).  Several of the songs are toe tapping fun and upbeat and a couple of the ballads are just beautiful in a simple way.

The casting is perfect, everyone is right for their roles.

The plot isn't anything groundbreaking but enjoyable enough.  It's very hallmark movie romance but more simple.  A simple romance with a happy ending.

I took my husband (army man, favorite musical Hadestown) and my daughter (19 ballet dancer and college student -- favorite show ABT performing Romeo and Juliet) and they both really enjoyed it (and my daughter did not want to go, husband went because I wanted to go).  Their only complaint was that it was too long (although I think the only show my husband hasn't complained about being too long was Six).

The show is fairly clean and unoffensive, I wouldn't hesitate to take my elderly parents from Oklahoma or a ten year old to the show.  There are a few off color jokes but they're very mild and would either fly over the head of a young watcher or are very inoffensive.  

I'm interested to see how this sells.  It very well could be a hit show for tourists because it's fun and heartwarming.

Don't think something like a Bonnie & Clyde, &Juliet or Back to the Future is for me, say (nothing wrong with the shows! just not my taste).

Would love a musical that feels new and exciting. I know London has a thriving offering of straight plays, so interested to hear what's buzzy in that regard too.

Would be interested to understand just how the West End works, in general.

230,My review of Camelot,11ocj8g,"So I got a last-minute ticket from a friend tonight and saw Camelot by myself. While it's wonderful getting to see a show for free, the downside is that I have no one to talk about it with so I thought I'd share my thoughts with you gracious Redditors. ;-)

The good: 
-Performances are for the most part strong, with Phillipa Soo as usual crushing it with her gorgeous, silvery soprano and Jordan Danica really stepping up to the plate. I had previously seen him as Freddie in My Fair Lady and had no idea he was such a strong baritone.

-Never saw the original show, but suspect Aaron Sorkin punched up the jokes quite a bit. The dialogue reads as fairly contemporary and engages you in the story quickly.

The bad:
-Man, there is a reason why Camelot is not revived often. It uses a lot of the same musical themes you'll hear in their better shows but does them. . . not as well. Think of it as My Fair Lady but with three-quarters of the show all Professor Higgins songs. Even worse, the songs are often too lighthearted to mesh with the darker themes of war and betrayal in this show. I suspect that Sorkin added a lot of stuff about democracy on top of that, which is even less helpful.

-Production is fairly stripped down with few dance numbers, keeping the focus on the music - which again is a mixed blessing.

-Although clearly very talented, Andrew Burnap was not quite as strong as Phillipa/Jordan. I think he was impacted by some sound mixing issues that caused the singers to be too quiet at times. While he is very likeable and sings well, he just didn't have the chemistry and powerhouse singing you saw from the other two, I kept wondering what this show would have been like with Aaron Tveit in the role.

So is it worth seeing? You will get to hear two fantastic performers and one great song (If Ever I Would Leave You), and if you're already familiar with Camelot and aren't bothered by its flaws (heck, I enjoyed seeing Brigadoon at Encores just for the songs and had no problem ignoring the book) then you'll find it worthwhile. For everyone else, I'd recommend setting your expectations appropriately, and also bear in mind that the show is also 3 hours long and the ending is not super satisfying.",90Dfanatic,9,30,0.95

There is a group of theater followers on Reddit hell bent that this show fail. It’s obvious because of the amount of mostly negative reviews during previews (before the show has a chance to tighten things up). Very unusual! Many are just mimicking others because they want to appear cultured and fear that admitting it is a fun, good night out makes them less culturally aware. I see  a lot of “price bashing”. People saying don’t pay more than this or that. Or you can get tickets for $10. (Not really true unless a lottery or from special organization promotion)

I’ve seen hundred of shows. I’m a season ticket holder at a few theaters. At Bad Cinderella , I never saw anyone rush to leave the theater during intermissions. NO ONE was asking for refunds. I never saw an embarrassed cast. All Hogwash!!  Audiences seemed to have a good time. These “reviewers” are trying to drag down tickets sales or discourage purchasing. They don’t like ALW, they don’t like shows without deep meaning and they go into BC wanting to dislike it and pick it apart. Perhaps they don’t like large ensemble musicals featuring many beautiful people. Perhaps they were friends with the British cast. Who knows what motivates this kind of negativity. This is so disrespectful to the cast and crew. 

BC is as coherent as LaLa Land (the movie), Moulin Rouge or Spring Awakening. All which had plot holes  or some lack of coherent story.  I still appreciated those shows for their good parts. So many have commented “Its not as bad as I heard”. Well I’m guessing they went into the show expecting it to be bad instead of with an untainted outlook. How can one then be a neutral reviewer. From what I’m seeing all the bad is coming from just a few (jackfruit9894) people.

The show is fun.It is LARGE! It makes you laugh. It will put you in a good mood. A few of the songs are memorable like “Bad Cinderella”. Others are not. Like all musicals some actors are good ,some are not. The script is not perfect but if you know the story of Cinderella you should be able to figure it out. Outstanding performances by the Queen and Stepmother. Stepsisters are great also,  playing off each other well for comic relief. Godmother has a great voice. Would have loved to see more of her. Leads are good and growing into their roles. Give them a chance. This could be your sister or brother, son or daughter!! . Dancing is great. Ensemble terrific!  Costumes worth coming to see. Love the surprise ending. If you like Aladdin, Frozen, Moulin Rouge or Jesus Christ Superstar you will probably like this. If you prefer off broadway , meaningful or small cast musicals this is not for you. Be your own judge. Don’t be a lemming.",Ladyxcess,19,0,0.42
241,Best Musical for a Movie Musical Fan?,11o7c3y,"I'm headed to NY in two weeks, and want to catch a show.  Most of my experience of musicals comes from movie musicals.  I don't know if this will get me disbarred from this sub. 

I did see Lion King twice on Broadway (just happened to be the show we got tickets to both times) and loved it. 

What would you recommend for someone who's a fan of movie musicals?  I would have loved to see Mean Girls or Legally Blonde (non-musicals turned-musical), Hairspray, or something like The Last Five Years if they were on. 

I'm a big fan of Maude Apatow, but don't know much about the story/songs from Little Shop of Horrors.

245,Musical of the Week,11o3sx6,"Musical: *Dreamgirls*

Music: Henry Krieger 

Lyrics: Tom Eyen 

Book: Tom Eyen

Premise (per Wikipedia): *Dreamgirls* is “based on the show business aspirations and successes of R&B acts such as The Shirelles James Brown, Jackie Wilson, and others, but closely follows the story of The Supremes as the musical follows the story of a young Black female singing trio from Chicago called ""The Dreams"", who become music superstars.” 

*Dreamgirls* premiered on Broadway in 1981. With an original cast including Jennifer Holliday and Sheryl Lee Ralph, the show was nominated for 13 Tony Awards, winning 6. 

There is a film adaptation starring Jennifer Hudson, Beyoncé, and Anika Noni Rose. It does not appear to be streaming anywhere right now. 


Here are some questions to give you ideas of what to talk about / what to look for as you listen to the album, but feel free to talk about whatever stands out to you about the musical. 

- What was your favorite part of the musical? What was your least favorite?

- Which song has stuck with you the most?

- What surprised you most about this musical?

- Did this musical remind you of any other musicals?

- How did it impact you? Do you think you'll remember it in a few months or years? Would you ever consider re-watching it? Why or why not?

- Which characters did you like best? Which did you like least? Which character did you relate to, or empathize with, the most?

- Are there any areas you wished the musical had elaborated upon further?

274,"Over a year later, I’m thinking about the reaction to the Dear Evan Hansen movie and why it got to me so much",11nak1o,"And I didn’t even like the DEH movie, it’s a bad movie and a worse representation of the original musical. But in the years leading up to it, I was excited for it, I badly WANTED it to be good. A DEH movie adaptation SHOULD have been better. So of course I was sorely disappointed that it turned out as poorly as it did. I hate what it’s done to the DEH fandom and community at large, I wish it never existed, but I just don’t have it in me to hate it, I really don’t.

Yet every time I saw a thumbnail or video title or headline or Tiktok screaming about how terrible it was, I felt physically ill, and for a while I didn’t know why. Sure, I wanted to like it and was disappointed at it not being good when other musicals got great movie adaptations in the same year, but I’d never felt as sick as I did.

And then it hit me - a lot of the people slandering the DEH movie were ALSO slandering the musical.

Think about what usually happens when a beloved property gets a bad adaptation. A lot of the reactions online tend to be comparing what it did wrong to what the original did right. Take HBO Max’s Velma, which much like the DEH movie has become the biggest *thing to hate on the Internet*, yet the backlash against it included people giving attention to superior incarnations of Scooby Doo, stating what they did right compared to what Velma did wrong.

People weren’t doing that here - they were tearing into DEH musical and all. A lot of them seemed to be REALLY happy about it too - and sure, I FULLY get the appeal of tearing into a terrible movie and watching/listening to video essays on everything they did wrong, but a lot of the people doing the worst of it already didn’t like DEH and were positively giddy at the chance to prove they were always right. 

There were so, so few perspectives from people like me, who love the DEH musical and who wanted the movie to be good and were crushed it wasn’t. It’s why I didn’t have a problem with criticism of the movie coming from my friends who love it or from the DEH subreddit - because that criticism is coming from the same place of disappointment as I am.

I watched DEH on stage on London not long after watching the movie twice with different groups of friends and I can’t tell you how HEALING it was. The songs they cut out of the movie have a serious impact on the tone and stakes and the stage medium really emphasises the feelings of isolation that are so prevalent throughout the story. 

Sure, a lot of people will say that they’ve always hated it and how it was awarded over Great Comet at the Tonys, and I’m not gonna act like the original musical doesn’t have problems. But Dear Evan Hansen the musical managed to take a character that lies to a grieving family about being best friends with their son who killed himself, and STILL made him likeable and sympathetic. That is a feat nothing short of MAGIC.

285,In Defense of Josh Groban as Sweeney Todd,11mi52a,"Disclaimer: I adore Josh Groban. I would defend him in regards to most anything. I am definitely not objective.

Common Complaint #1: He’s too young.

I did a bit of research. I am currently twenty-six years old. In fifteen years, I will be forty-one, Josh Groban’s current age. I do not personally have children but I know plenty of people at or around my age who do. The average marrying age of English men and women in the mid-1800’s was twenty-six. It is entirely plausible that Benjamin Barker married at twenty-three or twenty-four, had Johanna at twenty-four or twenty-five, and was arrested at twenty-five or twenty-six. (We know, at least if we trust Mrs. Lovett, that Johanna was a year old when her father was arrested.) So, fast forward fifteen years, Sweeney would be forty-one.

Common Complaint #2: His Image is Too “Good” to Play Sweeney Todd

Josh Groban is an actor. Granted, he could certainly be considered a singer who acts but he is still, in my personal opinion, a very talented actor. I think that Josh having that “good guy” public image makes his portrayal of Sweeney all the more compelling. After all, Benjamin Barker presumably had a “good guy” public image. It was false charges he was sent away on, after all. Besides, Jeremy Jordan also has a “good guy” public image (albeit not as well known as Josh Groban’s) and he played Clyde Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde. Even moving away from musical theater, Zac Efron has a “good guy” public image and a Disney Channel related “good guy” public image at that, and he played Ted Bundy.

 Common Complaint #3: He is an Example of Stunt-Casting:

I am not sure if this is the official definition of stunt-casting, or even if there is an official definition of stunt-casting, but in my mind I make a distinction between stunt-casting and star-casting. The way I see it, stunt-casting is when an actor or actress is put into a role when they struggle to or simply cannot sing the part. They’re given the role solely because of the box office draw. (I will not give an example for fear of sounding mean.) However, star-casting is when an actor or actress is put into a role because of the box office draw but also because they can sing the part. I don’t think there would be a single person on this earth who would say that Josh Groban cannot sing. But neither stunt or star-casting are new concepts on Broadway. Chicago is very well-known for it. Funny Girl (controversial, I know) star-casted Lea Michele as Fanny Brice. No matter your thoughts (or my thoughts) on Lea Michele’s personality, she is capable of singing the score and is drawing in quite a lot of people.

Final Thoughts: I love Josh Groban. If he doesn’t win (or isn’t at the very, very least nominated for) a Tony Award for his portrayal of Sweeney Todd, I will be heartbroken.",Popular-Spinach-7173,82,135,0.9

Great: The book is hilarious in a crass way (so so many dick jokes). The score is stylistically similar to Miranda Lambert or early Kacey Musgraves (and they love Jesus and want you to know it). The standout in the cast is Alex Newell, who got a mid-first act standing ovation. The ensemble was used brillantly (phenomal dance numbers). Three incredible Broadway debuts (*both* leading ladies + male swing). Great lighting design. And a real set that doesn't rely first and foremost on projections!!

Not so great: The character of Peanut could be cut/made smaller and a featured ensemble track. The character has so little to do. The storytellers have a point in being there (that phone conversation is brillant), but there is so much of that...that could be done in the main story and not told by them. Show will probably tighten up in general (timing was off in a couple places tonight - the corn in the backpack most evident - but first preview).

Re: Tonys. Probable noms for Newell, Book, Score, Choregraphy, possible for most/all design and direction.

The whole play was so minimalist that it looked they were saving a buck, and it was so on the nose that I'm not sure who the target audience was. It looked like it was aimed at 17 year olds that really like Jessica Chastain and this was confirmed by murmurs I heard behind me of ""wow, that is so deep/true"". The show was long, boring, the 'conflict' was so low stakes that I didn't care at all what the outcome would be. It's a story that could've been told in 25 minutes, and not 2 hours. The build up pointless, and the ending even more childish.

343,Yet another review of Bad Cinderella,11lbmoy,"No one asked for this, but I want to give my 2 cents about Bad Cinderella. I won the lottery, so I got my tickets for $30 - (amazing seat left orchestra - where a lot of the action happens when characters go in the orchestra)

Cons:

- too many ballads. There are like 3 songs that could be cut without affecting the plot. I don’t like that the characters say what they are feeling and then sing the same feeling after that. IMHO you either sing or say your feelings, not both. 

- plot wholes: (a) what happens at midnight? (b) what’s the role of the slippers? (c) what’s the role of the necklace? (d) how did the stepmother and the queen know each other? 
Dear AWL, if you’re reading this just cut out the midnight, necklace and slippers part and use this time to give us one more song about stepmother and queen. Actually, dear AWL this show can be saved just listen to all the reviews.

- underused actors: there’s a couple of actors who sing one song and then disappear. 


Pros:
- AMAZING costumes. I saw it as paying $30 to go to an amazing dress museum. The dresses for the ball are def an improvement from the west end costumes. I’m not a fan of the costumes when they sing Bad Cinderella, but aside from that 10/10. 

- AMAZING SET design! 

- some of the songs/choreographies are really high energy like man’s man. 

- I had low expectations for Linedy after listening to her version of Bad Cinderella, but she delivers in I know I have a heart because you broke it. 

- really easy to win cheap seats via lottery or digital rush. Plus, everyone around me who asked the ushers for an upgrade got it! 

If you want a story that makes sense this is not it, if you want to see nice costumes, amazing stage and some nice choreography get the $30 rush tickets.

The massive platform on the stage really limits the actors to move and interact, this should be eliminated completely. The songs are sung very quietly and understated, which is a weird quality for any Broadway show. 

The woman next to us left at intermission and my wife and I were sorely tempted to follow. We saw Bad Cinderella last weekend and found that better, for comparison. 

Maybe the tons of confederate flags got me off to an awkward start. While I’m definitely sure the confederacy has impacts on the south to this day, it was a bit of a stretch to try and illustrate a direct impact to this story.

351,A Doll’s House? More Like A Snooze Fest.,11l1n8t,"I saw the revival of A Doll's House on Broadway last week, and it did not work for me. Jamie Lloyd thought he could create a new modern commentary through the vessel of A Doll's House, but instead, it comes off as an egregious, lazy, celebrity bait table read. It added nothing to the discussion on modern feminism/gender roles. I was disconnected from the narrative because there was nothing to look at or enjoy. The edited script is jumbled, plot points are completely ignored (Nora’s suicidal ideation is mentioned lightly and then glossed over completely), and honestly, the performances were predictable and safe. There was no physicality to anything because nine times out of ten, the performers were sitting in chairs on spinning platforms (which, by the way, can we PLEASE give up spinning platforms, I am tired). I would not be surprised if production gave soundbites on the importance of no set because it was an easy fallback due to lazy direction. There were no costumes, no set, and the entire thing takes place on a blank empty stage with chairs. Laser lights blast the front of the stage and create a harsh line along the back wall, but otherwise they hold no purpose besides to close in on the talent in intense scenes. The lights from above the stage slowly descend as the play progresses, and it is, by far, the only interesting lighting choice utilized. They barely played with lighting or color tones, I had to check and make sure that a lighting designer was even attached to the project. In theory, the revival of A Doll’s House sounds like a brilliant retelling, the lack of a set “makes you think!” But instead, it’s such utter bullshit, and it’s evident that A Doll’s House only returned to Broadway because they knew they could make money off of a half-assed “avant-garde” production starring Jessica Chastain and that one guy from Succession everyone forgot about. 

It is frustrating that a production like Jamie Lloyd’s A Doll’s House would take advantage of tourists and convince them, and themselves, that their “Brechtian"" choices are profound when it was one of the laziest productions I have ever seen. I have never sat through something so boring and un-profound in my life. The way they rewrote the script made it so convoluted that multiple audience members left, and I often heard people voice their confusion out loud. Next time if I want to pay 95 dollars to watch Jessica Chastain sit on stage for 2 hours and then walk out the back freight door into the NYC street for a gag effect at the end of the play, I will sit and watch paint dry because, somehow, that would be more entertaining.",Glad-Aardvark1949,15,16,0.77
352,Advice for guiding my young thespian into adulthood,11l5vho,"I joined this sub because Broadway is one of my very favorite things in life and thought I would maybe pick up some fun or interesting facts about shows or performers and read interesting conversations about theater (which I do!) but I didn’t realize there would be actual industry folk here! Is it appropriate for me, as a mother of a young performer, to ask for advice from this community? To be more specific, I’m wondering what advice you have for a parent who wants to support their aspiring performer to reach her goal of Broadway? Pitfalls to avoid? My 13 year old is very active in her local community theater company and has had a passion for theater from a very young age. Most people don’t get to turn their passion into a living and that’s okay. I don’t know if this will be her forever path but I want to do what I can to  facilitate it since she seems to love it so much and has a fair amount of natural talent. It’s an infamously tough business, so I worry about pigeonholing her into a performance-based skill set without the security of other complimentary skills (business, education, etc).

362,Phantom of the Opera - have there been any updates from the Redditors who wanted to do special occasions?,11kis66,"I saw the full production of Phantom of the Opera on Broadway on Saturday evening for the first and last time, and afterwards I couldn't stop thinking about the 2 separate Redditors who posted in 2022 about wanting to see Phantom of the Opera before it closes. Does anyone know if we have any updates or remember who they are so maybe we can reach out and ask? The 2 are:  
1) The woman whose teenager daughter desperately wanted to see Phantom (and saved up her own money from working summer jobs) and the sub originally all said Phantom would never close, only to all eat our words a few weeks later with the shock closing announcement. I remember the woman posted around the time of the closing extension saying that they were doing to somehow make it to the show in 2023, but have they gone yet? Are they going soon?   
2) The man who wanted to propose to his girlfriend at the Phantom of the Opera, either before or after the show at/near the theater. I believe most of the sub talked him out of proposing in the theater, but did they go see the show? Did he propose?   


My own thoughts on the show - I loved every second of it! The dramatic music, the gorgeous costumes, the stage magic - the lushness of the entire set - all of it was what I wanted to see and experience and I got it. I was sitting in the front mezz, and that meant great views of the chandelier going up and down, full views of the lake scenes, and >!when the Phantom pops up in the proscenium. !< And now that I've seen Emilie Kouatchou in the role I'm having such a hard time imagining someone else playing Christine Daae on the stage, although there is no doubt that Sarah Brightman is/was *\*the\** voice of Christine. Greg Mills was in the role of Raoul for the evening. I'm in awe of all the primary actors and actresses for Phantom of the Opera because these are such vocally demanding roles.

I'm basically the same age as the Broadway production, give or take a couple weeks, so I've grown up with listening to the Broadway OBC recording first on cassette then on CDs. Would listen to the CD all the time with my sibling growing up. While I don't have the voice for singing any of the songs, I know all the lyrics by heart and there's nothing like the overture for sheer drama. I swear I've seen a bootleg VHS of a stage production before the 2004 film came out, though the details are extremely fuzzy by now. Other than the Disney films, Phantom of the Opera and Cats were definitely the first musicals I encountered as a kid, and obviously one of those stuck with me throughout the decades and the other did not.   


The only downside is the cramped Majestic Theater. I'm about 5'3"" and my knees were touching the seat in front of me on the front mezz. The theater is showing its age and after 35 years of heavy use it definitely is in need of serious renovations.",morlinde,2,35,0.93

But then once I was like ""That's Spongebob!"" I immediately stopped looking forward to it, because there is NO WAY that it has the amazing costumes and sets of Spongebob, so it would just be Spongebob but not nearly as good.

375,Sweeney Todd Advice,11kj7bn,"My sister and I try to go to NYC to watch three Broadway shows about twice a year. We are likely going to go sometime this spring and then maybe again in the late fall.

Sweeney Todd is one of my all-time favorite shows, and I would love if we went to watch it this upcoming trip. However, and I need not tell anyone this, the tickets are very pricey. We usually pay between $125 to $150 per ticket, and always end up sitting in the orchestra. The tickets I’ve seen for Sweeney for a spring weekend (my sister can only go over a weekend) are over $200 for the back of the mezzanine.

So I guess my question is – should we bite the bullet, and go in May or so and pay the exuberant prices, or should we wait for the next time we go in the late fall? It doesn’t look like this is a limited engagement, but I may be wrong. Though perhaps after the Tony’s, prices will increase again.

Also another point – my friend got me a $100 gift certificate for [Broadway.com](https://Broadway.com) for my birthday (I know it’s a scam, but I didn’t have the heart to tell her after she gifted it to me), so after the site eats up about half of that for transactional fees, maybe we will be left with another $25 off per ticket or something? I don’t know if that is a point in favor of just going this spring.

376,Are cross-country tours usually significantly worse than the original Broadway production?,11k6p9n,"I know some things will take a hit, but I was pretty disappointed all around with Legally Blonde.  We watched in Lubbock, TX.  It seemed like the entire cast except for the ones playing Paulette and Warner were amateurs or just a really poor fit.  The male lead looked like he was 40-years old and overweight, which is weird because if I google the actor he looks like a 20-something hot dude, but it was weird watching him hit on a law student while admonishing his professor for doing the same.  The lead also had the worst wig possible.  There's a line where they describe her enemy as having ""flat"" hair and shoes, but the wig the lead wore the whole time was as flat and straight as possible, and given the importance of hair for Legally *Blonde*, you'd think they'd do a better job.  And it also seems as if the actress is blonde herself, so not sure why they used a wig at all.

They also had a screen in the background that would display bits of the scenery or content.  Sometimes it worked well, like showing what people are texting or a TikTok video, but sometimes it was just really weird and amateurish.  Like they literally had Microsoft WordArt saying ""ELLE WOODS"" going across the screen when she was singing, ""Is that my name up on that list?""  I get that it was probably a compromise because they couldn't have a full stage like in larger markets, but it would have been better to just not have it for a lot of the stuff, rather than use it in such a cheesy manner.

And the acting choices overall were weird.  Warner and Paulette played it serious, but almost everyone else seemed like they were doing a parody of the musical.  It's a funny show, sure, but the characters are supposed to be real and it always felt like the cast was too in on the joke and wanted the audience to know.

Anyway, is this a unique situation or commonplace when touring?  I imagine larger market tours like LA or Seattle would be better.  Does it suffer more when the tour hits small venues all around the country or what?  Is it just harder to get better talent?  And I understand the production quality will suffer with a lot of venues being smaller and overall budgets likely being much lower.  Also, this show is like 10+ years old, so perhaps that's part of the issue too.",punchheadkick,60,15,0.71

396,Some Like It Hot is PHENOMENAL,11j3ns7,"Why aren't more people talking about it/seeing it? I've seen this three times; once during previews, another on opening night, and last week. I was surprised at how entertaining it was considering I'd only come to see Christian, but I was blown away nonetheless. It's a show in the same vein as 42nd street and brings back the nostalgia of old musicals from the 30s and 40s. This is a dying genre these days, and seeing so many empty seats breaks my heart. I was thoroughly amused the entire time and captivated by the music and choreography. I really hope that you take the time to consider at least seeing it! The cast and creative team have worked FAR too hard for this to close early. They at least deserve a return on the investment, and I really mean that. I prefer contemporary and experimental shows myself, but I really appreciated this. It was incredibly nostalgic and enjoyable. It has pretty revered reviews as well, so I'm shocked at the lack of attention it's getting ( I wish the marketing team was doing more :p )

401,Exciting Uses of Puppetry,11jjl6g,"Weird start, but ever since I visited La Mama Theater's Jumpstart last year and Puppet Slam this year, I've been newly entrenched in the world of effective puppetry in serious theater. I get teased by my friends about it like I'm that guy from *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, but! Ironically, part of what I love about it is that puppets allow plays to take stupid things seriously and serious things stupidly. Puppets, generally considered 'kids stuff', really test you on theater's rule to suspend your disbelief. It also allows a meta performance when they stop using the puppet or when the actor controlling them makes a reactive/emotive choice--kinda like what I guess 'I want' soliloquy songs do in musicals. Sometimes, you get to get gorey and disgusting and full-out in a way that would be distasteful otherwise. Or you get to be quiet. You get to really look the audience in the eye and go, this really is just a story, huh? But you're really connecting to this puppet. And it's just fun! Visual treats for the eyes. I'm already biased to craft and sculpture, so it's already a pro for me. Scale becomes even more important and exciting to play in.

Some of my favorites in recent memory are all off-Broadway but: for really playful and diverse puppetry, I LOVED the preview of The Healing Shipment by Maricama and its lovely, weirdo sci-fi way of exploring generations. Others that also give that + narrative-structure-breaking fun, I loved Wakka Wakka's *Immortal Jellyfish Girl*, and, recently, the version of Hansol Jung's *Wolf Play* by Soho Rep at MCC Theater. It's cool because these plays made me realize that the designs can either be exaggerated to paint the characterizations for the back of the theater, or really bare bones, to allow you even more projection onto the character.

I've also only heard good things about *Life of Pi* (and I enjoyed the novel when I read it in school, so might have to watch), and I watched *Lion King* on Broadway years ago. And I saw *Avenue Q* back when I was young enough to think the *Internet is for Porn* was the height of edgy comedy.

What are some examples of exciting puppetry in theater that you've seen in Broadway and off-Broadway? I know the Jim Henson foundation supports a lot of excellent puppetry (shadow, cardboard, paper, plush, installation, etc), so there's definitely a lot I don't know about.",dandanicaica,46,10,0.92

(It reminds me of two other Off Broadway plays from last year - A Case for the Existence of God, for thematic and emotional content, and You Will Get Sick, for its abstract aspects and set, and again for all the emotions).

408,Hadestown and light sensitivity or dizziness?,11jf7a2,"Hi, folks! I saw Hadestown on Broadway and loved it so much I insisted on taking my family to see it when it toured locally. I’ll spare you my rambling thoughts on the differences between the two, but my experience was wildly different in one way that I’m curious if anyone else has dealt with:

If you know the show, you know they do some freaky stuff with lights: swinging spotlights, hanging lights, head lamps, lights dimming and brightening and flashing…it’s heady and amazing, and didn’t bother me at all the first time I saw the show. But yesterday, as soon as I got home to my dark apartment, everything started spinning; I couldn’t keep my eyes open, let alone focus on anything, the world went in crazy loops whenever I made the mistake of moving my head, and I was afraid to stand in case I took a header into the ground or furniture. It lasted for hours, slowly fading to something resembling normal. My mom was a little queasy from the lights, while my dad, brother, and friend had no negative symptoms. There’s something called flicker vertigo that mayyyybe could’ve been caused by the show, or fluorescent lighting poisoning (both of which sound super serious and borderline melodramatic to write out), and there could be a whole host of reasons as to why the Broadway version didn’t bother me: I was seated on the ground floor instead of the balcony so the lights were more direct, how much I’d eaten/drank/slept before the show, maybe the lights are just more hardcore on the touring version, maybe it just wasn’t my afternoon.

I’ve seen conversations related to several productions about actors both notorious for poor attendance in shows, as well as actors who have very good attendance records. my question: numbers-wise, what is considered good vs. poor attendance?

from my perspective, Broadway seems so vocally demanding with 7-8 shows per week that regular absences would be expected to recuperate (though I do understand it’s the actors’ jobs and their responsibility to keep their voice healthy). with Covid, I feel like it’s also more widely accepted for actors to unexpectedly miss because it’s so transmissible and unpredictable. 

basically, where is the line between “good” and “bad” attendance? if an actor calls out for a show a week, is that normal? and at what point would people consider an actor to be calling out too much or developing a “reputation” for lack of a better word? is attendance perceived differently than when an actor has a scheduled absence (I.e.

444,Help me pick 2 out of 3!,11hg1j5,"My husband and I are visiting NYC in August, and we’d like to see two Broadway shows while we’re there. 

We’re considering between these three: Funny Girl (just extended to Sept!), Sweeney Todd, and Parade. 

I wish we could see them all. But we really can only afford to go to two and it’s unlikely we’d make it back to the city in a year or so. My fear is that by then — it’s possible that those shows could close and then I’d miss out on something truly spectacular. 

I used to work as a stage manager in NYC, and I still love live theatre very much. I’ve seen many shows on Broadway, and in regional theatres around the country and abroad. I also went to a performing arts high school and college. Because of all this, I tend to have preferences to shows I know well. 

In this case, I’m leaning towards Sweeney Todd, which was one of the fundamental productions of my time in school.
 
Funny Girl sounds fun because the film is so wonderful and everyone says Lea Michele is incredible. 

Parade is rather unknown to me, though I do like JRB and I think shows that fight antisemitism are very important. 

All of that is to say that I cannot seem to decide which two shows would be best! My husband is very lovingly just along for the ride here, so he has no preference.

450,Last minute Broadway trip help,11hh6m0,"Yesterday I bit the bullet and bought a last minute flight to NYC, getting in Tuesday night (3/7) and leaving early Sunday morning (3/12). Most did this to see PARADE, which I've already bought tickets for for Friday night and to get out of my house for a few days (I work from home). Now I'm thinking about what to do for the other nights I'm in town, and I'm at a loss for what to see. Here are the options I've been mulling over:

PETER PAN GOES WRONG - I've seen The Play That Goes Wrong twice and really enjoyed myself both times, and I'd love to see this show with the original British cast rather than on tour. 

FUNNY GIRL - I'm not really a huge fan of the actual show itself, but from what I've heard Lea Michele is so good it's not to be missed. As much as I'd love to see her, she's out the entire week I'm in town except for Wednesday, when prices are way of my range. I was hoping to stay around $100 for each show, but the cheapest I see for Wednesday is $200. Is it worth it for the extra hundred? 

I would try to rush, but I will be working from the hotel in the day and thus will be unable to do it in-person, which leaves my options for cheaper shows pretty bleak.

KIMBERLY AKIMBO - I honestly had no intentions of seeing this show until all the great word of mouth came about. Now I'm wondering if this small show is worth seeing in NYC or if it will tour so I can see it then. It doesn't quite seem like my sort of thing, but I'm willing to give anything a chance!

SHUCKED - I'm intrigued! Plus tickets are cheap, and who knows if this will ever get out of NYC? A bit of a gamble, though, since I'll be seeing it the week previews start and thus can't really gauge any reactions until the tickets are bought.

MOULIN ROUGE - Generally I'm not a big fan of jukebox musicals, but I do love the movie and would be interested in seeing Tveit.

LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS - I've heard great things about this production, but I did Little Shop in high school and at this point know every word and don't particularly care to see the show again. I would buy tickets if it seems to be worth it, though, and I would like to Maude Apatow as I loved her in Euphoria.

Those are the big ones I'm considering, but if anyone else has suggestions I'd be more than happy to hear them. I'm really not looking to see any jukebox shows like & Juliet, MJ, or A Beautiful Noise.",emccaughey,21,6,0.88

459,Bob Fosse’s Dancin’ first preview thoughts!,11gqonf,"Just got back from the first preview of Dancin’ on Broadway! If you’re going into this expecting a story, lots of singing, and characters, you’re in for the wrong show. It’s a showcase of the choreography and style of Bob Fosse through a variety of high-energy dance numbers. 

Everyone in the cast is amazing! All top-tier professional dancers and was amazed the entire time! There are several solos throughout so many of the dancers get their moment to shine and show off!

The music, while mostly instrumental, is for the most part, really good! Thankfully, the ballad-like numbers were few and far between and everything felt like such a high energy dance number! The music had us dancing a bit in our seats and had a lot of jazz and 20s high energy musical vibes.

The set was minimal but there’s a big projector screen in the back that gets used a lot.

Overall, I really enjoyed it and would recommend others to see it! I prob wouldn’t go again but it’s a really fun initial experience!

Edit: I will also say, the show starts off a little strange and made me nervous that this was gonna be like a college dance troupe recital, but it ramps up after like 15-20 minutes.",kwhiggs8,11,48,0.99

I've seen a local production of Little Shop and enjoyed it, and I saw the tour of Chicago this year and thought it was okay, but I've heard that the Broadway production is better.

465,Seeking guidance about buying Kimberly Akimbo tickets,11h5q64,"I'm going to New York from March 17-20 for the first time since before the pandemic and I am so stoked to have the time and means to see three shows. On Friday night I'll be seeing a musical through Broadway Roulette, Saturday matinee I'll be seeing Leopoldstadt and for the third show I'm pretty sure I'd like to see Kimberly Akimbo, except that I'm not sure if that's what the Broadway Roulette show will end up being. My questions:

A. Should I go ahead and buy Kimberly Akimbo tickets anyway or is there a pretty good chance that I'll get it through Broadway Roulette? My guess based on current ticket prices and what I crossed out is that I'll most likely end up with either Shucked (which I am kind of curious about) or Bad Cinderella (which I wish I did cross out, but now it's too late) but I know the chance is far from zero.

B. If I wait until the day before or the day of, is there a good chance that I can get relatively inexpensive tickets through TDF or TodayTix? I keep tracking TDF but so far I've only seen tickets for weekdays on it. I know TKTS is also an option, but I don't really want to venture to Times Square or Lincoln Center early-ish on Saturday morning. Are there usually good seats for Kimberly Akimbo left on TKTS around 1 PM on Saturday for the evening performance? If so, I can just go on my way to Leopoldstadt. 

C. Should I try to rush it? I feel like I'm too old and crockety to wait in a rush line, but if there are tickets left throughout the day I would consider it.",ar417,10,3,0.8
466,"Is Broadway ""family friendly""?",11i77dt,"Now wait. I know what you're thinking. What kind of question is that? Of course! There is The Lion King, Aladdin, and so many other shows that families can enjoy. In fact, as a toddler, my first show was The Lion King. But as Anything Goes has stated ""Times have changed"" and Broadway has evolved. And in a lot of aspects, evolved for the better. However, as I was looking at tickets to find a show to see, I realized, as I looked at a lot of the shows that I would want to see, my usual Broadway partner, my grandmother won't enjoy it. 

I had this realization when I went to see Company before it closed. I mainly went to see Patti LuPone as it was a bucket list of mine and I went by myself because well I needed me time. But anyway, I went and I loved the show, I told my family I loved the show, but my grandmother was like, well next time you see a show, invite me, I feel left out. Now if she said this to me before I saw the show, I would have felt bad, but after seeing it, I was like, oh no, you would not have enjoyed the show and I wouldn't have been able to enjoy the show. Why?

Weed/Getting High/Smoking, unnecessary swearing, and displays of a homosexual relationship. 

With the scene before ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy"", I ate it up because I eat edibles (my grandmother doesn't know) and I was able to relate to my first time. I was crying from laughing. Swearing doesn't bother me. And I loved Paul and Jaime. Their scene was so tough to watch and I felt so emotional and when Jaime shouted ""I'm the next bride!"" I cheered like the rest of the audience. My grandmother would not and if she were there in order to avoid confrontation, I would have to keep my excitement to myself.

All of that to say, a lot of these modern productions are being very progressive which is fantastic but for people like my grandmother, who introduced me to Broadway, I feel like I won't be able to enjoy a show with her without her complaining about how they are ""highlighting gay people"" or something else offensive. Like I've always wanted to see Chicago, and my grandmother hated even the movie because it was too raunchy. Imagine me going, ""Hey, wanna see Chicago with a drag queen as Mama?"". She would double flip.

So I guess, I wrote this post wondering, has anyone else gone through this? Like I have no problem seeing a show by myself, believe me. But also, I enjoyed seeing shows with my grandmother but it's the Christian pearl clutching that gets me. The snide remarks. Maybe Broadway isn't for her anymore. Unless it's a revival of an older show or maybe a Disney production I can't see really enjoying Broadway with my grandmother or family (my aunt and mom also make homophobic comments) anymore.

Edit: I guess Im just a shit titler lol. And a shit venter. But anyway. My point was, Broadway is changing. My grandmother doesnt like it. I want to enjoy broadway with my grandmother. Now I cant because she is conservative. Does anyone else deal with family members who complain about broadway not being ""family friendly"" as in ""coddling to conservatives"". Not why cant Broadway be more accepting to my grandmother. Does that make sense?

I am not agreeing with my grandmother here. Hence why ""family friendly"" is in quotes.

Edit 2: I apologize for being dumb and offending people with my post. I didn't realize it would be so hurtful when really I was just venting about how I dont like my grandmother's views but I enjoyed broadway with her and it's hard to seperate comfort and shit like that. So again, I sincerely apologize. I didn't mean to offend. I love broadway and I wont stop loving broadway, but I dont like hurting people which I seem to do a lot because my words are dumb and hurtful. So if anyone read this far, again Im sorry.",GizmaAzara,129,0,0.25
467,Help me pick a show for my mom who doesn't speak English?,11gqwqj,"I live in NYC and my mom is visiting in April. She doesn't speak any English but I want her to have a Broadway experience, as she does like music and shows (... and also bragging to friends her daughter took her, haha).  I think something with very little talking and a lot of spectacle would fit the bill. I made a shortlist, but then I had a hard time deciding, especially since some of the choices I've never seen myself. Which would you vote for?  Are there any choices I'm forgetting?

**Some Like It Hot**  \- I've seen this one! The spectacle & dancing are great, but I actually think there might be too much talking in it? Am I misremembering? I also feel like the plot might be too difficult to understand too if you don't understand the dialogue vs say, Moulin Rouge. 

**Moulin Rouge** \- I've seen this one (but with Ashley & Aaron, I assume it'll be fun to see it again with Derek & Oyoyo). The singing's insane and the music's nonstop. I think she'll get the girl torn between rich boy and poor boy story from just blocking and costume. But it might not be very fun not knowing the songs...?

**&Juliet** \- I haven't been to this one! Another jukebox, I heard it's very fun and wholesome which she should be into. Could anyone tell me what the ratio between music & dialogue is, and how comprehensible the story is for a non-Eng speaker?

**Phantom of the Opera -** I was thinking of taking her just for the brand name, not going to lie. Ithink she'll enjoy the music + chandelier most, but I vaguely remember from the off-broadway production I saw there being quite a lot of dialogue. 

**MJ -** Not been to this one! People talk about the dancing and costumes a lot but how is the singing?

**Aladdin** \- This one I can show her the animated movie with subtitles and then have her go see. I've heard it's got great sets, is that true? It's for families so I assume less dialogue. 

**Funny Girl -** Honestly, I want to shell out myself to see it and I figure she'll get to say she went to the hottest ticket in town and get the most topnotch singing Broadway has to offer. And the photos of the stage & costumes I've seen actually look pretty good, but I don't know about the dialogue to songs ratio. The movie has a lot of dialogue so if it's that much I might avoid.  

Right now, I'm leaning towards **&Juliet** or **Phantom of the Opera**!

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your insightful thoughts, I'm going to go with Phantom and Moulin Rouge if I can't swing Phantom tickets!

488,Sweeney Preview Review,11fv9ws,"Had a chance to see Sweeney Todd tonight and we were left with mixed feelings. 

I went into it with an open mind, realizing that it is a preview and there may be kinks still working themselves out. 

First, Annaleigh is fabulous. Worth the admission just for her Lovett. She was hilarious and created a beautifully dynamic character. Didn’t know what to expect from her, since I’m not familiar with her work, and we were blown away. 

Josh was a subtle Todd who descended into madness. His vocals were exceptional. Seemed in his element on stage. 

Gaten was likable as Toby. Decent performance from him as well. 

Maria’s Johanna was well played and she’s a talented soprano. I suspect we will see big things from her in the future. 

Pirelli, Turpin, and Beadle (so funny) were also very good. 

Orchestra was incredible. 

I can’t remember anything else super positive because it is all overshadowed by the bizarre choreography. Another theatergoer summed it up by saying it was “embarrassingly bad.” Part Thriller Dance, part Ballroom Dancing Ghosts. At times they did this heavy breathing puffed out chest thing where they’d simultaneously roll back their shoulders. It got to the point that we’d dread the ensemble coming back on stage. It didn’t seem to lend anything to the story and was so awkward that we were all secondhand embarrassed for them. 

A shame, truly. 

The only other comment I’ll add is that some of the accents just need to go. But I didn’t find them as horribly distracting as the “dancing.”

For those who have seen the show, what option would you recommend? And what side is best, left or right? 

I don’t really have a strong preference for this show to be super close but I also love Ramin so wouldn’t mind the close-up view and it’s always a great experience to sit so close.

Moulin Rouge sounds most up my street as it's an easy watch with music I will probably know (I don't enjoy musicals unless I know the songs e.g. Les Miserables). It's about $90 with a discount code on SeatGeek. But then Moulin Rouge isn't exclusive to NYC which makes it less compelling.

Cinderella isn’t *bad* persay, she’s just bad at being *Cinderella* the same way Hillary and Selena were. 

If you like having fun at the theatre, go see it. Linedy (Cinderella) is great. The opening number sets the scene in perfect Broadway fashion. The stepmother and queen sing a fantastic duet that’s going to be well-covered. There’s one number with a full stage of shirtless men that made me blush (and question my workout routine!). It’s a fun show for people that want to go to the theatre and turn their brains off and be entertained.

&#x200B;

Phantom of the Opera- I really enjoyed this one, especially the crazy designs in about every scene with the sets and all the effects but I felt like half of the score was pretty mediocre with some good songs in there and the storyline was very meh for the first act. I found the second act a huge improvement when the characters plot to catch the Phantom and the music was a bit better. Still, it didn’t seem to have a strong moral of theme at the end of it just a horrible person escaping? Overall it was a super enjoyable show and definitely glad I saw this huge mega version of it because the sets and design is just stunning, just a bit meh on the actual book and music

Best Song: Overture/ The Phantom of the Opera

&#x200B;

Lion King- Everything in this one was about as perfect as you could make it. The staging was incredibly creative and although not as “big” as Phantom it was a much better stage picture. The look was simply amazing and it was very cool how they incorporated the African Cultural music along with the main Disney songs. The story of Lion King is very simple but the staging just really brings out the simplistic beauty of the story and theme of accepting responsibility for the past and future. I feel like it really just worked as a whole very well and might be my favorite show I’ve seen on Broadway with Hadestown/Hamilton. The sets are absolutely stunning and perfect.  


Best Song: Endless Night

&#x200B;

Hercules- This one was really fun. It’s the polar opposite approach to doing a Greek myth on stage than Hadestown but it works really well for Herc! Definitely interesting to see one of the first few performances of this too (it’s a new Disney Theatrical Show and this is the first ever production of it in the world and it has a one month run at the Paper Mill Playhouse). Very Disney as a musical but one of the better Disney books/storylines (easily better than The Little Mermaid book). The sets were absolutely amazing as well as the costumes, the production quality was breathtaking (especially for a regional theatre). The music was hit or miss but a lot of it was really good, some of the new songs were very meh though. I’m really excited to see the future of this show though because it has a lot of potential and the cast was superb in it. 

Best Song: Great Bolts of Thunder

The acting was good! 
The themes were interesting, but felt dated.

It's not that this production of Into the Woods was in any way bad, and I knew going in it'd be concert-style from lurking on this subreddit, it just felt a little lacking compared to the Signature Theater (VA) production I saw a few weeks ago. Milky White was the highlight of the show, but other than that I felt like some magic was missing for me. 

I'm not quite sure why, although maybe it was I was sitting in one of the nosebleed seats in Balcony 2 compared to front row seats at the Sig or it was because I didn't quite feel the chemistry coming from Jason Forbach who was filling in for Sebastian Arcelus. (I did know Sebastian was going to be out for this first weekend due to injury, but not when I bought this ticket a couple months ago.)

My main disappointment as of now, is that he doesn't really evoke the physical characteristics of Marty. In the London production, we had Olly Dobson, who was perfect in the role. I mean, the production team really were lucky finding a guy so similar to Michael J Fox in terms of looks. From the same hair colour and style, smaller stature like Marty and the facial features, it felt like a faithful embodying of Marty. 

I just think, considering Broadway had access to way more actors to choose from, they might have also tried to evoke Marty in a more faithful, authentic physical way. Again, recreating the spirit of Marty is what counts, but it's just something that surprised me.",rabseywomp45,29,0,0.29

532,Spoilery review of Sweeney 1st preview (adapted from the notes I typed up immediately after the performance last night in the Starbucks across from the Lyceum),11domij,"**IN GENERAL:**

* This is the dancingest damn production of this show I’ve ever seen. Lots of stiff right-angled hand and arm movements and stumbling (on purpose!).
* Definitely very firmly back in the 1840s setting, and more historically so than most versions . Excellent period costuming. Some nods back to Franne Lee but they’re just that- nods.
* No factory whistle, surprisingly. I've been told this may have been a sound system error that will be corrected in future performances.
* Cut: Judge’s Johanna (Mea Culpa), Beggar Woman’s Lullaby (though the replacement they came up with was HAUNTING), tooth-pulling
* I noticed they used the movie lyrics (""To shave-a da face, to cut-a da hair"" instead of ""to pull-a da toot'"") to Pirelli's part of the contest, probably to eliminate the tooth-pulling reference.
* Differently industrial set- sort of a tunnel-shaped proscenium, iron walkway/bridge that is lowered for most of the show to be various upper levels, and a crane downstage left that turns to suggest different things/provide stairs
* Bonus incidental/scene change music in a few places
* A major thing with both Todd and Lovett is a sense that they’re normal people who keep making little compromises, little choices, that snowball them into depravity. Neither of them are insane. Neither are sociopaths. They just keep making darker and darker decisions. Neither of them seem to be enjoying the trip (including her), but you’d be amazed what love can make you justify.
* Lots of STRONG silhouette work.

**SWEENEY (JOSH GROBAN)**

* GOOD LORD
* He’s good. He’s REALLY good. I don’t know if this counts as stunt casting at this point because this is the most thoughtfully interrogated Sweeney I’ve ever seen. I did not come into this as a major Groban stan or anything and he blew me away.
* Incredibly skilled at conveying that this is the wreckage of a normal person. Most Sweeneys are varying degrees of turned to stone with an aching center. His comes off like he’s a walking scabbed-over burn and just moving, existing, is cracking it in new places and making him hurt again and again. His vengeance being ruined toward the end of the first act makes him drop to his knees and cling to his chair like he can’t stay upright. Beseeching.
* He is essentially and unignorably still Benjamin Barker. That’s the most harrowing part. He still has an exuberant sense of humor in act 1- his subdued demeanor in act 2 clearly comes from the psychological injury he’s doing to himself on top of what’s been done to him. You can see that he was once a loving husband, a father who probably made faces at his baby daughter. Life smashed him over its knee and here’s what’s left. He’s fearful, neurotic, tries not to show it.
* When he tells Lovett to send Toby up for disposal after killing Pirelli, he sounds tired and resigned, not menacing.
* Laughs in relief when Toby moves to kill him.

**LOVETT (ANNALEIGH ASHFORD)**

* Tiny, outwardly demure (except toward Sweeney), probably all of 35. Fascinating to see what this does with the character. Hard not to imagine her as having been married in her teens to a gross old man (hm) and focusing on her handsome upstairs neighbor/feeling like she’d be better than that little twit he married, even back then.
* CLEARLY makes the decision to tell him Lucy killed herself on the spot because she sees an opening.
* They kept the space buns!
* Fantastic at physical comedy (too many examples to list here)
* Notably has to turn on the bubbliness during God That’s Good- the song begins with her sitting on the stairs tiredly counting her money during Toby’s spiel. She doesn’t come off as greedy then- more like she’s reminding herself of the money to ease the way her conscience is screaming at her. She very noticeably bucks herself up to go in and serve the customers.
* Pets Toby’s hair to keep him from noticing she’s crying at the end of Not While I’m Around. She doesn’t *want* to have to get rid of him. It breaks her heart, very obviously. But there she goes, locking him in the bakehouse.
* Sobbing by the time her whole lie is revealed, knows damned well he’s going to kill her, doesn’t even scream as he throws her in, just lets out one more sob.
* Bangs her fists on the ground and collapses on “I’d be twice the wife she was”

**TOBY (GATEN MATARAZZO)**

* His voice is still kind of a WIP but I think some of that was also him acting- he sounded more sure of himself on the bigger notes, which inclines me toward thinking a lot of this was for effect.
* This is a Toby with probably a mild learning disorder or something at most. He stammers sometimes but the rest is so clearly just trauma making him subservient and timid.
* Obviously in love with Mrs. Lovett. I honestly thought he was going to try to kiss her. Did not come off as creepy. He’s too innocent for that. Also not particularly oedipal despite the “mum” thing considering they register as like 20 years apart at most.
* Doesn’t play the end like a conventional mad scene. He seems almost like his mind is just perma-locked on what normalcy he last focused on. I didn’t get the feeling that this was Toby’s transformation into a deranged killer. He’s very calm and righteous about killing Sweeney. Presumably in whatever asylum the poor kid ends up in, he’ll probably be a very sad model inmate. He doesn’t have much fight in him. Heartbreaking.

**ANTHONY (JORDAN FISHER)**

* Tbh he doesn’t distinguish himself super hard but I’d like to come back after opening night to see if he’s clarified himself a little more. Accent is a little wobbly.
* Does a great job at delivering some of Anthony’s sillier dialogue in a way that makes it sound like a way humans actually talk, though.
* A little overwhelmed by the depth of some of the notes, but tbh I doubt a lot of other people are as dedicated to the whole “did you know Anthony is actually a baritone?” thing as I am
* Clearly a civilian sailor, not in the Royal Navy like the original costume implied. (I think if Fisher can't work out the accent it's probably fine if he just lets him be American. Anthony can be American. He's been all over the place. Maybe London just feels like home because it's his favorite.)
* Leans into the dorkiness- he struggled a bit with getting the bird he bought for Johanna off the rack and turned it into a cute character moment

**JOHANNA (MARIA BILBAO)**

* Tbh this production isn’t really blazing any new Johanna territory but that isn’t her fault
* I expect she’ll also clarify her a little over time, but this was LITERALLY the first time Maria Bilbao’s ever performed on Broadway. Literally her first performance. I expect there were nerves, and looking at her bio and prior roles. I honestly suspect some of it is that she’s not used to acting while also using her legit voice (which is harder than acting while belting, and most of her previous roles are belter parts). She was visibly better every time she was just doing dialogue.
* They gave her a really lovely honey-colored wig that made the blondeness work.
* I think she was also the young Lucy double during Poor Thing in her opening/ensemble wig, so she’s a terrific dancer.

**BEGGAR WOMAN (RUTHIE ANN MILES)**

* oh god she was absolutely heartbreaking
* She also made her Scottish, which is a cute touch (and imo probably added another awful irony to Sweeney not looking at her- his Lucy was Scottish, etc, etc, a painful reminder already, oh god)
* The restaging of her entering the barbershop in the climax was WRENCHING. Probably the best way of telling the audience who is I've ever seen.
* At one point a man spit on her instead of giving her a coin and she just mumbled “thank you, sir” and something in me broke

**JUDGE TURPIN (JAMIE JACKSON)**

* This is one of many Sweeneys that just doesn’t do much with Turpin. I thought maybe it was Jackson at first. It wasn’t. This is the most pervasive flaw across stagings of this show I've seen, though, so I can't really point to it as a particular problem in this one. It's not even a matter of ""well, they didn't include the Mea Culpa scene, so of course he loses something""; I saw a production once with that sequence that nevertheless had a complete nonentity of a Turpin. It's a solvable problem (and the movie of all things probably solved it best of all- Alan Rickman is *panic-inducingly* scary in that one), but it's one that's so rarely solved that singling this one out for not doing so feels unfair.
* His character voice is excellent, though. He probably could have done a really chilling Mea Culpa.

**BEADLE BAMFORD (JOHN RAPSON)**

* Absolute standout among the secondary roles. 
* Incredibly funny while also being loathsome
* The most normal-looking Beadle I’ve ever seen- actually rather handsome in a muttonchoppy 1840s way. This just added to the greasiness, surprisingly.
* Does the most drawling, lisping (not in a campy way, in an Insufferable Englishman way) voice. It’s kind of astonishing. 
* Found a few laugh lines I’ve never heard delivered as such before, though with some very grim subtext to a few of them (""That's the sort of scallywag that's putting this neighborhood in disrepute!"" or whatever the line is specifically).

**PIRELLI (NICHOLAS CHRISTOPHER)**

* Another standout. All hip thrusts and big gestures.
* His Pirelli accent travels through so many different countries that it really adds something to the fraud aspect. I assume this was intentional.
* Doesn’t play the Irish reveal for comedy beyond the initial shock of it.
* I would love to catch a performance with him as Sweeney.",nosleeptilmanhattan,85,393,0.98

554,My review of Bad Cinderella: it’s just MEAN,11d27k2,"Like in all seriousness, there were a few (a VERY FEW) positives to this show, mainly Sebastian’s singing and the set design. But this show will never be so bad it’s good because the entire plot is just based on everyone being catty and awful to each other so the snarky/sassy bits just don’t come off as funny, just an awkward Karen fight at a party. 

The show itself can’t decide of Cinderella is happy being “not like other girls” (don’t even get me started on that trope) or wants to be pretty and well-liked. The actress didn’t seem to have any idea either. 

The stepmother and queen hate each other for some incredibly vague reason. It’s like a Chekhov’s gun that never actually fires. 

All the townspeople hate Sebastian for being “ugly” when the actor by absolutely no means is unattractive, even compared to Prince Charming. 

Wtf was up with the incest subtext? And why did Charming have to come back except to help make the plot last 30 more minutes?

I’ve seen some real stinkers (King Kong, Diana, Lord of the Rings) but this is honestly the worst professionally produced musical I’ve ever experienced. There was no joy to be had, the plot felt like it went nowhere and didn’t understand its characters. Almost every joke fell flat, and when Cinderella calls her stepmother a b*tch the audience seemed more like it was trying to figure out where it came from. There was a much better reaction to stepmother saying it also came naturally. (It should also be said Carolee Carmello truly tried her best in this unforgivingly bad role)

And just everything around that hideous dress was a weird choice. How do you do a Cinderella show that doesn’t even get an acknowledgement from the audience when the dress happens? A big budget show like this should have gasps and applause and instead the mad scientist Godmother just does it in the background. If they wanted a big reveal have it be in the shadows at the end of act 1 and big reveal at the ball. It would still be an ugly dress but at least there would be some feeling of intentionality at that point. 

The whole show just felt like ideas that went nowhere and ALW trying to appeal to his perception of the trendiest girls of 2004. This one won’t be a Carrie or Diana, it’ll be the final nail in his coffin.",rfg217phs,70,136,0.95

557,Sweeney Todd revival first preview thoughts,11czxan,"Summary: A straightforward take with good performances that doesn’t skimp on production value. Had some minor issues that should be smoothed out after a few weeks of performances, so if you don’t have tickets yet I’d wait a bit rather than trying to go ASAP.

Favorite Parts:

-Annaleigh Ashford is a hilarious (and very horny!) Mrs. Lovett, I’m pretty sure Josh broke at one point during A Little Priest and he must have been fighting for his life to not laugh during By The Sea.

-Gaten Matarazzo is perfect as Toby, worked out best for everyone that he ended up doing this over the Parade transfer because he was a much better fit for it than playing Frankie.

-John Rapson stole every scene as Beadle Bamford, though not a huge surprise since IIRC he’s been playing the role for ages in various productions.

-It’s truly a thrill to get to hear the gorgeous score played by a full orchestra.

-There are legit kills with fake blood and all, and a real working chair that actually dumps people through a trap door!

Other Positives:

-Josh Groban sounds great and plays well off Annaleigh, but overall thought his performance was just fine. Felt like when he was trying to come across as cold and cynical he just came across as a little vacant.

-Judge Turpin, Johanna, Pirelli and the Beggar Woman were all good (no Mea Culpa/Johanna Reprise for the judge in this production). Not really much to say about them, just all did what needed to be done.

-I have mixed feelings about the set, which is simultaneously elaborate and minimal. There’s a huge platform that spans the stage and moves up and down, as well as a big tower that has a few purposes. But for all the impressive mechanics, the “set” for each setting is just furniture that gets wheeled on and off, which leaves the stage feeling a bit barren at points.

559,"I saw ""Parade"" tonight, and all I can say is...GO SEE IT!!!",11d3eba,"I saw the NYCC performance, so I kind of knew what to expect, but the show has seriously impacted me ever since then. It's just one of those stories that sticks with you, especially because it's true. I was crossing every finger and toe for a Broadway transfer. I bought tix to see it the night after opening night (front row center), but I just knew I'd end up grabbing ""spur of the moment"" preview tix. There was no way I was going to make it until mid-March and I'm a very impulsive person. 

It's one of the best shows I've ever seen. The cast is spectacular. All of them. I was worried because Gaten Matarazzo didn't transfer with the show since he's doing ""Sweeney,"" but his replacement is PHENOMENAL. We were all buzzing about him during intermission. And there's already Tony talk about Alex Joseph Grayson. I have always been a huge Ben Platt fan, but even if you don't like him, I'd recommend giving him a chance in this. He's not playing Evan Hansen. He's actually playing a grown man. He's funny at times, his vocals are stunning, and you can tell that he's really just very committed to the role. And I have no words for how good Michaela Diamond is. The Tony's are going to be NUTS this year, but I'm placing my early bet on her for ""Best Actress."" (I know there's Annaleigh. I don't see that show until April. I think it's going to be one of those years where I just want everyone to win.)  

The staging, the orchestrations, the lighting, the acting, the singing, the costumes...I can't say a single bad word about it. I was hysterically crying before the end, and not just because it's a sad story, but because I was so moved. What a beautiful score by Jason Robert Brown. (There's a reason he won a Tony for it.) 

If you have the opportunity to see it, run don't walk. Oh, also, I was second row right orchestra and I was REALLY worried when I sat down that my view would be obstructed, but they did a great job of making sure everything can be seen. There may be a few ""blind spots,"" but it was nothing major.

Like most shows, I'd say the ideal seats would be 3rd or 4th row orchestra. But without giving too much away, I will say that they ""use the theater,"" which is very cool. It definitely makes you feel very immersed in the show. 

My only warning is that it's super depressing. I think most people already know that, but just be prepared.",HourAstronomer836,21,39,0.91
560,going in blind vs. watching other adaptations - what’s preferred?,11dslxi,"I’m curious about what people prefer to do when it comes to seeing a musical (particularly a revived one, and what, if any, is the preferred way to do it). the way I see it, there are a few ways to do it: 

- Go in relatively blind, with minimal knowledge of the plot/songs/lyrics. 
- Listen to the cast album, get a general feel for the plot/lyrics, but might be missing a few details/key scenes 
-Listen to the cast album + find a proshot/past version to watch for reference to get a feel of the show from start to finish and to have something to compare with

For me: I recently went to a touring local production of Fiddler on the Roof and went in not listening to the cast album before (thought I ended up knowing quite a few songs because…it’s Fiddler 😂) it was interesting to have no performances to compare it to because I’d never seen it performed before (and the Fruma Sarah dream sequence was BANANAS to experience without expecting it lol) In contrast, when Hamilton toured in my city, I’d seen the proshot and pretty much knew the ins and outs of what to expect, and could be more aware of how performers were adding their own spin to the role. 

I feel like I go back and forth - on one hand, experiencing a great piece of theater live with no preconceived notions can be magical, but I sometimes worry that I’ll miss lyrics or plot points or small nuances if I don’t have some degree of familiarity with the show. 

so - what is your preferred way to approach a show??

(some personal context if anyone cares - I’m seeing Sweeney Todd in April, and while I’ve listened to the original cast recording several times and know the plot, I’ve never seen a production all the way through - just clips - and idk if I should watch one before or just go in with what I know right now)",Deep_Blue_842,7,0,0.4

570,Saw Maude Apatow as Audrey last night - thoughts,11cogjj,"I had the joy of seeing the Little Shop revival last night! I was primarily there for Matt, who was really just incredible. But I know that’s not a surprise to y’all. Regarding Maude - she was fine? Wasn’t great, wasn’t bad. She can sing, but it was very clear that she wasn’t as strong vocally as the rest of the leads. Which is hard! Her voice felt a little thin, and she sounded like she had just listened to as many Audrey recordings as possible and was hitting them all beat for beat - nothing was her own. Which makes sense for a first role. Acting wise, it was a clear adjustment from tv to the stage - she wasn’t 100% on all the time, especially when she was in the background. I think because the show is in such an intimate theatre, everything was very noticeable. But I do think there’s strong potential if she did want to make a career out of it! She’s really warm and sincere and despite being so young, she did downtrodden Audrey well. I don’t think she could ever do a big show in a big venue, but with more vocal training and practice in this setting she could be really great in some smaller theaters.",Yikes_Brigade,1,46,0.92

572,"Recommendations, please! (Philadelphia - Kimmel Cultural Campus)",11d0fcu,"I got the Broadway/Musical bug for the first time at 35. The main musical venue here in Philly is the [Kimmel Cultural Campus, and these are the upcoming shows for most of 2023.](https://www.kimmelculturalcampus.org/events-and-tickets/ticket-deals/broadway/) All shows are Equity.

My girlfriend and I are very likely seeing Moulin Rouge.

These are the three shows I've seen, with my quick scores (out of 10.) Sans Les Miserables, I've been in the very front row for the other shows, so I'm willing to spend a bit:

**Les Miserables - 8.5/10:** Docking the score because of an uncomfortable, far-away seat that I'll never get again that was a consistent distraction, but otherwise, this show lived up to its legacy. I tend not to lean toward ""historical"" stuff like this, but it's Les Miz; dammit, I have to make exceptions.

**Jagged Little Pill - 8-ish/10:** I went into this blind beyond the concept of ""Alanis Morissette musical,"" and on the musical performance part, the performances of pretty much the entire cast, and the staging/etc., it was quite good. I didn't realize Diablo Cody wrote the book until I read the Playbill aaaaaand I wish I hadn't because it gave me a bit of dread because I am NOT fond of her style, and the show was peppered with her tropes that make me more groan than laugh but not TOO much to detract from it. I thought the plot was too on the nose as well. But overall, a fun show

**Come from Away - 9.5/10:** So I was pretty fucking blown away by this. All I knew was the basic premise. Sans one or two songs, I thought the music was exemplary; the performances (especially how the ensemble cast switch between sometimes disparate characters, almost within the same scenes, and the versatility that takes) impressed me, including times when the actual fucking band performing hops on stage to join in the action; the staging and the rotating platform and how that's used was unique; the brisk 100-minute show didn't overstay it's welcome, though I felt like it still could have used an extra ten or so minutes because I felt like there were times things felt rushed when they should have had moments to breathe a bit. Never cried, but did get choked up at least twice when it hit me just how much is happening and how seamlessly it's flowing, and how astonishing this all takes to make. Kind of the first time I thought, ""I get Broadway now.""

For example I bought okay seats ($110) for Wicked and the show was amazing the songs are very powerful and the sets and large and extravagant. But, I bought cheap seats ($60) for Hair Spray and is was awful, the sets were VERY small and you couldn't hear the songs well over the orchestra or really see much for that was going on. I'm kind of assuming cheaper seats for Moulin Rouge would be okay because I'm expecting very extravagant sets and maybe needing better seats for Hadestown since it is less over the top?

583,"Just got home from Kimberly Akimbo. Personally, I thought it was incredible.",11c5l7f,"So, I don't get to NYC much and try to see stuff when I'm here. This trip we'll only get one show and we chose Kimberly Akimbo. Admittedly, we didn't know a whole lot going in other than we had considered it when it was at The Atlantic last year.

It's clear this show gets a mixed review depending on who sees it, what they like, what they expected. For those who are considering it, let me offer my take:

* If you're looking for ""big broadway"" showmanship and spectacle, look elsewhere. This is a smaller show. You're not going to get huge sets and incredible costumes. 
* If you're looking for dancing, look elsewhere. This is not a show with a large chorus and intricate physicality.
* If you really want jaw-dropping vocal performances, look elsewhere. This cast, in my opinion, hits a home run on every score but no one is going to shatter a crystal glass. There are beautiful, delicate performances and a few songs belted out but you're not getting Ethel Merman.

So, why is this ""incredible?""

This show delivers what I hope for every time one walks through a theater threshold -- it lifts you up out of your chair, and away from whatever baggage you carried with you into the auditorium. Sometimes amazing theater does that with really beautiful, staggering, tragedy. Sometimes amazing theater does that with comedy. Most theater doesn't manage to do both, but Kimberly Akimbo did. 

* This show has so much heart that I was touched constantly and teared up numerous times.
* This show has so much heart that I was laughing throughout.
* This show has so much heart that I just felt alive, present, hopeful.
* The writing is clever and the performances funny in small and large ways.
* Every performer that I saw -- all from the original Atlantic off-broadway cast save one chorus member -- was exactly what they needed to be, square and on-the-money. 
* This show was unique in so many ways that I can't believe it even works -- but it works beautifully. 
* This story -- by all intents and purposes -- could be a downer but the alchemy of the writing and performance makes it as effectively humorous and effervescent, as it does tragic. 

This is great *theater* more than *classic broadway.*  

I never saw Hedwig and the Angry Inch live, sadly, but my gut tells me that this was a similar experience. Less gritty and kinky, obviously, and probably not quite as great if I'm being honest (Hedwig has some simply amazing songs), but I can't imagine having a more fulfilling and life-affirming live performance experience.",maywellbe,22,75,0.97
584,What musical is the hardest to understand just from the cast recording?,11c4seq,"I was thinking recently how I never ""got"" Pippin when I was a kid. Like a lot of people who didn't grow up in a major city, most of my exposure to new musicals came from cast recordings, pro shots, or movie adaptations.

I remember listening to the OBC recording of Pippin as a teenager and having no idea what that show was supposed to be about. The kids I knew who seemed to love it sang ""Corner of the Sky"" and it seemed so cheesy. I kind of wrote off the show as just not my thing. 

When I finally got to watch the national tour as an adult, I absolutely loved it, and it's become probably my favorite Stephen Schwartz show. But even listening to the revival cast recording as an adult, it's just confirmation that, yep, none of these songs make sense out of context.

585,Bad Cinderella Review,11c5ud2,"Here are my thoughts!

Liked:
- the dancing - choreography was fun and everyone was so talented 
- the costumes - I definitely see the POV of comments saying they feel random and unconnected, however, I really loved them! I'm a big fan of the neon and the big ball gowns
- the talent - everyone was fabulous
- some of the music - I liked the references to R&H's Cinderella, and Far Too Late was good
- the queer representation

Didn't like:
- the lyrics, overall, were terrible. It felt like the opposite of ""show, don't tell"". Like the songs had way too much (repetitive) exposition instead of showing us the feelings and thoughts and situations.
- the asynchronous singing in Unfair made me uncomfortable. So weird.
- the whole ""I Know You"" thing was such a moot point! Like wtf! It could've been so interesting and instead it just wasn't.
- the plot was just bad and dumb

Wtf:
- the homoerotic gym scene (which I guess is supposed to be over the top but just made me feel like I was in a leather daddy dungeon) and also the implied incest...? 
- Cinderella wearing a fancy shirt at the end which totally made the ""moral"" of the show pointless
- Creepy mad scientist godmother and her freaky stocking head statues
- when Cinderella turned into Elsa

586,Lestat the Musical,11cwy6s,"I’ve recently fallen in love, with this unloved and forgotten masterpiece.

I couldn’t believe it’s score was by Elton John and lyrics by Bernie Taulpin, of pop stardom because it’s so unique and different to anything else they have worked on together.

I saw on Wikipedia it was meant to get a cast recording, but for some reason it got recorded but never got released, which got me thinking it can’t be because of its short run, because the The Pirate Queen, Wonderland, Anyone can Whistle.

Had short runs in some cases far shorter than Lestat’s which got me thinking is something to do with the fact, The Film interview with a vampire existed before this musical, and once the studio who produced that, saw it was tanking on Broadway they decided to, stop the recording from releasing or was it Ann Rice and her portion of the rights.

588,Beetlejuice tour — boy do I miss Leslie Kritzer’s Delia,11c6zt9,"Although the Beetlejuice tour has a toned-down set compared to the Broadway production, it did a nice job filling that big hole in my heart after the Broadway closure. The Day-O number is the only one significantly affected by the simplified set, while the other scenes still kept the best parts on Broadway.

The cast was Superb. I believe I saw all the touring principles except Maxie Dean. The leading pair is not surprisingly the stand outs for me — Collette’s BJ did a great job modeling after Brightman’s turn (and I liked it better than Cober’s interpretation, the only understudy I got to see); Esler’s Lydia just sounded surreal — if this is only her professional debut, I can’t wait to see her officially breaking into Broadway. Esler had a quite noticeable tweak in “Creepy old guy”, where she added a pause after “even on the inside” and “he’s disgusting” — I think this was a clever choice and it actually got a big laugh from the audience.

The Barbra/Adam pair is quite refreshing and gives a new take on the characters (Coleman’s vocal is not as strong as Butler’s though). Their first song saw the biggest changes and had some new lyrics, which was very interesting to see.

The biggest thing I miss is Delia. Kritzer’s performance was absolutely perfect for the role: precise comedic timing probably fine tuned over years, and all the body movements and subtle body languages. Marilley’s acting was a bit broad and some jokes didn’t land quite well. Her vocal was awesome though.",gsd250,8,20,0.9
589,Changes to Bat out of Hell over the years?,11cjz05,"I'm a huge fan of Bat out of Hell and just recently had the opportunity to see the show on the West End! (It was amazing and I totally loved it!! Absolutely recommend 🔥) Anyway, about a year ago is when I started listening to the cast recording and there were a few songs in the recording that were not in the show (Who Needs the Young, Good Girls Go to Heaven, In the Land of the Pig the Butcher is King, and Not Allowed to Love (I think)). They had also removed some dialogue that I previously had heard was in the show. I knew about a few of the song omissions from various online posts, but I hadn't heard that any dialogue had been changed. 

I was wondering if anyone who saw it in its earlier iterations could tell me in what context those numbers appeared in the show (mostly I'm interested in how Good Girls Go to Heaven fit in). Also, if anyone knows or has any theories as to why they took out some of the dialogue (Zahara giving Raven dream suppressants, Strat's monologue after Raven finds him at the beginning of the second act were the two instances I noticed) I'd be interested to know! It made the show a bit shorter (I want to say it cut out 10-15 minutes, I think the total run time was around 2 hrs 20 including intermission) but I'm scratching my head as to why they needed to make it any shorter in the first place--it's already an average runtime in my opinion. (Also--major spoiler alert here, so stop reading now to avoid spoilers 🛑 --did Tink originally die in earlier versions of the show?

601,Adding to the Bad Cinderella reviews......,11b068x,"I was at the performance last night and I will absolutely agree with what was said in other posts. And no, people are not doing this for fun. I would never enjoy ripping a show apart. But how anyone can think this is Broadway caliber musical theatre is beyond me. (I have by protective gear on, so I am ready for backlash) I honestly went in with an open mind. I usually end up liking most ALW shows or something from them, so I was hoping for a pleasant surprise (or at least one song I could belt in my car)…nope! The #1 positive I will say is the lighting was brilliant and should be applauded. I wanted to like the costumes (because each female ensemble has at least 6) but the colors and dramatic cuts just kept going from period to modern. That was the problem…no consistency with anything. No answers, no follow through! I went with a friend who was at the invited dress and he said barely any of the book (or much of anything) had changed.    
This poor thread has been backed to pieces because most are in agreement, so I’ll just give my opinion and exit…hopefully as well as Carolee does at the end of the ball scene!

Cindy is not BAD! Everyone is so vile and vein for only caring about their looks. But that’s all good because it’s a fairytale. I mean eye candy for days, but at points I was saying “stop trying to blind us from everything else that is off point.   


The Music?!? How many times do we hear “Bad Cinderella” being sung? Then it goes into non stop ballad mode. Which just gets stuck on repeat because at that point in Act 2 everything sounds the same.

The only character you wanted to see was Stepmother! Carolee is that constant professional that will get the job done no matter what and she proved it again. Chewing on the scenery, she made it work. She upstages the stepsisters and I believe the Queen as well…it’s wonderful! 

There was NO chemistry between Sebastian and Cinderella. The last 5 minutes of the show was laughable, because through their “journey”, there is nothing to follow. The kiss looked like my 7th grade dance. 

I may be in the minority here but Prince Charming did nothing for me in any way. It was overdone. I liked the twist that I saw coming from 3 miles away, just nothing.

and the Godmother?!? 5 minutes of stage time and gives back the necklace like its garbage? 

Jordan Dobson truly was out of his league, vocally didn’t have it and this was the same as invited dress. Reminded me of high school theatre. Linedy, who I wanted to love, saw her Gloria and she nailed that role, was just angry. Most of the time her diction needed major work. They added more of a Latina accent to her character, especially in the end of Act 2 and it came from no where.   


I saw the creative team in the back at intermission and they just looked tired and frustrated. Someone asked for an autograph from Laurence and Joanne and they did but there was no joy. 

The last thing was the audience. We had 2 younger generation (early twenties) theatre goers behind us and they would scream (high pitch) after every number and whoop whenever they could, necessary or not. I am not old and a proud GenX member. Have nothing again ANY theater goer, but at intermission we could clearly hear them say “We will scream louder and make sure they know it’s us to turn this show into a f\*cking hit.” My friend turned around to the male and said (ever so politely) “If you scream in my ear any louder, I will make sure you are escorted out, now that we all heard you are doing it on purpose.” They both didn’t say a word, but right away during the ball, the first time a female was lifted up they both started clapping when the entire audience was dead silent and they continued that for a long time. Then the screams came back. No words. 

The audience had the last 2 rows empty in the rear orchestra and some scatters. 

This is just my opinion, wanted so much more the job security of the cast and crew. But who knows what will happen. ",TjonC,35,88,0.88
602,Best days and times to be more likely to see lead instead of understudy?,11c85yo,"In late March/Early April, I'm going to see Moulin Rouge, but the only reason I even wanted to see it in the first place is for Aaron Tveit.

The weakest part are the lyrics. Some of it is just too simplistic.

The score is pretty classic ALW. The recitative-ish songs were not great but the big numbers were catchy and harken back to some of his previous, better work.

Lighting was phenomenal.

The staging was fine. They overdid the turntable usage I'd say, but the set was what you'd expect from a big musical.

The cast was mostly great though the actor in the leading male role didn't seem to have the vocal chops for his solo number.

609,Could use a little help picking shows in London for trip in May :),11be3oe,"Hi All,

My family of four will be visiting London (from California) mid May.  My two (University aged) daughters and I love theatre and have seen most of the long running and recent Broadway shows.  

With London's Theatre Week prices available, I want to buy tickets now for shows we will see when there.

Would love to see new and original shows or long time shows like Mousetrap but would also love suggestions on great fringe shows or brilliant West End shows that may have not hit the US yet.

The few that are not so new or original that we will probably be seeing are, Heathers (my girls love this one), Cabaret, Bonnie & Clyde and maybe Guys and Dolls.

Which others should we consider.  Is Mousetrap still great?  Are there special fringe plays/musicals we shouldn't miss?

611,I saw the new Outsiders musical at La Jolla Playhouse last night!,11au68u,"It's always exciting to see a brand new musical that has its eyes set on Broadway. I saw the third preview of The Outsiders last night, and overall I really enjoyed it. This is the very first production of this musical, and with it being the third preview, I'm sure a lot will be tweaked and changed. The very beginning even had a moment where the stage manager had to say ""Hold Please"" and then the artistic director let us know that new scenes were added that day. 

However I thought the show was in a pretty good shape from this preview. The whole cast is absolutely excellent, and felt incredibly grounded and comfortable in their characters. All three of the main brothers (Ponyboy, Soda-pop, and Darrel) stood out to me especially, but there were no weak links in the cast. 

The musical follows the novel pretty closely, with a few changes to better adapt the story to stage of course. I thought the book of the show was pretty good. The scenes were heartfelt and many of them felt like they came right from the novel. The show didn't shy away from the darkness of the novel and the end of the second act especially had The perfect tone and pacing. 

The score was hit or miss for me though. I loved the style of music. It absolutely felt rooted in the 60s and Tulsa setting. There were just no songs that were very memorable and the lyrics weren't my favorite either. There were a lot of songs and they kind of meshed together to me. But none of the music took me out of the show or the story. And it's only the third preview, so things will probably continue to evolve.

The real highlight for me was the staging and choreography. The design elements were all fantastic, especially lighting. Every dance sequence was thrilling and so well choreographed. They did a great job making the dancing feel normal for the characters. And they also combined a lot of props into the choreography which worked well. The fight sequences were also incredible. The rumble sequence in act 2 was jaw dropping, just so well staged in every way. 

Overall I think there's a lot of potential to this show. I think as they continue to rewrite sections and work on the pacing it will only get better. While it's by no means perfect I think it captures the novel pretty well and is an exciting and touching musical. I think if it goes to Broadway it has a good chance at being pretty successful.",WoodFirePizzaIsGood,6,27,0.95

615,bad cinderella is a completely insane show,11akidb,"spoilers incoming!!!

i saw bad cinderella on tuesday and after collecting my thoughts for a bit i wanted to share my two cents. for context, i work in the industry so i've a LOT of shows in my time, but i'm not connected to this production in any way. i like to use this subreddit because i'm usually not able to share my opinions IRL for obvious reasons.

i truly believe that andrew lloyd webber had two shows he wanted to follow up school of rock with, but the backlash about the cats movie greatly sped up his timeline in putting together a new money-maker and he had to make do with what he had.

in this way, bad cinderella feels like two separate stories jam-packed into a 2.5 hour show. on the one hand, we have the actual cinderella plot which is pretty simple. a girl named cinderella lives with her two step-sisters and evil step-mother and gets to go to a ball for one night. she meets a fairy godmother who dresses her all up, she goes, everything falls apart at midnight, and she has to run away and leave a shoe behind. prince finds her, they marry. done. of course in this version cinderella is an intentional social outcast who thinks poorly of everyone around her and is convinced she's the only person who's actually ~unique~, and somehow she's known the prince since birth (which makes no sense) so they're in love before the ball, and i'm pretty sure the godmother is not magic but ""just"" a plastic surgeon but they don't actually make that super clear because there is magic in the show.

then there's the other plot. there's a kingdom full of beautiful people whose crown prince goes missing a year ago. they all looked up to him and admired his strength, and when they erected a statue in his honor, a mean girl ruins it all by spray painting the statue and just insults people all the time. the ""evil"" queen is actually pretty normal and just wants to be beautiful, because that's all the town wants, and she doesn't really do anything bad that we see. she neglected her younger son in favor of her older one, but when he went missing, she started to appreciate her youngest more. then the older son comes back and it's happily ever after.

if they just took the entire cinderella plot out the show would actually be awesome. grace mclean totally kills it as the queen, the village is totally camp and everything is oversexualized on purpose and it's incredibly funny and interesting to watch. prince sebastian and cinderella have one incredibly long and boring song together and they EACH get THREE separate ballad-y solos which all blend together by the end of the show because the music is so bland. each of their costumes are sooooo uninspired next to the amazing costumes for the queen and stepmother (as well as all of the villagers, really). the script for everything they said was incredibly cringe and the whole vibe in the room was awkward and no longer fun when it was just them two on stage. this is not to say that the two lead actors are bad, ESPECIALLY linedy because she's obviously a great singer, but they are given the most boring and bland material to work with.

i think ALW wanted an existing IP to frame the show around so he didn't have to be super creative with the plot because playwriting isn't really what he does. i also feel incredibly bad for linedy specifically because this will easily be the biggest role of her career and it's a total flop. during curtain call she got noticeably less applause than the supporting cast which, again, i think is because she didn't really get to show off her skills.

anyway, long post, thanks for reading if you did. i would love to know what other people think.",yelizabetta,46,99,0.97

617,Musical of the Week,11ax510,"Musical: *Kiss of the Spider Woman*

Music: John Kander 

Lyrics: Fred Ebb 

Book: Terrence McNally

Premise (per Wikipedia): *Kiss of the Spider Woman* “is based on the Manuel Puig novel *El Beso de la Mujer Araña*. It takes place in a prison in Argentina. The main character, Molina, lives in a fantasy world to flee the prison life, the torture, fear and humiliation. His fantasies turn mostly around movies, particularly around a vampy diva, Aurora. He loves her in all roles, but one scares him: This role is the spider woman, who kills with her kiss.”

*Kiss of the Spider Woman* premiered in the West End in 1992, where it was nominated for 5 Olivier Awards, winning 1. It transferred to Broadway in 1993 with the same main cast (Chita Rivera, Brent Carver, Anthony Crivello), receiving 11 Tony nominations, winning 7, including Tonys for Rivera, Carver, and Crivello.

620,"Skip ""A Doll's House"" on broadway, and everything else directed by Jamie Lloyd here on out.",11ah20t,"The director of this ""A Doll's House,"" Jamie Lloyd, has been officially added to my ""do not see anything they are involved with no matter what"" list after my partner and I struggled to make it through this production. 

We had previously seen Jamie Lloyd's production of ""Betrayal"" which also, I kid you not, featured slowly rotating circles in the center of the stage. It seems like his ""directing"" style is to take a neo-classsical play, cast bankable stars, and then abandon these said stars to slowly rotate around the stage on different concentric circles while they whisper lines to one another. 

Pretension has oozed from each of his productions, from the ""paired down"" (money saving) lack of sets, costumes, or even props, to the music, which all seems to be pulled from the same shitty electronic Pandora station that has been running continuously since 2006 and has begun to eat itself.  

At least the production of Betrayal wasn't a new adaptation, while this adaptation of ""A Doll's House"" is so excited for Nora to say ""Fuck"" it forgets to add any complexity to any of the characters. Torvald especially suffers in this adaptation, starting the play as an irredeemable ass and ending the play as an irredeemable ass. 

It's such a shame, because Jessica is a fantastic Nora, and all of the actors are doing their damndest to make it work up there. But when the climactic conversation between Nora and Torvald takes place with both actors sitting next to each other in chairs, facing out into the audience, you just have to ask yourself ""why?"" 

Indeed why, Jamie Lloyd, have you done this again? What ""stripped down"" neo-classical play will you present next? A Midsummer Night's Dream, featuring fairies in black turtlenecks slowly rotating around the stage in concentric circles? Maybe another Ibsen, like Peer Gynt, where the hoard of goblins bursting from the mountain can be represented by a single Juliard grad with a black button-up, sitting on a stool, which will slowly rotate around the stage in concentric circles?

2,Need some advice on preparing for Broadway trip!,11ahuto,"Hi! I’m going to NYC, for the first time in 10 years, in early April.

I am staying from Thursday to Sunday,  so I have 6 slots for shows(including 2 matinee shows in the weekend).

Since the primary purpose of this trip is to see Aaron Tveit in Moulin Rouge, I am planning to see MR twice. 

Also I will definitely catch Little Shop of Horrors and Parade, since I’m a big fan of both shows.

Then I have to choose 2 more shows which I will choose between Sweeney Todd, Funny Girl, Some Like It Hot, Kimberly Akimbo and New York New York - depending on lottery results or rush/TKTS availability. 


So, here are my questions:

1. I’ve already bought a ticket for MR for one evening. I’m thinking of buying the other one at TKTS booth, but I am not sure how are TKTS seats for Moulin Rouge, generally.

I know that the availability changes everyday no one can tell which seat I will get, but I would really appreciate it if anyone has bought MR tickets at TKTS.

+ also want to ask the same thing with Funny Girl TKTS seats!

2. I don’t see LSOH on TKTS live, so should it be better to buy the ticket in advance? Or is there any other decent deal for Little Shop of Horrors?

3. I really want to see Sweeney Todd, but there are only a few seats left and the prices are too expensive for me. And I highly doubt that these price will ever go down.

I know we need to wait until the show starts preview performances later this week, but does anyone know about the possibility of rush tickets?

This is my first ever Reddit post so hope I’m doing it right…
I’m headed to New York for a work trip and have time to catch one of these three shows on Saturday night. I did really want to see Lea Michele in Funny Girl but know she’s on holiday at the moment and I will probably be back for another trip in April/May so will try to see that then. 
Hadestown has been on my list forever (I missed it when it was in London a few years ago) but I have seen some posts on here that SLIH/KA might close soon so not sure if I should prioritise one of these, especially if I’ll be back in a couple of months. 
I live in London and am at the theatre over here often and slightly unhelpfully, love everything from character-driven, less glitzy shows like The Last Five Years and The Band’s Visit to the big tap numbers in Anything Goes or 42nd Street and everything in between.

18,Funny Girl: Why do so many people say the book is bad?,11a4v4x,"
I went to see a Swedish production of Funny Girl last week. I admit I've been pretty much hooked on the Broadway drama... so I figured, even though I can't travel to Broadway to see the very production in question, maybe I should go see this one, so I can at least say I've seen the musical itself.

When it comes to the book, I went in with really low expectations, since I've read many comments criticising it, and Funny Girl always seems to come up in those ""name a musical where the music is great but the book sucks"" threads. I was pleasantly surprised to notice it's not that bad at all. I mean, it's certainly not Shakespeare – but I thought it was nice, with a three-dimensional main character, a bunch of funny moments and a bittersweet romance. I don't suppose it's in any way a realistic retelling of the real Fanny Brice's life, but as a fictional story about an ambitious woman, I liked it.

So I'd love to hear your thoughts about this! What do you think about Funny Girl's book? Am I missing something, is it really as bad as people keep saying, or does it receive more criticism than it deserves?

Also, here's something I noticed about the Swedish production/translation: the actress playing Fanny in Sweden is a taller-than-average woman, and they kept mentioning that in the show. In or around the song ""If a Girl Isn't Pretty"", it was specified Fanny is not a good fit for a chorus line because she is too tall. The actor playing Nick is also very tall, which resulted in more banter: Fanny's mom said Nick reminds her of Fanny's father, who was also tall and someone you should keep away from, and in the 2nd act, Nick said he and Fanny need a big house because their baby is probably going to be ""grotesquely tall.""

I don't think any of the women who have played Fanny on Broadway have been especially tall, so I suppose this is something they added to the Swedish translation to make it suit this particular cast better. I'm curious to know if there are references to some other physical attribute in the Broadway production, or if these things were simply added into the script in Sweden?",Ingifridh,8,3,0.58

However, with the flight schedule, I have an opportunity to catch an additional Saturday matinee before I depart. For this show, I would probably just get a cheaper seat. Here's what I'm looking at and I would love any feedback or suggestions.

1. Parade - I am huge Ben Platt fan and it would be so amazing to see him live. Parade seems like a cultural moment that would be exciting to be a part of. After reading the plot online it looks so heart-wrenching and difficult to watch. I've never heard any of the music.
2. Some Like it Hot - Who doesn't love Christian Borle? This one looks like a lot of fun and it seems like this sub really likes it.
3. Hadestown - I've seen the boot of this and think it would be great to see in person. The cast seems incredible, though I'm pretty meh on Reeve Carney. This one tours and will probably be near my town again in a couple of years.

55,Here's a totally HONEST review of Bad Cinderella,118qa0o,"[As promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/114x4ta/comment/j8ywrmn/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), here is a totally **honest review** of Bad Cinderella. Well less of a review and more like dumping all of my notes. It's a lot so I put in a TLDR

**First, what do I mean by honest review**: Bad Cinderella is getting a lot of hate because people are starting to hate Andrew Lloyd Webber, especially after [what happened to the London cast](https://deadline.com/2022/05/andrew-lloyd-webber-cinderella-protests-broadway-1235015140/). A lot of people are also bandwagoning on the hate train just for fun. People are going into the show ready to hate it (more on that down below). I liked the original demo ALW put out so I was excited to see it on West End but then it came to Broadway. normally I don't do previews but I did not want to believe it was as bad as everyone was saying it was. So was it?

**The TLDR:** NO it's not ""bad"" and definitely not as bad as people have been trying to make it seem (for example calling it the worst show on Broadway ever).....That being said, it's not ""good"" either. It's okay, mediocre and non-memorable. If you like Broadway shows or if you're a tourist it's worth seeing on a discount ticket. I would not break anything trying to get a ticket though. It's not something you're going to write home about (good or bad). If you go in expecting it to be bad you will be just as disappointed as if you went in expecting ALW's next Phantom.

**So what are you getting for your money:**

**The gist:** This is Bubblegum theater. It's fleeting, poppy, and campy. Nothing about it, from the music to the story/character screams timeless, especially compared to ALW's other work. Instead it's just temporary, contemporary fun. It almost feels like ALW's adult and raunchy take on pantomime-ish fairytale theater. The style of humor is definitely more British than what we're used to. It's not really sophisticated at all. Like British humor, it's taking not being serious serious. It's on the level of Legally Blonde the musical, mean girls or heathers. For example the Telltale sign of bubblegum theater IMO is when the female singers have to sing and talk in that [high](https://youtu.be/duU09GD-KUU?list=PLrwULm_Oktsh5Mld2NDSKzRARFnp985On&t=166) pitched [nasally](https://youtu.be/tq_WkZot7ic?list=PLupXxjRq48fSpb26zpYC9d0sDRPcb2uLj&t=183), [baby](https://youtu.be/-KycXHeUxho?list=PL63o9Jv8Yfo-_rcgFP7L26x7tWLvBEXYk&t=133) girl, [cheerleader](https://youtu.be/ykqSK0-YtqE?t=84), [valley girl](https://youtu.be/BQOoTX1Nxx8?list=PLsKQ_-bOmMesrFyPdBYeOH-f2R2dTR8HH&t=100) voice, and there is a lot of that in this.

**The story:** The story is so-so. If you don't know it's about a town where superficiality and vanity are the norm, but Cinderella is ""not like the other girls"" in town. She's a rebel who doesn't care about beauty and airheadeness. Meanwhile the Prince is NOT Prince Charming. He's his dweeby little brother. And that's about it. The rest of the story is the same Cinderella story. It's not really adding much to the tale, which makes you wonder why? Why do we need another Cinderella story? The girl has already been genderswapped, anachronized, time-traveled, hip-hopped, modernized, race-swapped and reimagined ad nauseum. This version doesn't really add anything special to the story or use the story to make any compelling statement. Even the ending is anticlimactic. You know what's going to happen, so when Cinderella and the prince >!kiss and run off together!< you are left wondering why you don't give a shit. Nothing in the story made you think that was not going to happen or it was at jeopardy.

**The good:**

* The visuals are stunning and the production is top notch. The set design deserves a Tony, if I'm being honest. It was impressive. The costumes were also beautiful. The audio was interesting. They did some mixing, including echo effects, I never really heard before in a broadway theater. The  other sound mixing effects made everything really clear.
* The humor, in my opinion, was just right for the show. It's tongue and cheek humor, at times bawdy. Not as overly camp and silly as I thought it would be.
* The main actors. Linedy Genao impressed me. She carries the show well and had a couple really good ballads, even though from a marketing perspective I would have gone for a bigger name to play Cinderella because even with a great actress like Genao, the show is so mediocre, you need to give the audience at least a big headliner. I love that she let her Brooklyn accent and dialect shine through her character. It got progressively prominent over the course of the show. Some people were annoyed with Grace McLean's vibrato in Great Comet but it really sounds lovely in her role as the queen. All of the other main actors were great (except one I won't name. They  were over doing it like the chorus, which I'll explain in the next section)

**The bad:** Here's what can be fixed.

* There were some parts that need to be re-worked. Overall the pacing is off. The opening scene is a mess. It's too much happening and not really saying much. The opening song Buns and Roses, changed DRAMATICALLY from the demo and West End show, which was a bad choice. That was my favorite song form the demo and set the tone up nicely and they kind of messed it up by writing a completely different song. It goes too fast at parts that should slow down and explain what's happening and drags at parts and jokes we don't need spelled out.  And WTF with the lanterns???! Shining bright ass headlights into the audience's eyes. Definitely get rid of that!
* The actors have been getting a lot of praise as the show's saving grace. I disagree a little on that. I heard an actor say once that the key to good comedy acting is playing a character that believes that the silly thing they are doing is normal and takes it seriously. That's not what happens with the Bad Cinderella chorus. You can tell they don't believe in the work they are performing and too aware of how camp and silly it is. I think this is why so many people trashing the show all mention how the actors clearly look embarrassed. I think camp is actually REALLY hard to pull off. You can't phone in camp. Meanwhile the actresses playing the main roles, especially the queen and stepmother, perhaps due to being more seasoned actors, really lean into their character's ridiculousness and sell it. I think if the chorus actors play into the characters more instead of being too aware of the camp it would come across as more genuinely funny.
* Some scenes were anticlimactic. The introduction of the Ball scene which opens the second act should be the most memorable scene, but they put more effort into the choreography for the incestuous ""Man's Man"" gym number (which was perfect btw) than the ball scene, which was a shame.
* The fairy godmother is offensively under-used. Not even going to go into the Magical Negro stereotype they perpetuate by underusing the character so much and consistently casting black women for the role. Nonetheless she does her thing to Cinderella but then just randomly appears at the end to save the day and has no other backstory or reason for why she is the way she is. Her character could be completely cut and you have Cinderella make her own dress and there'd be no difference. They need to do more with her character and give her some sort of backstory and closer relationship to Cinderella and Belleville (she doesn't even appear in the town until she's needed).
* Same goes for Prince Charming, whose number is a scene stealer and showstopper only to be undermined by how it's rushed and quickly wrapped up \[Big spoiler\]>! immediately at the end of the number with the queen simply jumping on board with everything. One simple dialogue exchange between her and charming could have made the scene more powerful and meaningful. !<

**The ugly:** There was nothing truly ""ugly"" or awful about this show. It's not amazing but it's not awful. The audience was kind of annoying. This was definitely not the tourist crowd. It was definitely a hardcore theater crowd. You can tell everyone was THIRSTING to hate this show. There were numbers, jokes and scenes that definitely should have gotten louder applause. Toward the second act people started to loosen up and realize it wasn't as bad as they wanted it to be and would clap more but that first act, whew, you could feel the hate watching. It was kind of funny how much people wanted to not like it.

This was a fun show that is worth a Rush, Lottery, TDF, TKTS  or groupon ticket. I wouldn't shell out for it. And I don't think it's ALW greatest work. It's candy. It's bubblegum, which is not for everyone, especially for people who take theater seriously. Don't take it so seriously. Honestly, if freaking Beetlejuice and Heathers can have as strong following as they do this is a fine show.

58,A rant about kids in theatres,118npyd,"I hope this doesn’t come across as rude but I just had quite a tainted experience watching Hadestown due to two children sat near me. 2 x parents and 2 x children came to the show (ages 5 and 8 approximately). Father and son sat next to me, daughter and mother sat in front of me. The children were continuously chatty, asking for snacks, crinkling, dropping things, leaning on each others seats/poking each other, and the boy was pressing up against me and sometimes leant on me. At one point I looked to the young boy to my side and he was picking his nose and putting his fingers in his mouth. Every time there was a quiet or emotional moment, they would talk through it. I understand that Theatre is for everyone and that we all deserve a night out, but as a child-free person who is a teacher, I go to the theatre to escape and be in an adult environment, which is why I picked Hadestown over a Disney show. Of course you cannot choose who you sit next to and I know some adults are just as annoying, but I cannot think of what such young children would have got out of the show. I’m not the sort of person to say anything but I just wanted to ask you all what you believe Theatre etiquette surrounding children should be. If I’m perfectly honest, if your children could significantly impact the experience of others, I think they aren’t old enough to go to a show.",GreenReputation5267,91,134,0.9
59,Funny Girl Review: with Julie Benko (U/S Fanny) & Jeremiah James (U/S Nick Arnstein),118njgp,"Third time seeing funny girl. saw it once with Beanie, then Lea and now Julie! Julie was INCREDIBLE. So impressed. It is an embarrassment that the producers put her as the understudy under Beanie. There were times where I thought Lea was better and times where Julie was better. Overall I prefer lea tbh. I just think her presence on stage is much stronger although Julie lowkey has the acting and comedic hand on Lea. So glad to have seen julie. she is a must see. i was happy to see the orchestra was sold out for her performance. How many were comp tickets though is the question. As for Jeremiah, I was very impressed. No one can beat Ramin and I felt as if Jeremiah looked a bit stiff on stage. I wonder how many times Ramin actually misses the show. Side note: I was bummed to see Ramin was out. i know he will be out later in the week as previously announced but I was really expecting to see him tonight. I also thought for a tuesday night show after a day off plus a 4 or 5 show weekend, the energy was the best i’ve seen it out of the three times (worst energy being beanies show. my god i almost fell asleep).

69,Bad Cinderella is really… really bad. Review in Comments,1186h8m,"I’ve seen a lot of mixed reviews on this. I just want to set the record straight: this is really bad show. people are doing everything they can to find positives because they hate to degrade theater and these poor actors that have worked months on it. The truth is, ALW should be embarrassed to have put this show on broadway. You can tell on the actors faces that they’re even embarrassed to be performing some parts of the show. really really cringey. The costumes are good but they’re all over the place. You have half the cast in medieval dresses and suits and then you have someone walk on  stage wearing practically a sweatshirt. What is the thought process behind this? the songs (basically all of them) were extremely forgettable and the lyrics were cheesy. Is this another Diana the Musical? no. The cast itself is hard to grade on because of the material that was provided to them. Overall, the ensemble was excellent. Carolee Carmello was good, not great. The set was pretty cool I think they MIGHT get a nomination for set if they even get nominated for anything. I saw people commenting that it was a fun show? I completely disagree. It was a train wreck and I sat there curled up in my seat cringing at most parts of the show.  Yes it’s only previews, but I really don’t see them changing much. They would have to change basically the entire show if they wanted to fix anything. 
With all that being said, I am so glad I saw it so I can see the disaster for myself. Again, this is no shade to the actors and crew backstage. they were dealt with what they were given. they worked with what they had.",Nice-Jackfruit-9894,75,239,0.94

106,A Doll’s House and Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window Reviews,116il9j,"A Doll’s House 

I love Jessica Chastain, and really enjoyed meeting her at the stage door. She took my BeReal for me and was just so so kind. Aarin Moayed and Oak were super nice too! 

In terms of the production, it was still in previews, so I didn’t know much going in. I was not expecting what I saw. There is no set aside from a turntable and one chair per character and the costumes are all just everyday black clothing. I didn’t fully get this choice I guess. There was hardly any blocking as well, which made it a bit boring. If I wasn’t such a big Chastain fan I don’t think I would’ve enjoyed it, but I just like seeing her. This is the least I’ve paid for a Broadway ticket and it’s the farthest back I’ve ever sad, which I am now very happy about, because I would’ve been pissed if I paid 200 bucks to sit in the orchestra to see nothing happen on stage. I’m a very big believer that the vast majority of art should be entertaining first, and this was not that. It was just very dull and felt like a reading of the text. I don’t mind scaled down productions (I love the Into the Woods revival) but this just wasn’t enough to justify the price. I saw someone else say that there were a lot of lines played for laughs that shouldn’t have been, and I agree.

The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window

Again, came because I’m a huge Oscar Isaac fan. Performances in this were fantastic, but I didn’t love the text itself. It was a bit too broad, stuffy, and very preachy. Also, the audience of white liberals didn’t seem to understand that they were the ones being made fun of. Like, there was a lot of laughter at Iris, who is white with a Cherokee grandfather , did a dance that was clearly her mocking Native American dancing. The production also made a lot of choices that I didn’t quite understand — for instance, at one point in the show three characters bring out chairs to watch the other three which I guess I didn’t get. I like strange (Angels in America is my favorite play) but this one just felt strange without a reason, which didn’t feel right. Rachel Brosnahan was really a stand out. Oscar Isaac did great too. As much as I love him as an actor, however, I have to admit I’m tired of him playing Jewish roles when he is not. I liked Sign but it felt a tad long and made me a bit confused at times. The characterization was great but the dialogue was really stiff (people don’t talk like that)! Overall, I’m glad I experienced it, but I wouldn’t pay for it again.",xbrooksie,18,30,0.92

If not, does the horse motif show up more than just with Trunchbull and Mrs. Wormwood's songs (i.e. do you ever see a horse visually/mentioned in the nonmusical dialogue?) 

I've been listening to the soundtrack and just finally watched the musical movie yesterday hoping that it might help me understand the horse motif more, but it didn't. The only horses I recall seeing are at the end with the carousel. And I can't for the life of my understand why the horse motif exists with these two women in particular (and ig, by extension Lavender, if even applicable)

Then this girl behind me decides she wants to belt along to the music the whole first act. I looked at my boyfriend during the intermission and said super loudly “I love spending hundreds of dollars to hear someone else’s crappy off tune singing in my ear.” 

She def heard me because I could hear her complaining to her friends about me for being “mean.” She also dropped her phone under my seat twice. She would tap me to retrieve it. Put. The. Damn. Phone. Away. And. This. Wouldn’t. Be. A. Problem.

Crowds for her stage door were crazy. They were pilling into the streets and there were lines of people on both sides of the sidewalk around the stage door. A few of the other cast members came out, Lana Gordon signed many Playbills and was extremely nice. When Jinkx came out though, there was such an uproar to see her. Jinkx promised to sign everyone’s playbills, posters, shirts, etc. Once she did all of that she took a photo with every single person who wanted it. The process took her around an hour.

115,A Doll's House: don't waste your money (SPOILERS),11647n9,"I see a lot of theater and never post reviews. Never ever. My wife and I will see almost anything and we're rarely dissatisfied. But A Doll's House at the Hudson is very new (we saw the 4th preview) and I haven't seen any other reviews, so I feel somewhat compelled to say: this production is an absolute waste of your time and money.

TOTAL SPOILERS AHEAD: stop reading if you don't want to know exactly how this production is staged. I'll assume people are familiar with the story and just focus on the artistic choices.

First off, there is no set, no costumes, and no props. I mean this quite literally. The entire production (a one-act, running nearly 2 hours with no intermission) is done on a bare stage with just a couple of chairs, in front of the naked back wall of the theater. The actors wear all black throughout. Any time the script calls for two actors to exchange or interact with an object, they just stand there for a moment, looking intense. This takes minimalism to an absurd extreme.

Almost all of the dialog is done in monotone with very little inflection or expression. Nora is slightly more emotive than the other characters but not by much. The delivery of the lines is completely disconnected from the text. Most of the characters speak their lines as if they're reading the phone book. A lot of the character interactions are staged with the actors not facing each other... Nora and Krogstad have an entire scene done back-to-back, her facing the audience and him facing the back wall, each speaking meaningless words into a void.

There's an awkward pre-show routine involving the characters which I won't even go into right now.

This one is subject to interpretation but: Nora's contemplation of suicide is a primary plot point. (And Krogstad's to a much smaller degree.) A lot of the dialog is centered on this theme, so much that it dominates the second half of the show. I can't read Danish so I don't know how it's treated in the original, but I don't know of any other English translation that emphasizes this so heavily.

There was also a lot of comedy at unexpected moments, including laugh lines that really should not have been funny. And Nora had some attempted rallying cries at the end that the audience didn't know what to do with.

Finally: something big happens at the very end. Nora crosses upstage right and for her exit, does something that causes the audience to gasp and cheer. But she's out of view for anyone seated house left. I have absolutely no idea what she did to get that reaction, and unless another attendee (without the misfortune of sitting house left) spoils it, I guess I never will.

The director clearly had some profound artistic vision, but I am utterly baffled as to what it might have been. The whole thing struck me as a pretentious attempt to do something ""bold"" that fell flat. If you've ever read the text or seen another production, you're likely to be confused. I don't know what this show is but it's somewhat offensive to call it A Doll's House.",TheOneTheyCallAlpha,38,126,0.94

118,Guide on getting an Aaron Tveit signed playbill,1161n5n,"Hello! I’ve been noticing this question has been frequently getting asked this past couple of weeks of “Is Aaron stagedooring” and “How can I get Aaron to sign a playbill”. Aaron Tveit is currently not stagedooring to sign (I’ve been told he has been waving, but not signing), so here is my guide to getting a signed playbill from Aaron Tveit ft my own signed playbill! Mods, if you’d like to pin this, you have my permission! 

1) Get two envelopes. I have a larger 8x11-ish envelope addressed to the theater that I fold & tape to fit into the mailbox and to fit a 6x9 envelope addressed & stamped envelope. On both envelopes, I personally put one forever stamp and two extra one-ounce stamps, but I have also seen others put on two forever stamps without any issue! On the envelope being shipped to the theater, I put my address in the sender area and the theater address as follows:

Aaron Tveit
Al Hirschfeld Theater
302 West 45th St
New York, NY 10036

On the other smaller sized envelope that I include in the envelope addressed to the theater(the envelope Aaron will use to send you the playbill back), I put my address in BOTH the receiver and the sender address parts! This is just in case the post office makes a mistake and the playbill gets to me no matter what. ***If you are international, make sure to add “USA” to the bottom of the address and include the required amount of stamps for international postage!

2) Include a note! I personally wrote a note about how I loved seeing Aaron’s Tango de Roxanne from the front row and how his version made me extremely emotional. At the end, I asked him if I could receive a personalized signed playbill only if he had enough time to do so. I thanked him for his time and wished him the best.
I personally did not include a donation for this request as most cast members usually do not require a donation for individually signed playbills. Side note, if you use this guide to request a CAST signed playbill, always include a donation!! Some shows have specific minimums for donations! 

3) Make sure BOTH your envelopes are stamped, addressed, and sealed! YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SEND HIM A PLAYBILL!! The theater will provide the actors (in this case Aaron) playbills to sign and send out. If you would like a particular item signed such as your own personal playbill, pictures, trading cards, etc please send at your own risk! There is always a chance of things getting lost in the mail or actors misplacing items. I have seen a few people in a Fb group I’m a part of have items not returned (eg someone posted the other day about how Aaron signed one pic and forgot to include the other when sending it back. Don’t forget, actors are humans too! You are sending items at your own risk! Aaron included an unsigned prop franc with my playbill. I saw a few other people receive one as well, but I am unsure if he is still sending those out.

4) Please be patient! I received my request back in a week, but that is not always the case! I have seen some playbills take months, once in a blue moon maybe even a year or two to come back! Actors are VERY busy and they respond to fan mail in their own spare time! Please do not try to harass them to reply and be polite when you send your request! We are NOT entitled to any signed playbills, especially when a donation is not required! 

If anyone has any questions on how to receive a signed playbill from Aaron (or anyone in general), please do not hesitate to ask on this post or through DMs! I am happy to answer any questions I failed to address in this post. I hope this helps!!",cloudys2,21,47,0.91

Relatedly, is it more prestigious to star in a new show (higher risk of the show failing but also higher chance of recognition through awards) and does this affect the ability of older shows to retain big names?

126,Girl from the North Country Review!,115vbi5,"Hi everyone!
I saw Girl from the North Country tonight and was somewhat horrified by the content!
While the cast was stunning and their production was hauntingly beautiful, I was shocked that there appears to be no others that hold my opinion that the musical is incredibly ableist and offensive!
Thus I wrote my own review!

Despite the clear discontinuity between the music and the writing, and the lack of clarity and meaning to the work, the play is disgustingly ableist and harmful to the disabled community. While I struggle to believe that a neurotypical man can write a neurodivergant character with any authenticy, I am more fearful of the fact that McPherson pens a character made of nothing more than dangerous stereotypes. For a great deal of neurotypicals, the only education they receive regarding disability stems from the media. The problem with this, however, is that the media disproportionately presents intellectually disabled men as violent and threatening (and, conversely, intellectually disabled women as infantile and innocent), particularly towards women, with this play being one of the worst for this that I have had the pain of reading. Not only is it implied that Elias murders a women, but he comes close to murdering his father, before being passed off as a burden, and murdered himself by said father. While I wish that I could claim that this was done to raise awareness and foster social justice, it was simply insensitive and yet another media forum to perpetrate dangerous myths that pose disabled people as a threat, and the solution as eugenics and genocide. Nevertheless, McPherson manages to make it worse: Elias is given one song, a dream sequence, now dead and an innocent angel, clothed in white, and the play moves on. I am disgusted by the normalising of this plot, and the continuation of Steinbeck's Lennie in a renowned play that appears to do no wrong, and a misguided playwright who could benefit from a discussion with the community he is harming and the explicit ideals he appears to hold.",Sunshine1604,2,1,0.5

130,Social media influencers and content creators?,115l6dm,"Disclaimer: This isn’t meant to be a hate thread about anyone, just a conversation.

What are everyone’s thoughts on all of these influencers and content creators gaining more ground in theatre? I just saw a TikTok from a well-known influencer trying to pursue theatre (even though most of what they post appears to be a complaint even if it’s said nicely) which got me thinking about what impact they’re having so I figured I would bring the conversation to the table.

I personally feel like there’s a difference between content creators (people who just post things related to the field but do more education and/or have fun) and influencers (people who think their opinions matter more than they do and are always posting them to seek validation). I’m not sure if anyone else differentiates between them, but I do.

I dislike the impact of influencers specifically, especially when they try and pass off their opinion as fact, spread misinformation… or better yet, constantly criticize the very industry in which they’re desperate to be a part of but can’t find anything positive to say. I feel like this is so dangerous especially when they have tons of followers, many of whom are quite young and don’t yet know better.

There’s always going to be things you don’t like and while I’m not saying people shouldn’t have these conversations (because there are lots of things that *do* need to be talked about), what’s the point of being in this industry if everything that comes out of your mouth is a complaint? 

As for the content creators, I absolutely love that they’re using their platform to connect with others, have fun, and open the floor for meaningful discussions about the state of the industry. It’s a shame that the more productive people tend to have less influence than the ones more worried about feeding an ego or algorithm.

Right from the opening, this cast knows exactly the kind of show they’re putting on. Does anyone recall the Real Princesses of New Jersey from So Random? ( someone please get this reference) ? Anyway, the ensemble is full of energy and fully lead into the campiness this show needs to survive! Then there’s the leads. 
    Carolee Carmello as the Stepmother steals the show EVERY single time she’s on stage whether it’s her spouting innuendos ( no spoilers YET but she has one of my absolute favorite lines referring to a “ champagne bottle” ) or her operatic hilarious duet with Grace McLean’s Queen who has certain strange desires of her own ( it’s too gross to write here but feel free to ask 😅)! Jordan Dobson is incredibly endearing as Sebastian and is incredibly impressive. Then there’s Linedy , Bad Cinderella herself . The singles they released and the 30 second video did her absolutely no Justice. The heart she brought to this role and her VOCALS made her MORE than capable to lead this show to success.

142,Bad Cinderella 1st Preview Review,1156zug,"Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella meets Once Upon a Mattress (but not as good as either).


Okay so the plot of Act I is basically just OG Cinderella plus the Queen from Once Upon a Mattress (down to thirsting over her prince son).  Act II at least varies the plot of Cinderella a bit though in a very predictable manner (and I think &Juliet executes a similar plot better).


The most confusing thing about the Cinderella character is that the other characters dislike her for not caring about beauty and being rebellious, but at the same time her family just wants her to clean and serve like in every other Cinderella story so like why would they be mad at her for not caring about beauty???  It felt like they wanted it to be both (she chooses to be a rebel but she also is an outcast not of her choosing) and it muddles the story.  


The comedy is the worst thing about the show and takes what could have been a fun, campy show like &Juliet and makes it a slog at times.  It’s all very 2000s and filled with imo unfunny over the top sexual innuendos.  


The costumes are incredible throughout the show.  I also thought the sets and lighting in Act II were really well done and felt magical.  The choreography is also upbeat and fun like &Juliet.  I really enjoyed the opening number, the number with all the muscle-y men and the Queen, the ball (Act II opener), and the dance party number towards the end.


The song lyrics are super cringey and most of the songs are forgettable.  I enjoyed the opening number song.  And while there are definitely too many boring ballads, the ballad that the Prince sings in Act I gave me goosebumps.  The full orchestra swelling behind him as he sang was just incredible.

148,Musical of the Week,114uytw,"Musical: *Miss Saigon*

Music: Claude-Michel Schönberg

Lyrics: Alain Boublil & Richard Maltby Jr 

Book: Alain Boublil & Claude-Michel Schönberg

Premise (per Wikipedia): *Miss Saigon* “is based on Giacomo Puccini’s 1904 opera *Madame Butterfly*, and similarly tells the tragic tale of a doomed romance involving an Asian woman abandoned by her American lover. The setting of the plot is relocated to 1970s Saigon during the Vietnam War, and *Madame Butterfly*'s story of marriage between an American lieutenant and a geisha is replaced by a romance between a United States Marine and a seventeen-year-old South Vietnamese bargirl.”

*Miss Saigon* premiered in the West End in 1989, where it was nominated for 4 Olivier Awards, winning 2 (including Best Actress for Lea Salonga). It transferred to Broadway in 1991, receiving 11 Tony nominations, winning 3 (again, Best Actress for Lea Salonga). 

*Miss Saigon* is steeped in controversy, from copyright violations to accusations of racism and misogyny in the writing to the casting of white actors as Vietnamese characters. There’s even a Wikipedia page titled “Miss Saigon Controversy”. 

There is a proshot of the 2014 London production, starring Eva Noblezada. It is available on BroadwayHD. 

Here are some questions to give you ideas of what to talk about / what to look for as you listen to the album, but feel free to talk about whatever stands out to you about the musical. 

- What was your favorite part of the musical? What was your least favorite?

- Which song has stuck with you the most?

- What surprised you most about this musical?

- Did this musical remind you of any other musicals?

- How did it impact you? Do you think you'll remember it in a few months or years? Would you ever consider re-watching it? Why or why not?

- Which characters did you like best? Which did you like least? Which character did you relate to, or empathize with, the most?

- Are there any areas you wished the musical had elaborated upon further?

If only I were a rich (wo)man with a mega tax refund, I'd buy us ALL the tickets but alas the budget and schedule can accommodate probably 3 shows and a ticket for 1. 

So, (help) find me a match of my own (please)?

Some of my considerations have been strongly influenced by praises you have all shared in the comments + my pure love of male vocals (Platt, Tveit. Groban). 

Side bar - I already bought a Phantom ticket, I'm hopeful to catch 2 more shows.

Here's the list I've gone back & forth on w/context:

* **Some Like It Hot** \- y'all said it was a fun spectacle and I like fun!
* **&Juliet** \- Should it be seen on Broadway or wait for it to tour? Max Martin's hits were the soundtrack to my youth and I love a jukebox musical (gasp, I know, controversy on this sub). 
* **Moulin Rouge** \- I saw this on tour, LOVED IT. Conner Ryan as Christian +++. Aaron Tveit is ++++++ but I didn't love the Satine vocals for OBC, on tour and I saw feedback on Ashley's performance. The plot line is meh but entertainment factor top notch. Still worth it for Aaron? 
* **Leopoldstadt** \- this is complete divergent from a lot on this list but many of you have talked about how moved they were after seeing it. And I'm in need of a good cry. 
* **Parade** \- I love Ben Platt. That's really all I got. Maybe another good cry in the works, too?
* **Sweeney Todd** \- It's Josh Groban & Annaleigh! It's Sondheim! It's Director Tommy Kail!  Johanna is a top song for me but can't say it's my favorite Sondheim \*critique based purely off the Burton movie... I'm devastated I missed Company.

Or maybe there is a show I overlooked?

A friend and I are looking to get tickets for when Hadestown comes to Seattle next November and I'm hoping to get some opinions on which of the following ticket options would be best:

Anyone familiar with the theater:

\- From what I can tell, the back of the mezzanine seems pretty far back (even the back of the orchestra does as well). With a smaller, intimate show like Hadestown, is it worth going up to the $157 tickets? If the $91 will be fine, we'll do those lmao

Additionally, a more general question – these tickets are from StubHub, which I've heard decent things about? The only reason I'm nervous is cause the tickets haven't gone on sale from the [Seattle Theater Group](https://www.stgpresents.org/calendar/14001/hadestown) yet.

I’ve also heard that audience members have gotten a lot more disrespectful? Any advice for deescalating the situation if someone is being loud during the show? I’m not super worried about issues during Sweeney Todd, but I’m going to Moulin Rouge on a Saturday night and I’m nervous about people singing along lol.

248,Musical of the Week,110q0hp,"Musical: *The Last Five Years*

Music: Jason Robert Brown

Lyrics: Jason Robert Brown 

Book: Jason Robert Brown 

Premise (per Wikipedia): *The Last Five Years * “explores a five-year relationship between Jamie Wellerstein, a rising novelist, and Cathy Hiatt, a struggling actress. The show uses a form of storytelling in which Jamie's story is told in chronological order (starting just after the couple have first met) and Cathy's story is told in reverse chronological order (beginning the show at the end of the marriage). The characters do not directly interact except for a wedding song in the middle as their timelines intersect.”

*The Last Five Years* premiered off-Broadway in 2002. 

There is a film adaptation starring Jeremy Jordan and Anna Kendrick, which I believe you can watch on YouTube. There is also a proshot of the 2020 London production on BroadwayHD. 

Here are some questions to give you ideas of what to talk about / what to look for as you listen to the album, but feel free to talk about whatever stands out to you about the musical. 

- What was your favorite part of the musical? What was your least favorite?

- Which song has stuck with you the most?

- What surprised you most about this musical?

- Did this musical remind you of any other musicals?

- How did it impact you? Do you think you'll remember it in a few months or years? Would you ever consider re-watching it? Why or why not?

- Which characters did you like best? Which did you like least? Which character did you relate to, or empathize with, the most?

- Are there any areas you wished the musical had elaborated upon further?

Both received a standing ovation. I searched standing ovation and the end of the definition says, ""extraordinary performances of particularly high acclaim."" I am sure that no matter how good or bad a performance is it will get a standing ovation, even if it is undeserving.

I know that enjoyment of a show is subjective, and some will find a show much better than others, but the performance of Hamilton I saw wasn't even close to a ""extraordinary performance of particularly high acclaim,"" by any stretch of the imagination.

262,April Show Advice!,10zltn8,"Hey hey! Please delete if not allowed.

I'm going to be in NYC for 5 days in april, and I've looked and there's four slots where shows are playing, but six shows I want to see. I need some advice as to which you'd recommend for me! I'm travelling from Australia so I don't get to come back around very often.

The shows I'm stuck between are:

Hadestown - Heard incredible things, know almost nothing about it though. I know it's to do with mythology??

Lion King - Seen it about ten years ago and really loved it. I know it'll be around for a while but I also don't come back often.

MJ - Not a huge MJ fan but I've seen clips and the performances seem to be pretty crazy

Kimberley Akimbo - This is the one I think I'm most keen on, seems to be my vibe?

Shucked - Absolute wild card, but I like country music and it seems wacky so it's grabbed my interest

Funny Girl - Not usually into older shows so it might not be my thing, but I was a HUGE glee fan back in the day, so seeing Lea feels like it'll be all kinds of a childhood bucket list tick.

\-----

To give some context, generally spectacle doesn't do much for me in a show - I'm very attracted to a good plot, good book. Big dance numbers don't really get me going at all - hence why I'm avoiding things like Chicago. I definitely skew towards more contemporary shows and edgier Off-Broadway vibes.

I'm also seeing Little Shop and Play That Goes Wrong on this trip, they have a show in a unique time slot so I've been able to slip them in additionally! If there's any shows that you feel I've missed, especially off-broadway and off-off broadway things that'll grab my attention also feel free to shout those out - they're harder to find!

To give some context on other musicals, my favourite show of all time is Come From Away, by a huge margin. From there, my other favourites are Wicked (I'm skipping this because it's playing in Sydney soon, so I can save myself a slot!), Fun Home, Dear Evan Hansen, Spelling Bee, Heathers, School of Rock, Next to Normal, Matilda, Urinetown, Bare, Avenue Q.",tmrd96,10,3,0.64

INCREDIBLE)… I see shows often and honestly, the last few shows I’ve seen have been plays and had more, idk, niche? refined audiences? (ie the Collaboration, Pictures from Home, Between Riverside and Crazy… less touristy shows) so I knew the audience tonight would be interesting, considering this show is not only a musical by itself, but has more of a tourist draw, but I secretly hoped, going on a Thursday when Julie Benko was advertised as playing Fanny, not Lea Michele (this isn’t about her or that controversy at all), it might be a better audience… so I get there and the four women on my left are already tipsy, which, fine, live your life, but THEY WERE LISTENING TO THE SOUNDTRACK AND REHEARSING LYRICS FOR DON’T RAIN ON MY PARADE TO SING ALONG… that was strike one… next was the lady in front of me, already back on her phone and texting before the overture had even ended… I’m not even starting on all the late entries, but next was the lady eating pretzels through the second half of act one loudly (why is anything in a chip bag or cellophane sold in a Broadway theater?!?)… last thing to almost tip me over was the lady who tried to play Barbara Streisand as Fanny Brice at volume like 342 on her phone for her son in law as act two started but thankfully an usher caught that… and that’s not even to mention the people talking at intermission about how they “loved Lea… but she was shorter than she looked on Glee” \*face palm\*… all in all, just needed to complain for a moment… still loved the show, the cast, the set, the production value, but I just can’t get over some audiences these days! Anytime I go to a musical, or a more touristy play like Piano Lesson or Leopoldstadt or A Christmas Carol, I'm just stunned at what people think is appropriate behavior as an audience member! I didn't pay all this money to listen to you talk or hear your phone ring over and over! But as a note, mad props to the ushers who def have to work overtime (and were tonight) to keep that audience in check so if any of y’all at the August Wilson theater (and honestly any theater but special shout-out to them and the New Amsterdam cause wow, even on a weeknight a couple of months ago the ADULTS in the Aladdin audience were ROUGH) are reading this, hats off to you… y’all are killing it!",hhickel18,18,13,0.68

The second act begins; Eddie does 90 seconds of the second act and realizes the AC is still running.

On this episode of Breaking the Curtain, we're joined by the insanely talented and lovely Bradley Gibson and Isabelle McCalla who star as Hercules and Meg in the upcoming Paper Mill Playhouse production of *Hercules!* 

The inspired Disney animated film is now a mythical new musical adventure. HERCULES is the divinely funny story of an honest-to-Zeus hero on a quest to discover who he is and where he belongs. Is love a possibility too? *Oh, Hades, yes!*The roof-raising score by Alan Menken and David Zippel features all the hits you love from the film, including the Oscar-nominated song “Go The Distance,” as well as “Zero to Hero” and “I Won’t Say (I’m in Love),” along with new songs written for the stage. The show features a new book by Kwame Kwei-Armah (artistic director of London’s Young Vic) and Tony Award® winner Robert Horn (Tootsie), and direction by Obie Award-winning Lear deBessonet. This cheeky, Greeky MUSE-ical earned a New York Times’ Critic’s Pick for its original Public Theater production in Central Park, with the *New York Post* cheering it’s “wise-cracking, heartfelt and emotionally rich.” And that’s the gospel truth!

Hercules runs at Paper Mill Playhouse from Feb 16th - March 19th, 2023. Purchase your tickets today!

Harry potter: Kind of shocked this only got a handful of people. Maybe the audience was fatigued from a long show or the performances took a back seat to the technology. 

Aladdin: Same sporadic thing here. I thought from seeing this on tour people would go wild when the genie came up for his bow but it was not the same here. I wonder if people are just so used to this show they are less impressed. 

Kimberly Akimbo: Pretty much an immediate standing o. I wonder if new material and low expectations contribute to more satisfaction here. 

Some like it hot: This was a pretty common standing o that happened when the main leads came out for bows. 

Phantom: It's closing so the response was mostly a standing o. I think the cast right before the pandemic was significantly stronger though. I just was not as impressed as I have been on previous visits. I think the response was actually bigger the last time I saw it.

329,Justifying the costs from out of town,10wwl26,"Have any of you who have chosen to do a weekend Broadway trip on a rather tight budget regretted the financial decision in the end? Or was it all you hoped and more?

For context, it’s been a bucket list of mine for awhile to see both Hadestown and Aaron Tveit in a show (N2N came out when I was a high school theatre kid). I haven’t been to a Broadway show in over a decade, and grew up doing theatre from middle school through early professional life until the pandemic, and now after a few years away from it I’ve really got the itch again..

Budget wise, it’s not necessarily like I couldn’t afford it to do a weekend trip, but I’d have to make a few sacrifices as money is a little tight right now. Between a flight, hotel, and ticket costs, it does seem hard to justify for just a Friday-Sunday trip even though it’s been a dream of mine.

Help.,10w77k4,"in what's going to be an amazing spur of the moment trip of a lifetime my mom and I are going to be in NYC for Presidents Day weekend. She's NEVER been to New York and I've really only been when I did something else spontaneous and camped out for this year's Macy's parade. I really fell in love with the city and want her to do the same. 

She gave me my love of music and theater and I want this to be amazing for her. However, like most of us, we are really on a tight budget. So.... we have some decisions to make. 

To start, we already have tickets to see Funny Girl. Now, we do know it's not Lea Michelle but the price was too good to pass up. We're very excited about that. Also, it's not Broadway of course but we are taking in the NY Philharmonic at Lincoln Center. Now comes decision time and I want your help in if I'm on the right path... 

On Monday I'm going to enter all of the lucky seat lotteries to see if we can snag anything. The holiday weekend seems to be a popular time so I'm not holding by breath. I've also entered Ham4Ham. I've seen the tour and twice in Chicago but to be in the Rogers would be amazing. 

My priority is to see if we can win any of the lotteries. Assuming that isn't the case, what should we do next? TXTS? Today Tix? (Seems to have some great prices?)

Likely would be targeting a matinee on Saturday or Sunday. 

I'm very interested in a showstopping musical or something fun from Disney. (I've seen Lion King, but she hasn't (tour). Aladdin looks fun but people talk about the crowd not being good? Not sure what that means? 

For price alone a play seems to be a good choice. To see amazing acting in person pushes me toward Leopoldstadt. A prior reddit post says it'll be amazing down the road to ""say you were there"" because it's that good. I'm also inclined to try to find Hadestown at a reasonable price. Never seen it. 

What else would you suggest? Also the ""Play that goes wrong"" peaks my interest and isn't $100+.

Not sure if anyone knows a phone number directly to the Shubert box office but that’s what I was told when I called

Edit 2: So I am now able to confirm that at least for the Shubert Theatre, the seat is removable for the wheelchair area.

We booked a hotel and showed up before for standing room on that slam dunk sell out I did my research on and asked about at the actual box office. Oh suddenly it is not sold out... well the website still listed the show as sold out as it had for weeks. Well surely it will be sold out by showtime right? Well a box office unwilling to really discount the last few tickets and  not be honest about the actual sold status of the show means apparently not.

Womp Womp surprisingly no one wants to spend 250 plus on a show they thought was sold out day of. I bought tickets on stub hub for around 100 per person.

352,"Update on a ""Help me decide what show to see"" post",10vpm6l,"Hi r/broadway! I [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/zbpy03/help_me_decide_on_a_show_to_see/) two months ago and wanted to post an update because everyone was so helpful and gave very thoughtful advice. 
      
I ultimately decided on Kimberly Akimbo, and we LOVED it. I can't remember ever laughing or crying so much in one show. I was so moved by the ending, and I can't stop thinking about it over a week later! As soon as the curtain closed, my husband and I turned to each other and said, ""That was so good."" I'm recommending it to everyone I know now. Definitely one of the best shows I've ever seen. 
           
The other show we watched that weekend was Hadestown, which was also good, but didn't quite land in the same way for me. Eva was phenomenal and really stole the show for me. Reeve was having a bit of a rough night. His ""la la la""'s sounded good, but the rest of the singing fell a little flat for me. In general, I thought the second act dragged, and Hades and Persephone didn't feel developed enough as characters. But we still enjoyed it overall! 
            
The biggest win was my husband being officially converted to a Broadway fan. This is a guy who had never watched a Broadway show in his life before he met me and thought it was kinda dumb. Now he listens to Broadway cast recordings every day while he works out and is excited to go to more shows!",drzoidburger,1,15,0.8

I do think it might be even cooler with a 5-6 person drumline in the Ladies in Waiting for the show. I think it would add another cool dimension to the music and I’m sure they could do a lot with them on the stage. Obviously they wouldn’t be on everything but even if they were on like 3-4 songs I think it would be super cool.

Funny girl-9.5/10. Amazing show! Lea and Ramin were both great, Altho Ramin’s role doesn’t do his voice justice. Lived up to hype. Very good. 

MJ the Musical-10/10. We are both huge MJ fans, didn’t know a lot about this. Was pissed when I saw we had ANOTHER understudy in the lead role, but he was absolutely incredible.

369,My thoughts on Ride the Cyclone & Sunset Boulevard [DC],10v5kam,"So I am incredibly lucky that I got to see Ride the Cyclone and Sunset Boulevard in DC a week after coming back from NYC. Here are my thoughts if you’re interested:

- Ride the Cyclone: a really fun and morbid one act show, it was expertly crafted to make every character three dimensional. You can’t help rooting for each of the character. The Arena Stage cast felt like a family, and I had a great time. I saw this show after the first Jane Doe left to prep for Parade on Broadway, and I have to say that the second Jane Doe was phenomenal. I definitely hope they can bring this back to NYC one day!

- Sunset Boulevard: I was not going to see this after being disappointed by Phantom last weekend, but saw Derek Klena’s performance on Tiktok, and bought tickets right away. Derek was phenomenal, and Stephanie J. Block as Norma was something I never thought I needed until I saw her become Norma. I thought Stephanie was too young to play Norma, but any doubt left my mind the second she stepped on to the stage. Both leads were incredible, and I hope this show gets a transfer next year.",TDG_1993,21,21,0.96

As for the music, after the opening number and Skid Row, it takes a backseat in favor of the plant, which makes sense, but I think it may have awakened my childhood fear of puppets. But it makes me feel better knowing that we just had Beetlejuice too.

375,Intentional breaking/corpsing,10utf5z,"It has been discussed many times in this sub, but the current Music Man production has a moment where Hugh and Sutton accidentally-on-purpose break the fourth wall and laugh as themselves, not their characters, letting the audience in on their little inside joke after Sutton pushes Hugh a little too hard. The crowd goes wild because that’s the magic of live theatre, and audiences eat it up thinking they’re witnessing something no other audience will. 

Except the moment is pre-planned, and now you can watch it on this viral tweet: 

https://twitter.com/jessedmcanally/status/1622285188955766785?s=46&t=CAdW1nb0eNdRmaqTJW2H_Q

Responses to this tweet include a bunch of people saying that pre-planned breaking/corpsing/laughing  is a tale as old as time. Is that true? What other productions have intentional moments where the actors *pretend* to break?

I can give you one: in the OBC of The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, the cast has four audience members participate as spellers. The final audience speller is given nonsense words to spell (“caterjunes”), but the cast acts as though the audience member got all the words right against their expectations and the actors all kind of break down on stage. The pretext is “this audience member has outsmarted the spelling bee game, what do we do now??” But this is also part of the show.

383,Bat Out Of Hell - Australian tour,10udpj9,"So. Last night I saw the Perth leg of the Australian arena tour of Bat out of Hell. 24 hours later, I’m still thinking about it… and not in a good way.

Normally when I see a show that’s not to my liking (hellooooo Cats), there are still parts of the show that I find redeemable.  This is the first time I’ve walked out of a show with absolutely *nothing* positive to say.

I’m genuinely trying to understand if it is either a) because I’m not intimately familiar with Steinman and Meatloaf’s music, or because b) limitations due to the Arena conversion of the show. Either way, I can’t find much positive to say. I’d love to hear thoughts of those who have seen the more traditional stagings or the show.

Stray thoughts:
* Initially I couldn’t decide if the acting was poor or the script was poor (or both). But I think in the end blame lies with the book. Everybody spoke with a strange, wooden, over-acting style - over-the-top for even a musical.
* The cameras were distracting - the camera people were dressed brightly and distracted from the performances. From a technical perspective, it didn’t really work for me either - performers directed their attention toward the camera instead of each other, which made for strange dynamics when characters were interacting with each other.  Then the cameras disappeared for the last third of the show.
* Dialogue and plot were woeful at best. Characters routinely stopped to spout stilted monologues from existing lyrics, but as someone not familiar with them…it fell flat to me from a dramatic perspective.
* Lack of sets - to be expected from an Arena tour somewhat, but it made the plot significantly harder to follow. Reading the Wikipedia summary afterwards, I realised how many plot points I missed.

I guess I walked into the show expecting something along the lines of WWRY, but what I walked out of.. well, I am glad I didn’t pay full price.  Would love to hear thoughts of others who have seen it!",tiktoktic,8,6,1.0

I just got back from seeing the Boleyn Tour in St. Louis, and it was my second time seeing this production. The first time I saw the show (last week) when it came to the final gasp in All You Wanna Do, the audience was completely caught of guard and sat in stunned silence for probably about ten seconds until Howard made a little joke to break the tension. It was a really powerful and well-earned moment. 

During my second time seeing it, the same actress, Aline Mayagoitia, performed the song almost exactly the same, I felt the exact same emotions in watching it, but once she hit the final gasp, the audience *immediately* burst into applause and cheers. 

It was really jarring to me! I was one of the few who didn’t immediately cheer. Not because she didn’t deserve it, but because I was so wrapped in the song again and the ending truly is so brutal.

395,Sunset BOULevard Review!,10ti3jh,"Had the pleasure of seeing Sunset Blvd last night at the Kennedy Center. Shockingly good. I have loved this score and movie for over a decade so enjoyed seeing how it worked as a live musical. It's a terrific musical, and think it has a great combination of score and plot compared to some of ALW's other shows. 

Stephanie: Surprisingly nuanced. Norma is campy, funny, scary, sentimental, and cunning all in one, and she really hit all those notes. She made sure to never lose the crazy of Norma, but also had enough warmth and charm that at times you do root for her. Stephanie's ""with one look"" was sensational. The final belt was like a scream into the universe it was so forceful. Her book scenes were also terrific, and there was not one moment where she wasn't completely immersed. ""As if we Never said Goodbye"" was good but not as strong as ""with one look"" personally. She acted this song out and it was amazing. However, thought the bridge could have musically had better phrasing. I love it when they do the Betty phrasing and hold the ""home"" longer that ""at last"" during the bridge. Her final scenes were scary at capturing her delusion. 

Derek: Hard role. Think his overall appearance could have been a little more shabby. He's supposed to be a struggling writer and why is his hair always nicely pulled back? A little more messy in appearance and clothes would have sold it better at the beginning. His singing and comedy was strong but would have appreciated a little more grit and maybe darkness to his performance. Not much cynicism surprisingly.  

Auli'i: Very strong acting. She has a bit of a lisp or unique voice when she acts which works great for Betty. She helped ground the musical and thought her acting was sublime. Her voice was very pretty but not very operatic. Overall, she made a sometimes vague character work even if the voice is not your typical soprano sound. I would always trade acting for voice and she sold the hell out of this. 

Nathan: Great voice and acting. This is not a flashy role but he did well with it. 

Production and direction: I loved the set and use of projections. However, some of the rear stuff was kind of hidden by the stairs from my POV. It's not a deal breaker because nothing really happens back there that is terribly important. However, it was noticeable. Also, for some strange reason there was a camera positioned on stage right in front of Betty for half of ""Too much in love to Care"". They used it before the song but should have pushed it off during it. However a lot of wonderful directing touches like having Norma watch herself getting weighed, the use staircases, and camera equipment as cars. 

Score and book: Amazing score and probably ALW's most well rounded score combo with plot. The music always felt appropriate to the story. Enjoyed the jazzy pieces as much as the classic stirring swing pieces. It's such a dizzying score and loved hearing it live. There were 4 keyboards in the orchestra with 17 other musicians. I'm used to hearing the 60+ musician concert version of this show so it sounded a bit thin at times. 

Overall, an incredible time and what a great production.",circo1200,7,30,0.97
396,Why does everyone treat Shrek the Musical like it's the worst thing in the world?,10thln3,"TW - AN UNCOMMON OPINION 

This musical is literally the perfect message of accepting who you are. The characters have so much emotion and stay in character, even Pinnochio, with the scratchy and slightly higher voice. Throughout the musical, it can be seen that it is an amazing re-interpretation of the movie, and even has some jokes that weren't featured in the movie that perhaps only the adults would get.  

 It also combines Gingy's extremely screechy voice to create humorous scenes due to the audience feeling the emotion. The actors also had amazing voices that made me seriously think they were the characters in the movie at first. I also love Pinnochio's tense emotion building up to him getting upset about not being a 'real boy' during 'Freak Flag', which could make adult viewers possibly relate towards him, because they're judged for being unique, but then as well the audience learning it's alright to be different, Pinnochio and Humpty raise a rally in the group of freaks to raid the town of Duloc and stand up to Lord Farquaad. 

 As well as the characters, the plot of the musical is unique and throws in many fart jokes. Many, many fart jokes. Especially in the song (I Got You Beat), where Shrek and Fiona are arguing about who had the most traumatic childhood, which sounds funny on a blank slate.

The fairy tale creatures, travelling towards a landfill, disagree over whether they deserve this. In between this, Pinnochio suggests they wait for something to come to them, 'because that is what fairytale creatures do', and after this, he starts to talk about how his cricket once told him, who is Jiminy Cricket, but then the witch interrupts him, claiming if he was so smart, he would have seen that windshield. This proves that Jiminy Cricket is dead, and with his father disowns him for money, he now has no one. Because of this, Pinnochio storms off to the side of the stage, and yells, 'None of this would have happened if I were a real boy!' (PINNOCHIO I'M SO SORRY), and due to this, silences the other fairytale creatures. He then adds, 'Why can't I be a real boy?' (YOU SOUNDED SO UPSET, POOR BOY) After this, Gingy and the puppeteer (Sugar Plum Fairy) sneak up behind him and yells, 'Listen up puppet!', giving him a fright (sending the poor suitcase flying), which is then where the song 'Freak Flag' begins. 

 (MAINLY) Gingy, Mama Bear and Papa Bear encourage the creatures to  gather new confidence and strength in themselves as they declare they will raise their ""Freak Flag"" high against their tormentors, and the gist of the song is that 'What makes us special makes us strong.' This means that no matter how unique you are, you should embrace it and become proud of it. 

 You might ask, ""WhY aRe YoU foCuSIng On THe fReaKS So mUcH? It wAsn'T AboUT TheM!""   And to that, I say, they got the message of the musical along better than any other characters. Plus, I found that the few songs they were in, seemed to interest mea lott more than some of the other songs. Especially Pinnochio. I will not disclose why I like Pinnochio so much. Take your guesses, but I won't tell you.  (P.S - ARGUE WITH ME. PINNOCHIO SOLOS EVERY SONG HE'S IN. CHANGE MY MIND.)",isabelle_is_bell,21,0,0.42

398,Falling Down the Rabbit Hole Trying to Find a Song,10t86tw,"I recently was talking to someone about a musical I was so sure was Kiss Me Kate, but when I tried finding the youtube video of the performance i just couldn't! At this point, since it seems I'm wrong, there's really not much to go off of and im lost.


Here's all I remember:

 Firstly, there's someone who I think is Brent Barret, singing to a woman about how much he loves her, till another woman comes through the door. On the stage, there are two doors to show how he moves the first woman to another room while talking to the other. At the end he ends up sandwiched in between both doors, trying to keep them closed. Secondly, i think this was performed on a show like the Today show, or Good Morning America. My third point is even vaguer, but I feel like he was also calling out one of the women's names in a very sing-songy voice (duh). Something like, ""Diaaaaaanaa!"". Harder to explain since that could be sung out in a bunch of ways, but I thought I should add it in anyways.


Pleaseeee someone tell me they know what im talking about 😭 I also feel like there's a slight chance there might be “Guy”, or “Gentleman” in the title, and has nothing to do with Kiss Me Kate.

399,Flew from California to see Phantom and missed the show. Advice?,10t3t7n,"I'm not looking for judgement right now, I know I messed up, and I feel terrible enough.

My husband and I took a redeye last night and had a whole weekend's worth of shows to see. The whole reason we came was to see Phantom before it closed on Broadway. We spent about $700 on tickets to the show alone (orchestra seats, near the front).

We were both really struggling to stay awake at dinner so thought it would be good to take an hour power nap before the show. We set several alarms on his phone, passed out and woke up at 9:40pm to find that his phone was dead - wasnt low battery before we went to sleep, mind you, just randomly died - and we had slept through the entire show.

We're going to the Majestic box office tomorrow to see if there are any Sunday tickets left but I' not hopeful. Or we could extend our trip to Tuesday and try to catch a Monday night show?

We're both devastated and are not thinking clearly right now. I honestly have no idea what our options are. Im shaking and trying to fight back tears. If anyone has any advice, please let us know.

*UPDATE*

First of all - really overwhelmed by everyone's responses. You all helped me feel much better about this crappy situatuon.

So we went to the box office and unfortunately because the show is closing, they couldn't do anything about getting us tickets for another night, but they were really kind and apologetic.

We did manage to extend our trip to Tuesday, and got tickets for $200/each. Left orchestra, row C - pretty far to the side but I'm still really happy. Obviously our wallets are hurting but we'll make it work. I'm just happy to get to see one of my favorite shows in its original run.

401,Musical of the Week,10t3fgq,"Musical: *Jekyll & Hyde*

Music: Frank Wildhorn 

Lyrics: Frank Wildhorn, Leslie Bricusse, Steve Cuden

Book: Leslie Bricusse

Premise: *Jekyll & Hyde* is a musical based loosely on the 1886 novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* by Robert Lewis Stevenson. The story follows scientist Henry Jekyll’s experiment to separate good from evil. 

*Jekyll & Hyde* premiered on Broadway in 1997. It was nominated for 4 Tony Awards. 

Here are some questions to give you ideas of what to talk about / what to look for as you listen to the album, but feel free to talk about whatever stands out to you about the musical. 

- What was your favorite part of the musical? What was your least favorite?

- Which song has stuck with you the most?

- What surprised you most about this musical?

- Did this musical remind you of any other musicals?

- How did it impact you? Do you think you'll remember it in a few months or years? Would you ever consider re-watching it? Why or why not?

- Which characters did you like best? Which did you like least? Which character did you relate to, or empathize with, the most?

- Are there any areas you wished the musical had elaborated upon further?

405,What would the acting winners look like if categories were split based on genre than gender?,10sw2af,"Based on recent conversations, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at the past ten years of the Tonys and try to guess potential winners if the awards were split into comedy and drama rather than based on gender. To try to be more realistic, I chose winners based on actual Tony results and overall show/performance reception, both for other awards and critics' responses, even if it went against my personal preference. I also only did the lead categories but let me know if you would like me to do the same for any other categories as well. Please note this is just a thought exercise and not an argument in either direction. 



**2022:**

**Drama: Myles Frost – MJ**

**Comedy: Hugh Jackman – The Music Man**


Obviously, with Myles and Joaquina Kalukango being the actual winners, I had to pick one of them. I ended up going with Myles as his show was the most rewarded new musical.


You can easily make the case for Billy Crystal and Rob McClure in Comedy but I went with Hugh because of how much of a money-making TMM was and the fact it received the most nominations out of the three. 


**2021/2020:**

**Drama: Adrienne Warren – Tina**

**Comedy: N/A**


Adrienne was an easy choice to make as she would have been a competitive winner even in a non-covid-impacted year. 

The Lightning Thief was the only eligible show that would be considered a comedy and if they weren’t nominating Chris McCarrell for Best Actor, they certainly wouldn't give him an award. 


**2019:**

**Drama: Stephanie J. Block – The Cher Show**

**Comedy: Santino Fontana – Tootsie**


The actual winners, easy enough


**2018:**

**Drama: Katrina Lenk – The Band's Visit**

**Comedy: Ethan Slater – SpongeBob SquarePants**


Katrina is the easy choice here as she would have won no matter what category she was in. 

Of the actual nominees, I think you can easily place Ethan, Taylor Louderman, Harry Hadden-Paton, and Lauren Ambrose in Comedy. Ethan won both the Drama Desk and Outer Critics plus I can see the two from MFL splitting their votes. 


**2017:**

**Drama: Ben Platt – Dear Evan Hansen**

**Comedy: Bette Midler – Hello, Dolly!**


Again just picking the actual winners


**2016:**

**Drama: Cynthia Erivo – The Color Purple**

**Comedy: Laura Benanti – She Loves Me**


Drama was really hard as both Cynthia and Leslie Odom Jr. were incredibly deserving winners. While Hamilton was such a tour de force that year, I think LMM would have split some of the votes ultimately giving Cynthia the win.

She Loves Me was better received and awarded than School of Rock (the other comedy nominee that year) and between Laura and Zachary Levi, I think she easily wins.


**2015:**

**Drama: Michael Cerveris – Fun Home**

**Comedy: Kristin Chenoweth – On the Twentieth Century**


Kelli O'Hara’s win has always been seen as a somewhat “career win” and up against Michael’s lauded performance, I think he takes it easily. 

IMO Kristen was robbed so I think in a comedy-only category, it would be hers to lose. 


**2014:**

**Drama: Neil Patrick Harris – Hedwig and the Angry Inch**

**Comedy: Jefferson Mays – A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder**


Hedwig won Best Revival and NPH has the name recognition so I think it would go in his favor over Jessie Mueller. 

An actor from the Best Musical winner is the obvious choice for Comedy and Jefferson Mays is the standout of that show.


**2013:**

**Drama: Bertie Carvel – Matilda the Musical**

**Comedy: Billy Porter – Kinky Boots**


Anyone who follows award shows knows that the lines between comedy and drama are incredibly blurred, and the 2012-2013 Broadway season definitely makes a case for that as you can make the argument for multiple shows being either. For the sake of this exercise though, I’m placing Kinky Boots in Comedy and Matilda in Drama, and considering how much it was a race between those two shows that Tony season, awarding an actor from each makes sense.



Based on my hypothetical winners, along gender lines, it breaks down as 10 men and 7 women (To my knowledge none of the actors I listed identify as non-binary but if I missed anyone, please feel free to let me know). Not the worst ratio but still leans more in favor of men.",slothbaby30,7,1,0.5

2) Les Mis: having performed in the show in school (in 2017), I went to see the West End version (with the original staging).

431,"Thoughts on seeing Phantom for the second (and final) time, Hadestown cast change, etc.",10rzoqo,"**Phantom of the Opera:**

Phantom was my first ever Broadway show when I was younger and it genuinely changed my life and got me interested in seeing shows. Seeing it for the second (and final!!) time this week was incredible. It's actually so funny that I forgot how legitimately creepy/stalkerish Phantom is (how he just hides and crawls out of stage props unannounced) because I really romanticized him as a kid, LOL. The soundtrack is the best and this will always be my favorite in my heart. 

I saw Julia Udine, Ben Crawford, John Riddle as the leads -- I enjoyed John Riddle's performance, I actually found myself actually giving a shit about Raoul for once. BUT the first Phantom I saw --- James Barbour --- couldn't be topped, and he's still my favorite (Crawford was a lot shorter, basically Christine's height, and I thought there was not as much chemistry).

I'm so sad this show is closing, but at least I have the movie, which I also love.

&#x200B;

**Hadestown:**

Last summer I saw Patrick Page and T Oliver Reid still as Hades/Hermes; and then more recently I saw it (twice!), with Tom Hewitt and Lillias White both times.

Patrick Page was such a standout and I'm so glad I got to see him, I didn't even know he was leaving that role when I saw it! I did find Tom Hewitt's 'higher' singing a little funny at first (esp in Hey Little Songbird), but it very quickly grew on me and he looks like he has so much fun with the character/is really making it his own. By the second performance I was very excited to see him. Lillias White was also great and I liked the sort of intimate/mother-like figure she presents to Orpheus.

Reeve Carney- omg. I had no idea who he was/didn't know that he wasn't well-liked when I first saw the show, but my mom and I came out of that (just btwn ourselves) agreeing that 'the guy who plays Orpheus' was the weak link of the cast, and my mom even wondered if he had gotten the role through nepotism or something, LOL. It was painful to watch him sing and act, sounded very different from the Youtube recordings. I did like that he was playing an awkward/nervous role as the lead, but then the whole time I thought it was going to be an act that he would shed halfway through once he started to like believe in himself and finally reveal the angelic voice gifted to him by the gods, but that didn't happen(?), and then I started to wonder if he was legitimately trying to potray Orpheus as autistic?? So overall I was confused. I definitely think Hadestown would have even more weight/be more popular if he was swapped out.

I was super impressed by Eva Noblezada's vocals but was kind of turned off by her (seeming) lack of effort/tiredness, opting out of high notes like five different times through the show. I'm lucky to live near NYC and be financially stable enough/get opportunities to see these shows but I feel very bad for the audience members who might've traveled/saved up/whatever to see the show, I felt they deserved better.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It’s small theater (Linda Gross) and a limited run so I was little nervous about getting tickets for the few free days I have available during the run as I’m not available today at noon to jump online. 

I noticed they have membership options to have access to buy during the presale, which ends today, but those are usually very pricey for many other theaters. However, Atlantic Theater Company has a $50 membership (A-tix) option that gets you access to the presale **AND** 20% off tickets to Days of Wine and Roses (for select non-premium seats). So I joined this morning and bought front row tickets for their opening weekend (opening night is sold out) for only $11 more than buying them full price, and that includes the membership, which helps the theater as well. The $11 is very worth it for me not to stress out today trying to book them for a specific date. Plus other perks to the membership (listed below FYI)

If you’re interested in more of their shows this season they also have other good membership options, but this post is really just for those who are looking to book Days of Wine and Roses today before noon

A-TIX:

$50 up front to join. Grants access to purchase 1 discounted ticket to each of our five 2022|2023 productions. ($50 for plays, $60 for musicals). $4.50 per ticket fee added at checkout.

465,Has anyone here seen “Phantom of the Paradise”?,10qvkej,"It’s one of my favorite movie musicals (probably my #2 of all time apart from “The Wizard of Oz”), but I feel like it’s not widely recognized in the musical theatre community, unless you’re from Winnipeg or Paris.

Released in 1974, over a decade before “The Phantom of the Opera” premiered in London and a year before “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” the film is a rock adaptation of the Gaston Leroux story, with heavy elements of “Faust” in the script. It’s dark and bizarre and funny at times, the tone courtesy of its writer-director Brian de Palma, later the director behind “Carrie,” “Scarface,” “The Untouchables” and the first “Mission Impossible” film. 

The song score is by Oscar winner Paul Williams (also composer of “The Muppet Movie” including “The Rainbow Connection”) and features everything from torch ballads to an Alice Cooper pastiche. Williams also co-stars as the antagonist, Swan.

The film wasn’t a huge success upon its release but did play for years and gain a cult following in Winnipeg and Paris (Daft Punk first met at a screening of the movie. No joke.).

Overall, I’m not a huge play person compared to musicals but this show did show me I have to give plays more of a try.

Anyway, I loved it, but I left feeling a certain way about the audience.

I know the show is about to close but so people not know about the nudity in the show at this point? I was thoroughly shocked by how many people gasped when it first came to light. And it wasn’t like a whoop whoop gasp but more like pure surprise.

Second, how do people feel about the cheering and almost cat calling for the nudity? When it happened for Jesse Williams, some woman started whistling and saying get it among other sounds. I didn’t like it since it kinda objectified him and it took me out of the moment of the scene. 

Lastly, I know this comes up a lot, but can we please some talking mid-show? The people behind me were chatting away and it’s especially apparent during a play without a musical number to drown it out.

467,Is laughing loud okay during a play?,10qq7zk,"I went to Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play the other day in broadway.

I was sitting in a second corner row, very close to the stage, and there was a woman right behind me laughing EXTREMELY LOUD and LONG. Like HA-HA-HA-HA!!! Very loud but slowly…

Of course I laugh and chuckle too during a funny scene but this woman would laugh in every slight comic scene when nobody else laughs out loud. It was literally like a artificial laugh from an old sitcom.

Her loud laugh was so annoying to me, I had hard time concentrating on the play because she was laughing loud right behind me once every 2-3 mins.

After long consideration, I’ve decided and during the intermission I asked her very nicely to be a little bit more gentle when laughing. 

She immediately gave me a weird look and asked if I don’t like her laugh. I replied I just want you to be bit more quite. She then said, “Actors love when audience laugh out loud. I know because I am an actor.”

At that point I really didn’t have much to say and she also acted like “whatever” to me. I was very offended too and asked the staff if I was allow to move to empty seat that was bit distant from her. The staff said okay, so I moved and enjoyed the 2nd act. I could still hear her laugh but it didn’t bother me as much since it was distant.

I was wondering whether if it’s okay to laugh that loud during a play. I mean it definitely was not common experience for me. I also had no idea if it’s true that actors love loud audience.

EDIT TO ADD: To everyone saying I shouldn’t get mad for others enjoying themselves… I wouldn’t have been bothered if it really was just natural reaction. However, it sounded like she was doing it somewhat intentionally… Her laugh sounded fake and dramatic (high pitched & slow) and that’s why it bothered so much not only because it’s just “loud”.

I really only bought tickets because “Let’s Be Bad” from SMASH was in this show. I have to say that J. Harrison Ghee was phenomenal! I can’t wait to see them nominated for a Tony’s. The show brilliantly addressed gender identity and race relations, none of which were in the original movie from my knowledge. I am delighted and it definitely is a show to take my parents if only to let them see what a non-binary person feels/thinks! 10/10.

Take Me Out: I also only went in knowing that this play was about a baseball player who comes out as gay, and that there were nudity involved. I have to say that Jesse Tyler Ferguson stole the show! And the acting for the rest were so superb that the nudity really didn’t distract me from anything. I also love that the nudity was not gratuitous, and it does serve a lot of purpose to the show. I’m kind of sad that I didn’t get to see this show with Patrick J. Adams, but that’s only because I’ve had a huge crush on him for a long time! 8/10.

Phantom of the Opera: oof where do I start lol. This show definitely feels dated, and I saw the show the night after the 35th Anniversary show. I wonder if most actors were tired from the celebration? Phantom and Raoul were both played by understudies, but it didn’t really matter. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I gotta say that ALW is definitely overrated, and I hope this show can rest in peace. 3/10.",TDG_1993,57,31,0.74

487,Loved or Hated “The Play That Goes Wrong”: What other comedies do you like/dislike?,10q1abs,"My wife and I went to see it, knowing that it might not be for us, but seeing so many rave reviews we thought we’d give it a try. Unfortunately, it was REALLY not for us, and we actually ended up leaving at intermission. Probably would’ve left earlier but didn’t want to be impolite to the cast.

I’m curious for people who loved it, what other shows do you also love and what shows are not for you? I’m just wondering if there’s any intersection between our sense of humor and yours. 

Here are some of my favorites: Parks and Rec, Ted Lasso, Brooklyn 99, The Good Place, The Office, Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Community, Archer, Arrested Development, Derry Girls, Nathan For You, Modern Family. And in our most recent trip to NYC, I thought Kimberly Akimbo was great and funny.

Some really popular shows that I’ve never understood the appeal of: 3rd Rock From The Sun, Big Bang Theory, anything by Mr. Bean, Will & Grace, and I keep trying Schitts Creek, but just can’t seem to get into it.

493,It’s me…the guy with the son who accidentally bought the Lion King tickets. Here is my update:,10ph83v,"First off, I just want to say I’m so sorry if I annoyed anyone with that post. I understand a few people told me I just had to call the site and my credit card company and that it’s nothing that anyone can actually help me with. So I’m sorry if that post was annoying in any way or if this wasn’t the place to post that - I’m a huge Broadway lover and this is the subreddit I’m the most active in. My son accidentally bought four tickets to The Lion King for $480, and naturally I was freaking lol and wanted to see if anyones been through similar experiences on here and knew how I can undue the mistake. With that being said, I ended up contacting TodayTix today, and they said they were able to cancel my order with no problem at all, and so, I didn’t end up getting charged. It was actually very easy and it all happened in under 10 minutes. I understand people were very doubtful they would actually refund the purchase (I’m surprised it was actually that easy lol). My guess is that it’s a combination of the customer service worker you speak to, and also the status of the tickets. What I mean by that, is the woman I spoke with said she checked the status of the tickets purchased, and told me they had not yet been processed at the box office. This is why it was so easy to cancel the order. Maybe if the date of the showtime was sooner and the box office had already processed the purchase, then this whole thing wouldn’t have been as simple or maybe they wouldn’t have refunded me at all? I’m not really sure.

But anyway, thank you so much to everyone who tried to help in any way with suggestions and similar experiences you guys have gone through. I’m very fortunate I got the money back, because I know not everyone has the same luck with these ticketing companies. I wish the best for anyone who has tried/is trying to get a refund for Broadway tickets.

I saw him two weeks after re-opening and thought he was great, granted I didn’t have the OBC recording burned into my head like I did now but upon seeing it later with Patrick, while Patrick’s voice for Hades is perfect, I actually preferred Tom’s acting in the role.

514,Is it appropriate to ask an audience member to “tone down” their enthusiasm during a performance?,10odnfb,"For context, there is a lady who has purchased tickets to see every single performance of a comedy musical that I am in and she sits front row for every show. She loves the show and she likes to groove along and sing along with the musical numbers. She doesn’t get up and full on dance, but she’s bobbing her head up and down and enjoying herself. She’s paid quite a lot of money to see the show and she’s great for getting the audience energy up. A few of my cast members, however, have stated that they find her distracting, and that she makes it hard for them to focus, or that she’s engaging too much with the cast while they’re performing. So I suppose I just wanna know if it’s appropriate to ask this person to calm down and restrain themselves from showing their enjoyment too much. And I guess I would also want to know who would be responsible for confronting her and telling her this. The Director? The stage manager? Or the front of house manager?

Well, my streak broke last night. I went to see The Appointment yesterday, a satirical 90-minute musical about abortion (yes, you read that right, and while it's not always easy to watch it was actually quite funny in places and did have something interesting to say). 

Unfortunately the people next to me were THE WORST. After the start time but before the show began, the ushers made someone sitting in a single seat move, a man and woman then sat down with the woman in the vacated seat and the man right behind. This did seem to be the house's fault but you'd think given that they weren't sitting next to each other anyway (and these seats were in the last two rows) they might have agreed to simply take different seats. 

During the show, the man drank a bottle or can of something, threw it on the floor and stepped on it, making noise. He also was touching and talking to the woman in front of him constantly. Like, removing her hat and putting it on his own head then replacing it, grabbing her arm and bending it over her head to kiss her hand, touching her hair, massaging her shoulders, etc. And then he took out his bag, rummaged around in it for an age and then commenced to use his phone for the last third of the show; I saw at least one other person doing this too even though the show was just 90 minutes! 

I try to be fair about things and was wondering if the subject matter was sensitive for the woman and if he was trying to support her perhaps. But if so, they should have made sure to get seats next to each other and just held hands quietly or something. As it is, his behavior was disruptive and came across as odd and controlling.

The 2.5 hr play chronicles a Jewish family pre and post holocaust.  I thought the absence of an intermission would feel arduous, but it flew by. I never understood anti-semitism, and I still don’t, but the play does a good job showing how pervasive European anti-semitism was in and how it existed long before Trump, I mean Hitler exploited it. It was also a condemnation of Austria and how easily Austrians and Germans were let off the hook post-war. I appreciate literature that educates us and this play has a lot to teach us.

532,Musical of the Week,10n52db,"Musical: *Aida*

Music: Elton John 

Lyrics: Tim Rice 

Book: Linda Woolverton, Robert Falls, David Henry Hwang

Premise: “*Aida* is a musical based on the 1871 opera of the same name by Giuseppe Verdi. The story is set in the Old Kingdom of Egypt. It follows the title character, a Nubian princess, as her country is enslaved by Egypt.”

*Aida* premiered on Broadway in 2000. It won 4 Tony Awards, including Best Score. 

Here are some questions to give you ideas of what to talk about / what to look for as you listen to the album, but feel free to talk about whatever stands out to you about the musical. 

- What was your favorite part of the musical? What was your least favorite?

- Which song has stuck with you the most?

- What surprised you most about this musical?

- Did this musical remind you of any other musicals?

- How did it impact you? Do you think you'll remember it in a few months or years? Would you ever consider re-watching it? Why or why not?

- Which characters did you like best? Which did you like least? Which character did you relate to, or empathize with, the most?

- Are there any areas you wished the musical had elaborated upon further?

545,"Have you ever yelled for an encore at a Broadway performance, and have you ever been at a Broadway performance where an encore was given?

I think that the ""solemnity"" of the theatre (for me)/theatre etiquette would keep me from yelling for an encore.  Also, as much as I might like one, the process and encore performance would take me out of the story to a degree, and serve as something of an interruption.  Having said that, with the right occasion . . . .

So many performances that I would love to see encored.  Topmost on my list \*today\*:  The Carousel Waltz from Carousel (the opening scene of the show, done in pantomime to the orchestra's performance of the instrumental Carousel Waltz), but specifically from the National Theatre's 1992 London and later Broadway revival of the show, the version in which a full skeletal carousel magically is created on stage, complete with carousel horses rising up and down--a genius of staging.

And then Boyd Gaines' performance of the title song from the 1993 revival of She Loves Me, in which his exuberance at discovering that he is in love is just electrically transmitted to the audience, and reduces his body to shakes and shivers, and joyous song.

Fortunately, video records of each exist.  ",MikermanS,33,0,0.37

The row behind us, who I am pretty sure were 6 people or more together, was an absolutely nightmare and ruined the first act for us in a big big way. Rattling popcorn bags for over AN HOUR. Right in our ears. Several looks back at them did not give them even a hint that they should stop. Mind you, this was in 5th row orchestra. I'm pretty sure every actor on stage could hear it.

Couple that with talking while show was on (I did turn and say ""shut up"" at one point) - and one of them, an older woman who should know better, LOUDLY coughing with no mask and no attempt to cover her mouth. 

At first I moved 4 seats over to avoid the popcorn rattles, but then I was in front of the cougher.

I noticed 4 empty seats on aisle in middle section so at intermission my friend and I grabbed them. Then 2 other women in our row came over and took other empty seats near us. That row of people behind us EMPTIED THE ENTIRE ROW.

I just do not understand people that come to a theater and act like it is their own living room - especially when you are so close to the stage but really it shouldn't matter where you sit. People like that should stay at home in the barn in which they were raised.

Theaters however, should NOT be encouraging this behavior by selling loud packaged snacks for people to disturb everyone around them.

The pay being offered for this? $850 weekly. Now naturally the friend turned down the opportunity and this girl didn't outright name the national tour in her video.

595,Question(s) about Company,10kjgkr,"So I just saw Company in Madrid. Bobby was played by the actor who was Puss ‘n Boots from Shrek… who is 62. They made it his 50th birthday instead of his 30th like in the original which was interesting. The only other version I’ve seen of the show is the recent NYC gender bent one, which I loved! My questions are these: in this version, Amy said that she wanted to marry Paul as soon as she learned he was Jewish so that she could have her very own Jew. I really don’t remember that from the nyc version? That seems like something that wouldn’t fly there (or maybe I’m being overly sensitive) so I was wondering if it was something from the original that had been taken out in more recent renditions. My second question is that there was a scene in which Peter tries to kiss Bobby and Bobby rejects him. I definitely don’t remember anything like that happening in the genderbent version. Is that something that slipped my mind too? Or was it taken out? 
As a last comment, it was interesting that in this production the guy who played Bobby was 10 years older than the woman who played Joanne. So near the end when she’s giving him advice, they made it more into a “them laughing at the rest of the youngens in the world” thing which I thought was a cool choice. 
Anyway, looking forward to hearing your guy’s thoughts!

It introduced millions of Americans to the Holocaust and its victims. But what did reenacting Anne’s story mean to the people who created and acted in the play or the 1959 film? How did dramatizing her life affect their lives and careers? Who were they?

Using archival material and interviews with surviving cast and crew members, *Forward* executive editor Adam Langer presents a story that’s never been told: the backstory of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play and Oscar-winning film, and how this iconic work shapes those involved in performing it — including high school students putting the show on today.

611,Why does it seem like Belle such a difficult role to cast?,10k0sax,"Looking/listening back at the OMPS, Paige O'Hara was perfection, the OBC Susan Egan has a different take on the character, but can still hit all the notes, same for the OLC recording - Julie-Alanah Brighten had her own take on it, but again hit all the notes. I am too young to remember much from when I saw it, and assuming we didn't have the understudy/alternative my, dad would defiantly have moaned if the singing was bad, he definatly did after other shows. When I listen to foreign language cast recordings again, the music is spot on. 

Coming forward to present day, as awful as the quality is of the bootleg, (Bristol Hippodrome bootleg) Courtney Stapleton can clearly hit all the notes the part requires and if I had been in the UK I would have tried to see the tour. 

Emma Watson was awful, I am not saying she cannot sing, but she can't sing the Belle track, its not in her range. The new songs written for her vocal range were great. She is an actress before a singer so really they should have gone with someone else, or got someone else to sing. The worst crime is for the foreign language dubbing, they sometimes auto tuned the actresses who have tread the boards, sometimes as belle.

 I mean Julia Milena Scheeser (German) does not need auto tune, same for Emmylou Homs (French) Tinne Oltmans (dutch) all can sing perfectly well and yet in some places where Emma Watson has major autotune, they fake autotune the dubbers. If you watch any of the dubbers in concert singing the same song, they hit every note. for the ones that are clearly properly recorded you can really hear it in videos such as this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INiOkW7qpFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INiOkW7qpFI) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5BuK6DXQVY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5BuK6DXQVY) \- not all are stage actresses but they either are stage or really good singers who do great musical dubbing. Emma is great at acting but there was no acting in the audio whilst she was truly singing.

With the 30th anniversary they went another direction, they found a singer, and she can usually hit most of the notes, but as soon as you are thinking she has got it, it sounds like she has a temporary cold ... she also has far too much forced vibrato which just ruins it. 

The main issue in going for a singer, and its not just H.E.R. I have the same issue with Shania Twain, is they almost try too hard with the singing and forget the reason the characters break out into song during a musical (ignoring sung through musicals such as les mis). If its too emotional to say, sing it.

In a musical the singing is to show a deeper truth, either instead of speaking people singing in harmony, time may stop as you hear an inner dialogue or we get a call back to a prior theme or train of through through echoes in the music. Even if the singer is pitch perfect, if they swell their singing at bits that sound strong in the music, it might not be the bit that is emotionally strong, or if they just belt the whole song there is no nuance at the moments there should be. , at the bit that sounds musically rbut with the words, its not the moment to stress etc  

To skip away from Belle for a moment, you can 100% hear that Josh Groban and Joshua Henry are pitch perfect. Groban in evermore and the emotion and story of the song is there throughout, its obvious he is a musical performer. Same goes for Henry in Mob Song and the other bit of songs when he sings. I missed how good he was initially as Le Fou was awful and distracted me during the earlier songs.",eish2306,1,0,0.44
612,Saw five shows this weekend! Here are my reviews.,10jxjgc,"Once a year, I like to take the bus up from DC and see a few shows in NYC. This long weekend, I saw five total.  Caveat - I am a peon who did some random high school theater and have zero training. I just like musicals and pretty things, so if any of my opinions make you clutch your theatrical pearls, just remember I’m a normal person who journeys to the big city once a year. 

Friday - Moulin Rouge. I had seen this once before in the pre-COVID days, but I didn’t appreciate Aaron Tveit enough back then. When I heard he was coming back, (and once I saw the Roxanne opt-up on tik tok), I knew I wanted to go again. Plus, Moulin Rouge is one of my top five movies of all time - to the point I had Satine’s red “smoldering temptress” dress made for my senior prom. I had seats in the very last row, but being that far back meant I had a great appreciation for the spectacle of it all. I love the ambiance pre-show, and I think this is the most stunning set I’ve ever seen. 

Aaron as Christian was incredible (although the women screaming for him were a little funny at times).  Ashley as Satine - her voice was so lovely and clear, but there were times it had an odd twang like a country music star. (She felt almost Carrie Underwood-ish in certain moments.)

While the OG Moulin rouge is mostly a jukebox musical, some of the extra songs in the play were a little cheesy. There were some chuckles during quite serious moments when people realized what song was starting. But it’s all worth it to hear Roxanne. While he didn’t opt up in my performance, I had goosebumps the entire time. 

Overall - such a fun show.  I recommend everyone see. 

Saturday night - Six.  I had listened to the soundtrack for this so many times that it felt a little weird to be seeing it live.  While the girls were all insanely talented and I had a good time, coming down from the set design and choreography of Moulin Rouge to more of a pop concert vibe was a bit of a letdown. And it’s so short!

Overall - fun but more of a pop concert vibe than full Broadway spectacular. 

Sunday matinee - Funny Girl. Glee was big when I was in college and I wore out the first season soundtrack listening to Lea sing “Don’t rain on my parade”. I followed all the drama about beanie and Lea, and I knew I wanted to see her in this part. 

Lea killed every song. I had chills the entire time.  And I thought she was okay with some of the humor scenes, although the characters acting like she is some ugly girl with a funny personality was a little unbelievable since Lea is so dang pretty.  And her jump from super New York accent to singing like an angel was a little jarring. 

(It was also interesting to see Amber Ardilino since I folllowed her tik tok drama as well. She was fine in the chorus but didn’t stand out.)

I feel like I was a part of something kinda iconic, although I loved the old couple next to me who had no clue who she was. 

Overall - must must see. 

Sunday PM - Little shop of horrors. I love this theater. It’s so small and cozy. Every seat feels like a good seat. Lena and Matt were both great but honestly the dentist had me in tears laughing.His performance was so exaggerated that it could have gone an awful direction, but it ended up being so freaking funny. And the puppetry with Audrey Two was delightful.  I’m so curious how Maude Apatow is going to do in this next month. 

Overall - iconic musical in an intimate theater. If you deeply appreciate the humor during every replaying of “Agony” from Into the Woods, then I think you too will cry laugh. 

Monday PM - Sleep No More. I’ve loved this every time I’ve seen it, and tonight was no exception. Every actor was so good, and I love discovering new details each run through. I do think though there are too many people let in, and tonight especially, it felt like a lot of first timers who didn’t understand the concept of show. The amount of times someone meandered after a running actor and would get angry if we tried to push past them was frustrating. Or groups holding hands and blocking areas while talking. I even saw people on their phones during scenes. I wish there was an option to pay a little more money for a more immersive experience without the dozens of slow walkers. 

Overall - don’t take your parents, But do take yourself.

637,Cervantes/Quitoxe played by female lead,10izk8h,"My wife and I have tickets to see *Man of La Mancha* next month, put on by a local semi-professional theater group, and I just found out that the lead is to played by a female. I am intrigued by the role reversal and yet at the same time wondering how they’ll pull this off. 

The story, based on Cervantes classic tale *Don Quixote*, wherein he wrote himself as a poet/performer thrown in prison by the Inquisition, and he uses his art to persuade the other prisoners not to violate him.  He involves them in his tale and they come to respect him before he is brought before the Inquisitor. I cannot envision a woman in the role, only because of the time period of the show. 

It’s quite possible this Cervantes will still be male, I don’t know, they aren’t saying (and others have asked). My wife is concerned, as she’s never seen it and is worried this may ruin it for her. No idea. 

Thoughts? It’s such a wonderful show, this troupe is really good, I’m confident it’ll be great. Has anyone heard of a role reversal for this show?

Edit: I will post after the show, to explain how they did it.

Edit: suffice to say, they crushed it, the entire ensemble was fantastic. I had tears in my eyes several times, including “Impossible Dream.” Was a wonderful experience, we had a great time (front row seats didn’t hurt, either).",kberson,10,0,0.5

I'd heard from friends and family who've see it that it's kind of tired and the cast may or may not be as into it as they'd be in a different show. We left the theater talking about how much we loved it, which I didn't expect. 

Last night the energy was absolutely electric, and I think I'm correct in assuming it was because of Jinkx. When she first came out the cheers went on for longer than I've ever experienced, and she more than deserved it, she was phenomenal. We were talking to someone who said they flew in from Georgia for the show, and they definitely weren't the only one who traveled for Jinkx. 

My friend and I were talking about if any other stunt casting had fans this rabid and a reaction like Jinkx has. We went through the list of celebs who've been in the show and don't think any one would be treated like Jinkx was/is, but I'd love to hear anecdotes.",ilysespieces,6,10,0.92

7,White Girl In Danger is what Musical Theater needs right now,11w5tsf,"Saw it and was blown away by the imagination and craft, in a world of continuous commercial construction with the broadest sensibility possible and literalism of lyricism, Michael R Jackson created a musical that actually sounds like the musical genre it borrows from with brilliant orchestrations by Lynne Shankel. A composer and orchestrator who knows what a synth from the 80’s is meant to be used for and what kind of mood it evokes instead of that useless Les Miz electric piano and Yamaha keyboard preset string patch. Certainly a lumbering large beast that will be distilled (currently in previews) but as it stands it confronts a tendency of the past years of political profiteering that haunts theater artists and instagram infographic creators psyche to continue to appease everyone, to problematize everything and yet create no hope in its place: certainly some people will dislike it, for its delving into the seemingly surface level genre of soap opera before exploding it as an exploration in all directions of the white/black art divide in both its existence and non-existence. 

People complain Broadway shows aren’t fun anymore: This is if you let yourself have fun.

People complain Broadway shows don’t explore contemporary relevant themes: This does by unavoidably meeting you with the information and context of a singular human view.

People complain Broadway shows aren’t original: This one most definitely is.

Absurdism may not be your cup of tea in the same way people over 40 at times can’t enjoy certain forms of meme humor in the face of a world actively flattening everything into broad appealing corporate sentimentalism on unexamined multiculturalism. This show rides the razor, and for some may fall past, and even i felt pushed into meaninglessness for a brief moment but all in service of both entertainment and rigor with something to say: that being “Make. With all your heart please make. Be aware and awake and you will hurt others, you will hurt yourself, but try to make for others that they may make for others. Write what you know? You will never know enough unless you try to make.”

A wonderfully constructed fantasia on soap operas that peels back to portrait one writers attempts to give and inspire, even in an art form many may dismiss. Soap Opera or musical theater.

The music was clever, original, and rocked. The cast had amazing range and could dance. They did a fantastic job of combining humor with the historical perspective while engaging the audience.

I went into it knowing nothing about the show, and came out feeling like I had gone to a concert. I see a lot of standing ovations primarily in the orchestra section, but today, every single person in the theater was on their feet cheering by the end of the show.

9,Hamilton Angelica Tour Review,11w4you,"Hello, first review. Today I saw the Hamilton Angelica tour cast's penultimate performance in Tulsa, Oklahoma at the Sunday matinee, and it was so good that I had to write it down.  If you've wondered about seeing this tour, the TLDR is YES.   Detailed cast breakdown below! 

CAST
I love seeing alternates and standbys -- only happened for 1 major role today, Deejay Young as Laurens/Philip, but he was OUTSTANDING. I'm so glad I got to see him. His performance was so emotional and intense, his voice was beautiful and strong. I don't usually care about Laurens and kind of hate Philip, but I watched him *every minute* he was on stage. Deejay vibrated with intensity and the joy of performance . ""Tomorrow There'll Be More Of Us""? Excuse me while I weep. Truly a standout; I hope I see him in the future. 

The entire Angelica tour cast is phenomenal. Edred Utome was great as Hamilton, full of crackling energy and brash youth in the beginning (""Farmer Refuted"" crackled and sparked) and a weariness near the end that was very moving and real.  Josh Tower made me cry 3 times as Burr -- ""Wait for It"", ""Dear Theodosia"", and ""The World Was Wide Enough"".  Beautiful singing, lovely speaking voice, compelling acting. He pulled so much emotion into his vocal delivery, SO GOOD.  Edred's and Josh's voices blended beautifully in ""Dear Theodosia"", that was truly lovely. Each was fantastic in their own role and played very well against each other, and both were very well suited to both the singing and rapping. Great job by both! 

Alyssa Deslorieux was emotional and compelling as Eliza, and that's a role I struggle to enjoy.  ""Burn"" was *so good* and it, along with ""Who Lives Who Dies Who Tells Your Story"", hit me in ways they usually do not. Mom and I were holding hands and crying at the end, thinking about dad, whom we lost last October.  Alyssa really pulled me in.  She hits her vocals harder than I'm used to for Eliza, but it worked and I think that helped me like the character.  Stephanie Umoh was intense and controlled as Angelica, and ""Satisfied"" was every bit as excellent as I hoped.   Yana Perrault brought fantastic Peggy energy, which the audience loved, and sang the hell out of Maria. She wore a long wig for Peggy and rocked a buzzcut as Maria, which I haven't seen done before, and loved with Maria's stunning red dress (second best costume).

Peter Matthew Smith was a huge hit as King George; his take was very fun, and the audience (and my mom!) loved him.  David Park was fantastic as Lafayette and his Jefferson was great (mom especially loved Jefferson). So charismatic in both roles, nailed the fast rapping, and *wow* did he look smashing in Jefferson's burgundy coat.  Best costume piece by far.  Tyler Belo was exploding with charisma as Hercules -- his part in ""Battle of Yorktown"" was stellar -- and solid but funny as Madison. 

But the star performance, for me and mom and the entire audience, was Carvens Lissaint as Washington. He was OUTSTANDING.  He came in with this intense coiled energy -- quiet but a visible fire within.  And when he sang... I can't even cope with how good he was.  His singing got 2 bursts of spontaneous applause in places I've never seen in the first act alone. He was SO GOOD. I thought the place was going to explode after One Last Time.  I felt his final vocals in my soul.  (Why can't touring casts have CDs?)

The ensemble (11 people) was great.  They do so much in this show! I was in row K, so I got to see faces for a change, and it was a joy to watch the ensemble members.   

Interesting diversity note: John Laurens/Philip was unusually short, Eliza was short next to Angelica, and Peggy/Maria was unusually tall. I wish I had pictures, because the Schuyler sisters were so striking! Peggy towered over Angelica, who was quite a bit taller than Eliza. So much love for this. Not everyone is average height! And Asian representation for Lafayette/Jefferson! So much love for this cast. 

STAGING
The staging was so well done. I love the way Hamilton integrates moving scenery and props; it reminds me of the NY Opera staging of A Little Night Music that aired on PBS, but with more energy. Love a good revolve, and this show uses it so well and so creatively.

WORTH IT? 
If you haven't seen it live and wonder if it's worth it, yes.  I've devoured the pro shot and went in expecting certain spots to be draggy or unengaging. So wrong.  This cast is so good. Even ""Quiet Uptown"" held me, and that is down to Edred Utomi's and Alysha Deslorieux's acting and chemistry.  There is an electricity to a good live performance that can reach further into your soul than something you see on-screen.  And this show goes so fast.  They don't milk the applause, they let it hit, and then the show rolls on. It didn't feel like a 3 hour show.  

But buy your tickets from the *primary website for the venue* or their recommended vendor, not secondary markets. We got seats on row K for $159 each and it was well worth it.  

AUDIENCE
And lastly, with all you hear about bad audiences these days, I've got to shout out the Tulsa audience. Looked nearly full (2,365 seats), tons of kids, not one problem.   The quiet moments in the show *hit* because the audience was so respectful and engaged. Silent at the right points, and I mean DEAD SILENT, shouting and applauding at the right points (and at 2 breakthrough points for Carvens Lissaint as Washington!).  Great energy, great experience at the Tulsa PAC. The ushers were super nice and very helpful. Highly recommend this tour cast and venue.

11,Hercules 3.19 Closing Day Review,11w3dtl,"Hey all, saw the closing day matinee of Hercules today at the Paper Mill playhouse. I eagerly read many of your reviews earlier in the run so wanted to follow up with a review of sorts from the final day of the run. 

Overall as expected, the show needs work. Act one was bloated, while Act 2 felt rushed. The climactic battle with the titans was…anti climactic. It’s like they just ran out of steam on the staging and gave up. Some interesting changes made to the telling of the story but overall I think they stuck too closely to the film. 

Bradley Gibson and Isabelle McCalla sang beautifully. Not much chemistry but separately I enjoyed them. Gibson brought the boyish naïveté to Hercules but disappeared a bit in ensemble numbers. 

Shuler Hensley performed the material given to him well but I thought Hades was just problematic overall. He wasn’t menacing and didn’t feel like a real threat. I think if this show ever were to ‘go the distance’ they’d be better off with a true comedian in the role. The new song given to hades was lackluster compared to the songs from the film so who cares if the actor doesn’t really sing as long as he sells it. The film performance was iconic…on stage they could use more of a fast talker landing actually funny one liners.Try out a Bill Hader type as Hades or something. 

Pros
- Unsurprisingly, the muses stole the show. They were wonderful. High energy, electric vocals and presence. Lit up the stage every time. Would totally watch a series of shorts on Disney Plus with the muses providing their hot takes on Disney movies. 
- James Monroe Iglehart is just pure charisma and made the most of a pretty flat role. The man literally did a cartwheel. 
- Some of the book gave more detail to Hercules’ family and time on earth and was genuinely heartwarming 
- I liked the puppets and thought they showed a lot of promise if given a bigger budget for a future staging 
- cool staging effects such as the River Styx in the closing, the mortal thread turning golden, etc
- Pain and Panic were the perfect sidekicks. Genuinely Funny, GREAT chemistry 


Cons:
- Pacing
- Drowning in exposition. The first act is so so heavy on the early exposition. It’s largely communicated through song and while I knew the story if you were trying to follow lyrics it would be tough. This is where I think they stayed too close to the film. Most of the early scenes with Zeus, Hera and the gods could have been condensed or even scrapped. 
- Some of the costumes were…low effort. When James Monroe iglehart didn’t appear in their press photos I thought maybe he had a cool Phil costume they wanted to be a surprise or something. It was…a tracksuit. 
- Choreography? There were dance break moments that were just randomly inserted into songs and unearned. A lot of large ensemble numbers seemed chaotic. 
- Zeus was kind of a dick? Frigid with no encouragement or hope for Hercules re: returning to Olympus? Hera was warm and nurturing but Zeus was a weird take. 
- The book in general. Jokes weren’t great, it was too scattered and bloated. Way too much time spent setting up the actual story.

But visualize playbill photos of each of the following shows, as reviewed below. Also, the Wicked Shirt .... I guess you'll have to go to Shubert Alley and see it! But it's not that exciting, haha)

&#x200B;

Just got back from three and a half days in my favourite city in the whole entire world. Every time I go, I have to remind myself how lucky I am go get to go to the city (once a year, if I am really lucky, twice) and see shows. I saw three really amazing ones this time around and wanted to leave my reviews!

&#x200B;

Sweeney - Josh Groban was out that night, so I had a pity moment of ""awwww"", but his understudy, Nicholas Christopher, was also SOOOOOO good. Honestly, though, Annaleigh Ashford steals the show. She is going to be nominated for a Tony, for sure. I have always found her HILARIOUS and she was such a force on the stage. She got lots of laughs (I have never seen a production of Sweeney, just the movie, and was surprised at how much laughter there was from the audience). I was also really surprised by Gaten Matarazzo - I don't watch Stranger Things, so I don't know him well, but I really liked him as Toby. He did the character really well. I liked the whole thing - the second act is so suspenseful, and like I knew how it ended but I was also quite literally on the edge of my seat, waiting for what I knew was coming. SO good.

Parade - this was my favourite show of the three. I have loved the music to this show since 2015 when I saw the concert version at Lincoln Center (with Jeremy Jordan and Laura Benanti). I was really looking forward to this, and ya know, it is probably the top five theatre performances I have ever seen. It was the night after opening night, and the entire cast was ON POINT. I have always wanted to see Ben Platt live, and good god, did he ever do a good job. Hearing him since ""This is Not Over Yet"" was one of my favourite moments of the night. Micaela Diamond also really, really impressed me. I am not a HUGE crier (although I am much more of a crier now than when I was younger), and I welled up in the last twenty minutes. You know that emoji that's like :O .... literally my face the last twenty to thirty moments. Idk, people sometimes talk about their ""sex face"" but on this trip to Broadway I realized I had a ""watching amazing theatre face"". Both for Sweeney and Parade it was just my mouth agape and not really moving, just SO engrossed. I must look so dumb, but everyone is looking at the stage and not at me, haha. ANYWAY! This show is worth seeing. If ANYONE is on the fence or only has time for one show, dear god, let it be this one. It's SO, SO good.

Kimberly Akimbo - I went into this show blind, just knowing the overall story, but not much else. It was so cute! I don't think it is a show I would see again, but seeing it with the original cast was so special. Victoria Clark and Justin Cooley were my particular favourites. I kind of thought >!the subplot about robbing a bank was kind of dumb, and I wasn't sure if we were supposed to like/root for Aunt Deb or accept her as a terrible person!< but it's ok, I was more paying attention to the storyline of Kim and her parents. Also, from the whole show, I am only finding about 3-4 of the songs worth listening to again. But the opening number ""Skater Planet,"" I have listened to about 20 times since this morning, on my flight home. It is my new favourite song and what I consider to be an excellent opening number. I also liked the finale song a lot, and the reprise of ""Skater Planet"", and I don't mind ""This time"". Again, I wouldn't see it again, but I am glad I did.

The last photo is just a shirt I found at the Shubert Alley store, that according to the cashier is an exclusive to that store. Having not purchased any Wicked merch since 2009 (which is fine, because pre- 2009 I had spent a small fortune on Wicked merch), I simply couldn't help myself. New favourite shirt.

&#x200B;

SO! Overall!! My rankings for shows this week, in my own opinion, are

1. Parade
2. Sweeney
3. Kimblerly Akimbo.

But they were all great. Just a great week on Broadway. I love Broadway. I love it from the tips of my fingers and all the way down to the soles of my feet.

14,Moulin Rouge and Sweeney Todd Reviews (a very chaotic 48 hours in NYC),11w285p,"Prefacing this by saying that this is going to be a very long post because my overall trip experience in NYC definitely impacted how I received these 2 shows, so here’s a storytime that nobody asked for. 

I made an extremely quick trip to NYC this weekend, arriving on Friday afternoon and leaving early this morning (Sunday). We had tickets to see Sweeney Todd on Friday and Moulin Rouge on Saturday night—this was my first time coming to NYC in 5 years and I was dying to see Josh Groban and Aaron Tveit. 

I am an unapologetic Josh Groban stan. If you’ve been following Sweeney Todd’s social media, you’ll also probably know that this was a very emotionally turbulent weekend for Josh Groban stans going to see Sweeney Todd. Thursday afternoon as I was packing my bags, they announced that he had a sinus infection and would be out of the show that night, so we flew to NYC without knowing if we would actually get to see Josh even though he had been our main reason for going. I went ahead and started looking into the refund policy just in case that was a route we decided to go if he was out of the show since they were the single most expensive theatre tickets I’ve ever bought. (I actually made a post in this sub a few days ago asking about that so if you were one of the people who responded then thank you so much, you really helped my decision making!)

By the time we got to our hotel in NYC on Friday, they announced that Josh would be out for that night’s show and the Saturday matinee. We made the choice to try to swap our shows and see MR on Friday and Sweeney on Saturday night just in case Josh happened to be back in the show by then because we knew we were gonna be really disappointed if he was there and we missed it due to being at another show. Miraculously, I was able to find new seats that were even cheaper than our original ones and was able to request a refund for those since he was out of the show. We ended up with second row center mezz seats for MR and rear orchestra for Sweeney and Josh came back to the show just in time for us to catch him!!

And now that I’ve rambled about the emotional rollercoaster I went on, here’s what I thought of the shows. 

Moulin Rouge!— 

the show: Aaron Tveit, oh my god. I knew he was gonna be good but it was so much better than I’d even imagined, my jaw was on the floor basically from Chandelier all the way until the end of the show. He did the glorious opt-up at the end of Roxanne and I think I might have cried a little. The energy in the room was great but luckily our audience was pretty much only rowdy at the appropriate moments, I was expecting more issues with people wanting to sing along or cheering way too loud way too often. And the sets! The dancing! Everyone was amazing, I’ve seen mixed reviews on here about Ashley Loren but I loved her. My critiques of the show were pretty much only the things I was already aware of going into it like the book and this ended up being a great show to see while I was tired after flying because it asks you to use precisely 0 brain cells. 

the seats: (front mezzanine center row B) I ended up paying so much money for these front mezz seats but I couldn’t have asked for a better spot for my (probably) one and only Tveit experience. We were just far back enough to have a nice wide view of everything but could also see people’s facial expressions super well. I had to lean forward just a little bit if I wanted to see people’s feet on the catwalk but that wasn’t really important 99% of the time. Zidler shot a bunch of confetti on us toward the beginning of the show. 

Overall, MR was just as wonderful as I’d hoped for, if not even better. It really is so so impressive to watch in person. 

Sweeney Todd— 

the show: putting my love for Josh Groban aside, I also just adore this show and could not have been more excited going into it. this is probably a very bad review if I can’t think of one bad thing to say about the show, but I really can’t. I loved the sets, I loved the choreography that some people on here don’t like, I LOVED the performances. Annaleigh Ashford sang Mrs Lovett so beautifully while also giving one of the funniest performances I’ve ever seen onstage. I definitely see her getting a Tony nom for this. Gaten Matarazzo made an awesome Toby imo and it was incredible getting to see him as a stranger things fan, I was grinning like an idiot all throughout Pirelli’s Miracle Elixir. Speaking of Pirelli, Nicholas Christopher is AMAZING in that role, so I’m sure he also knocked it out of the park as Sweeney. Jordan Fisher’s voice was lower than you would usually hear for Anthony but I feel like he made it work well and sounded beautiful with Maria Bilbao as Johanna. She was so so stunning. Jeanna de Waal was on for the beggar woman and was also flawless! As for Josh, I’ll just say that I’m never gonna recover from that Epiphany. That change in lighting when he came down the stairs had me losing my mind. 

the seats: we were in rear orchestra right row YY, which is the second to back row in that section. they’re definitely not the best seats in the house as a couple of things that happen very high up toward the proscenium were obstructed, but that didn’t happen frequently at all. these were about $145 per ticket which is way more reasonable than most Sweeney seats have been, so I would absolutely sit there again for the price. 

congrats if you actually read through all of this and if you have any more questions about these 2 shows or what the process of trying to swap the order of our shows was like lmk!",falling-15,12,37,0.97

16,Bad Cinderella review from someone who was super eager to see it (and happy!),11w0t8b,"&#x200B;

(Disclaimer: I almost always have a great time at the theater and enjoy what I’m watching, even if I don’t end up loving the show in the long-term. I get grumpy with critics who seem to hate everything light-hearted; christ, not everything needs to be Chekov. I defend underdog shows like a protective mother. There, that’s me.)

Just saw Bad Cinderella this afternoon, and here’s my take: okay, I was RABID to see this, and not to hate-watch it either! I heard the London Original Cast Recording and the concept hit me beautifully. The lyrics are cutting and terrific (The lyricist of City Of Angels—omigod, how could you go wrong!) and the music is catchy, especially the “It Has To Be Her” theme. So I really wanted to see it before the critics get it and savage it, which is what I fear given the love-hate on Lloyd-Webber and the irresistible folly of calling it “Bad Cinderella” (c’mon, that alone is just inviting vicious reviews, you know it).

Short take: it was SO much fun. Some musical and concept changes from the London version, expectedly, but nothing that I found egregious, and some that feels more accessible. (Unbreakable is replaced by a song called Easy To Be Me; I guess we’ll all decide which we liked better.) And the performances are so, so good. Genao is very solid in the lead and the supporting cast is IMHO even more delightful, with theater vets Carmello and McLean doing astonishingly funny work as the Stepmother and the Queen. And Dobson as Prince Sebastian is so adorably charismatic and perfect in this role, and completely stole my heart every time he was onstage, I just loved him. I’m so glad I saw this cast in particular. Acosta Robinson is utterly compelling as the Godmother for all her short appearance.

I would love even more diversity in the ensemble, besides Genao and Dobson; my performance had 3 actors of color in the female chorus—though perhaps there were others in the chorus who were Latinx etc. that I did not identify. And yes, I absolutely loved the LGBT representation of the storyline.

The audience was great, they were really happy to be there and enjoying it, and multiple numbers got cheers and applause before the number was even complete (Dobson’s lovely sustained note at the end of Only You, Lonely You was a serious treat).

Is it candy, is it bubblegum as a previous reviewer says? Sure, why not call it that, but I love candy. I want candy every day, don’t I? Especially candy that leaves me wanting to learn half the songs! If you’re keen on a happy catchy musical I think this is a delight.",amantiana,13,16,0.72

I’m currently stuck between Lion King and Wicked as the fox to get. I’ve seen Wicked once (over 10+ years ago so I’d love to see it again) and I’ve never seen Lion King but have heard great things.

26,Advice for shows in late May?,11vprgp,"My boyfriend and I will be visiting New York in late May (arrive May 30, leave June 2) and my priority is seeing some great theater. By my reckoning, we have four shows we can see: Tues night, Wed matinee, Wed night, and Thurs night.

We already have tickets for Sweeney Todd (Wed night) and Camelot (Th night). We love Sweeney, so that was a must, and neither of us have seen a staging of Camelot and we both love the music. But I'd love your advice on our last two options.

We're from Los Angeles, so lots of stuff tours here. I'd call us pretty adventurous in our theatergoing. We're less interested in the bigger long-lasting shows because we've been lucky enough to see many of them (Wicked, Moulin Rouge, Book of Mormon, Hadestown, Hamilton, etc etc). I think we'd like to see at least one straight play, but honestly we're open. I'm leaning away from revivals generally because we're already seeing two revivals...

Here are some things I'm interested in:

* Fat Ham
* Kimberly Akimbo
* Leopoldstadt (we're almost 100% sold on this one?)
* Grey House (technically its opening night is Tuesday, so we could catch the Wednesday matinee)
* A Doll's House
* Life of Pi
* Some Like It Hot (it sounds great; my hesitation is that this one almost certainly will tour...)

Other shows I considered but am less interested in:

* Shucked sounds a little....light to me. 
* I was kind of hoping White Girl in Danger might extend its run, but that sounds unlikely given the early buzz (and perhaps for the best). 
* I like Parade, but I have seen a terrific production of it before, so I prioritized Camelot this time. 
* Funny Girl really doesn't interest me all that much unless Lea Michele really, truly is unmissable, so I feel more lukewarm there.
* I thought about Little Shop, but again, I've seen it many times before, so my interest would be more production/cast-specific. And again, I don't want to spend four days in New York watching nothing but revivals.

Sweeney Todd is most appealing to me but I have only seen the movie.

32,I Saw Shucked!,11ve5jo,"I got Shucked tonight! I bought tickets before previews started with the TodayTix deal. I initially was just curious and I love seeing new musicals, and I got so excited when the extreme rave reviews were coming in.

Well, its fine. It's got a great cast (love seeing broadway debuts!), and I personally loved the music even though like many have said it's very forgettable. I read someone's review of it earlier and they called the humor borscht belt-style one liners, and that's exactly it. Almost every joke got a chuckle out of me, but all the humor is pretty much one liners (with Grey's storyteller and Peanut's dialogue almost entirely made up of these). One that my mom couldn't seem to stop dying over was at one point Grey's storyteller says ""You know what they say, a paper airplane that doesn't fly is just stationary"". They're all in the same vain as that.  I saw others call it Book of Mormon level funny - um no not at all lol.

I was excited to see the book was written by the same person that did the Tootsie book (I know that show it hit or miss but I personally loved it), and it just didn't meet my expectations with that either. The story is very basic, and both my mom and I agreed that the rising action and main conflict plot points revolving around corn and rocks and a marriage that was very hasty and clearly shouldn't happen didn't absorb me into the story. I wasn't ever rooting for a character to win or for a couple to end up together because the pacing felt so hasty and the development was shallow. Also beginning the show by revealing what was gonna end up happening at the end didn't help either. The audience knowing more than the characters made the show super low stakes. I honestly think the storyteller characters were my favorite characters in the show, but the plot is so basic that I don't feel like storyteller characters need to be there to explain along the way.

The standing o for LuLu's song was well deserved, give her more!! And the ensemble members pretty much only have parts in the second half of Act 2, give them more too! I noticed that I loved Act 2 as soon as the Yee-Haw song with all the barrel rolling choreography was over, and the scene of all the guys at the bar getting drunk before the wedding was perfect.

I didn't struggle trying to figure out where they were, but the minimal set didn't add to the show at all, especially because the color palette is mostly greens and browns. I was trying to think of a similar show in this respect and I could only think of Come From Away, but I think they did it in a really great and inventive way. Here it felt like they were just missing set pieces or they could really use some more. Everything in the set is slanted in a way that I interpreted to make the scenery more whimsical, but I think it would benefit if the whole stage was framed with a literal bookend or book binding to make it look like its in a story, rather than someone built everything with a lazy eye.

I don't mean to be harsh at all, but I'm really struggling to relate to these rave reviews that popped up immediately. Someone I think posted wondering if they were plants and I mean I don't want to say it, but I think some of them may be.

Bottom line, it's cute but forgettable and also really, really, really corny (get it). I think its up to you and your taste to decide if thats a good or bad thing. Regardless, if you can get a cheap ticket I would say go see it simply because theres hardly anything truly new on Broadway recently and I would love to see something like this succeed in the long run. Also, it's still got at least 2 weeks of previews to go! I can absolutely see this show getting tightened up and edited more",ConfisKate,2,4,0.61
33,"Thoughts on Some Like it Hot, Dancin’, Shucked, and Sweeney Todd",11v9kq5,"Hey! I just saw these four shows and wanted to share my experience/reviews for those deciding. (If you’re not a fan of reviews scroll past plz)

Some Like it Hot: Way better than expected. Great dancing, choreo and ensemble work. Each individual in the cast is very talented. I saw the swing for Sugar instead of Adrianna Hicks but she was lovely and very talented. Christian Borle (the reason I came to see it) was mostly great but didn’t really try to change his voice when he was playing Josephine (maybe not to damage his voice?). J. Harrison Ghee stole the show and is one of the most talented individuals I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. Ghee had such a powerful performance that brought me to tears with both comedic and dramatic excellence. Natasha Yvette Williams was beyond hilarious. The show overall handles themes of race and gender with respect and deviates from the movie greatly to add insightful commentary. 

Dancin’- (context: I was a dancer for 12 years and my sister dances over 40 hours a week) I was not very impressed with the show. Of course I don’t blame the dancers as I can tell they are talented but more direction was needed to ensure timing and consistency. Also leg extensions, tilts, arabesques we’re not very impressive from some cast members. Peter John Chursin was one of the few dancers I found to be exceptional. 

Shucked- It was cute! It was pretty much what I expected it, Grey Henson is always fun to watch. Great singers and ensemble work. Fun choreography and use of props during one of the later numbers. You’re not missing too much if you don’t see it but it’s a fun watch with a talented cast.

Sweeney Todd- Insanely good cast, unsurprisingly. Josh Groban’s voice filled the theatre wonderfully. I was initially worried about his acting from what I had read but for the most part I was pleasantly surprised. Annaleigh Ashford was hilarious. I’m a huge Sweeney Todd fan but never found it that funny, yet she made the show so much funnier. She has great physicality and acting choices. Jordan Fisher has the most beautiful voice for Johanna and had a great accent for the role. Maria Bilbao has one of the most technically pristine voices I have ever heard. Her mixed voice and transition between registers was beyond lovely. She sounded great with Jordan Fisher. Gaten Matarazzo was great and “Not While I’m Around” was probably my favorite song of the night. Great acting and vocal quality, he’s just enjoyable to watch. Gaten and Jordan were so sweet and kind at stagedoor.",InnerTone5925,0,32,0.89
34,a review of the shows I saw on Broadway including Sweeney Todd and Shucked,11v99is,"Long time Broadway lover and lurker of this page. Fourth time in NYC and I've seen west end shows too along with Toronto's Mirvish productions so I have exposure to lots of different types of show s  Was in NYC for a few days and saw some shows - here's my review.

Life of Pi: watched the movie when it came out, excited about seeing puppets. We got tickets from TCKTs which were a box with slightly limited view but we saw everything up close which was super cool. Genuinely the most stunning play I've seen, the puppets were incredible and I swear that tiger looked me right in the eye. I would highly recommend seeing this play, well worth the money and an incredibly fun and heart warming experience. 

A Doll's House. Rushed this on TodayTix and had great seats on the balcony. Never seen this before, don't know any other Ibsen. Have seen Jaime Lloyd's Seagull which was good (I think). Obviously the acting is amazing with Jessica Chastain and the story is well told. I enjoyed this more than the Seagull and felt the directing choices made sense more. Lloyd loves minimalism and for this I do think it worked however if you're not into his style you probably won't enjoy this. Also you need to be house right to see the ending. 

Sweeney Todd. Love Sondheim, though this isn't my favorite musical and I've only seen an amateur production before. Booked seats in advance. 26 piece orchestra is phenomenal, lighting and set design is immersive and stunning. The chorus is incredibly talent. Grobans voice is magnificent and I'd say he brings a warmth and gentleness to the Fleet street killer. Ashford I think was the standout performer with great comedic timing and her and Groban's on stage dynamic carried the story. Fisher I struggled to hear over the orchestra but maybe it's where we sat and I think he has the weakest performance of all the stars. Matarazzo was a solid Toby and clearly is at home on stage. Some people have mixed people in choreography but I loved it and thought it was well done. My partner found the accents questionable at times but she is authentically British. Overall, its a great production with solid leads, clearly a massive budget and provides that Broadway experience that one would expect.

Shucked: didn't know anything about this musical except it's about corn and TikTok said it was good. Rushed it the AM and the line was long af. It was enjoyable and I've never laughed that hard in a show in ages. The music is forgettable though digestable minus a few songs and the plot combines classic Broadway tropes while still giving a fresh feel. The cast is solid with one song that gets a standing ovation half way through. Ultimately enjoyable Broadway entertainment and it fills the theater. My biggest complaint is that it falls into romantic tropes where infidelity is glorified while trying to also be progressive in ways so it feels mildly floundering in it's morals. Still glad I saw it and I think it's important to try new works. 

Bottom Line
Our of all the above, life of pi is a must see 
Sweeney Todd delivered and is also a great revival
A Dolls House is great if you're a fan of new imaginings of plays 
Shucked is something you should see if you're trying to find another thing to see and you want something light hearted and fun

53,Yet another Camelot review,11uoivr,"I went to see Camelot on Wednesday night, and I've been enjoying people's reviews so much that I thought I'd write my own. Overall, I really loved it! I had watched the movie version in preparation, so it was fresh in my mind, and Aaron Sorkin's book is much (much) funnier than the original. Philippa Soo was absolutely AMAZING and Jordan Donica was also terrific. I found Andrew Burnap a bit weaker, as some others have said -- he was funny and good at being in over his head, but not as believable as an inspiring leader. The show was long but I didn't think it dragged at all. The costumes were gorgeous and the spare set worked for me.  
The one (somewhat sizeable) issue I had with the new book is that the ending completely undermined what, to me, is the point of the plot. The original musical is a tragedy -- Guinevere, Lancelot, and Arthur are all good people who love and respect one another and believe deeply in what they're building at Camelot, but all of that is destroyed because Guinevere and Lancelot's love is too powerful to resist. In this version, Guinevere never really loves Lancelot -- she's certainly attracted to him, but it's her jealousy of Arthur and Morgan le Fay that tips her into sleeping with him. We learn at the end that Guinevere and Arthur loved one another all along, but neither one ever said it to the other -- which makes the tragedy more of a silly misunderstanding.  
I found a lot of the choices really interesting -- removing all of the magic was effective, and I was definitely intrigued by the more distant relationship between Guinevere and Arthur all along and wondering how it would be resolved. But I think the ending is a mistake. It definitely didn't ruin the show for me -- I don't go to Broadway very often and I absolutely loved the experience. But to me that was the weakest part of the show.",KeyRecommendation270,7,24,0.92
54,Broadway showcase ideas - with children and teens,11uob6y,"During summer I will run a pilot musical theatre day camp (probably 3-5 full days) with a showcase at the end.
It's for children and teens. Ages around 7-16.
If this pilot runs well, in the future I might be able to do a lot more and the end goal is producing big musical theatre productions with children in it. Think Matilda, Annie, Sound of Music etc. 
I work for a semi-professionnal company but the summer camp will be for all children that want to participate.
For the productions we will hold auditions but not the case at this point. 

I am now looking at putting together a fun showcase for the pilot. Should I focus on one show? Or mixing different ones? 

I'm now thinking of 3 different age groups. All groups do a few songs with their group and some will be with all 3 together. 

Will we also do acting scenes or only focusing on the singing and dancing?

Anyone got some examples for me from showcases they did or saw? 

If you had to put together a showcase with children what would you do?

64,Follow Up on my Etiquette Question,11u8url,"Hello everyone,

I saw the BOM tour last Saturday night, and the entire cast was so phenomenal.  I will share my review on it, but before I do that, I'd like to follow up regarding the question I asked regarding etiquette. Before the show, I asked if I were to cheer after every song, if it would bother other audience members.  What ended up happening was that I didn't cheer after every single song, but I did after most of them since I felt that the majority of the songs were deserving of it.  Not only no one was bothered by this, but I wasn't even the only one that cheered after the songs, it really was an energetic crowd.  As a matter of fact, I Believe was the only number where I was the loudest at the end from what I recall, and given how I mentioned numerous times on here how it was that song that made me fall in love with the show, it shouldn't be surprising that I cheered so loudly after that song.  

I think the fact that I attended the Saturday night performance has a lot to do with it as Saturday night crowds tend to be quite energetic in general.  If I was attending a matinee, I'd be more understanding of why you wouldn't want me cheering after many of the songs since older folks typically attend matinee shows and I know they aren't a fan of cheering since back when they were young, cheering wasn't even a thing on Broadway.  Similarly, if I was seeing some Golden Age show like South Pacific, I'd also be understanding of you all not wanting me to cheer after many of the numbers since like I said, cheering at broadway shows was basically non existent during the Golden Age.  However, Book of Mormon is a fun, modern musical, so it's not really surprising that at Saturday night performances especially, the crowd is so lively for the show.

Just thought I'd follow up on this.",jonasnew,5,0,0.18

67,Need to rave about Moulin Rouge,11u5832,"Just spent a long car ride listening to the Moulin Rouge soundtrack again, and now I need to get all my love for it off my chest. This is literally going to just be me expressing my love for it, and hoping some other people will share their love for it too!

For some context: I have adored the film version of Moulin Rouge for my entire life. So coming into the Broadway version, I knew I would be a bit biased. 

That being said, I saw the touring cast last May in Chicago and absolutely fell in love. Conor Ryan was amazing, and Nicci Claspell was in for Satine for my show, and she was absolutely phenomenal. Then, when it was announced Aaron Tveit was coming back to Broadway for his limited run, I did indeed fly to NYC and back in less than a day to see him on his second day back. I thought I could not love the show more, but seeing Aaron in it was one of the most amazing things I’ve ever experienced.

I know this show and jukebox shows in general are quite divisive, and honestly, I don’t know if I’m the biggest fan of them usually. However, I just absolutely adore the idea that all of these modern songs are songs that were written by Christian about his love for Satine. It’s such a nice little way to justify it being a jukebox, and I just love the way the medleys are done. 

Rapid fire opinions: My holy trinity is Chandelier, Roxanne, and Crazy Rolling, like many others I assume. I don’t love Karen Olivo as Satine on the soundtrack (I literally don’t know anyone else’s take on this, so it could be widely agreed upon idk). I generally like the plot changes from screen to stage!

I’d love to hear other’s opinions of this show, and I’m hoping that it’s in my city for the next season. Thank you for reading this rant haha.",Existing_Pickle_9320,16,25,0.84
68,Musical of the Week,11u3qqd,"Musical: *Nine*

Music: Maury Yeston 

Lyrics: Maury Yeston

Book: Arthur Kopit

Premise (per Wikipedia): *Nine* is “based on Frederico Fellini’s semi-autobiographical 1963 film 8 1/2. The show tells the story of film director Guido Contini, who is dreading his imminent 40th birthday and facing a midlife crisis, which is blocking his creative impulses and entangling him in a web of romantic difficulties in early-1960s Venice.” 

*Nine* premiered on Broadway in 1982, directed by Tommy Tune and starring Raul Julia. It won 5 Tony Awards, including Best Musical. Its 2003 revival won Best Revival and Best Supporting Actress for Jane Krakowski. The revival cast included Antonio Banderas, Laura Benanti, and Chita Rivera. 

There is a film adaptation starring Daniel Day Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penelope Cruz, Judy Dench, and others. It can currently be found on HBO Max.

I have read the reviews on he over the last few weeks and just kinda figured as usual of our group just being overly critical. Nope. It’s going to bomb big. Sad because there’s some bones in some of the music. However they need to trim some songs out completely - too many solo ballads esp in second act. Shorten some songs. Cindy has a song in the second act before a transition to a bad Cindy reprise that goes one 2 verses longer than it should before the trans. Audible muttering in audience about it. Overall they fail to develop the two main characters… the queen, stepmom, and godmother all perform well and have decent lyrics and music… I think they try to fill the lack of character background on the mains with unnecessary songs. Oh, the theater was a total cluster fuck too… the staff was hair on fire. A pipe and drum band performed outside for half the first act completely overpowering the room. The ushers were obsessed w peoples phones - flashing lights and causing a commotion. Overall shit show in there.

I went to go see Shucked. No idea what I was expecting, but I had already heard some positive buzz. 

The show starts and I don’t know what it was, whether it was the free pins we got, the alcohol or something, but the audience last night was crazy! I don’t mean that in a negative way, they were just very very reactive, shouting back at the actors and the action with commentary. Has anyone else experienced this with Shucked so far? 

Maybe the show is just that special and unique, I don’t know. The show is absurdly funny and very self-aware while also having some tender and sweet moments. I’m definitely a fan of the music, which is my biggest determinator as to whether or not I’ll like a show. I do think that there are some things that aren’t working or landing just yet, but these are mainly small things compared to other shows I’ve seen this season (Ahem, Andrew…).

84,Confused by Seat Papering Services - Has Anyone Found a Good Service for Broadway Tickets?,11tit77,"I recently signed up to a few seat papering services, including Theaterextras, Gold Club, Pay by Play, Show-Score, and Club Free Time, in an attempt to get access to Broadway tickets. However, I quickly found out that these services do not actually offer any Broadway tickets, and the events they do offer often misrepresent what they actually are. For example, a concert at Carnegie Hall was described as a well-received orchestra from an American flyover state, but it turned out to be a high school band. Other events ask for a minimum food order of $25 per person, or have a full ticket price of $15, making the administrative charge of $4.50 not much different from just buying a full price ticket.   

I also noticed that papering services seem to copy each other, one papering service will get a listing and just like a newspaper copying another newspaper's headline it looks like the other papering services phone the producer and get a listing themselves. It makes me wonder are they just trying to get people to show up to events that no one wants to go to and they are using the bait of some rare Broadway ticket as bait to get people to pay attention, hungry for that potential ticket to show up.  

I'm wondering if I'm being unreasonable in my expectations, or if I'm simply looking at the wrong time or wrong papering services. Are there any better papering services out there that actually offer Broadway tickets? Has anyone had a good experience with them? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",kittenball_nyc,26,6,0.67
85,Saw Moulin Rouge tonight! Some comments...,11tis6j,"I saw Moulin Rouge tonight! I bought my ticket mainly to see the actors rather than the show itself - I'm not sure why but I've just not had much interest in it. I have never seen the movie, and I have only seem clips of the Broadway show here or there. My friend I was with went in entirely blind and was stunned when they started singing the mid 2010s repertoire lol.

I'm super glad I saw the show, the acting and singing was incredible. I think of all the shows I've seen (I think this is my 35th in the past 6 years since I stated seeing shows) this had the most stellar singers cast in the show. Not a note was missed, and I felt like everyone was EXCEPTIONAL. I've also seen reviews saying that Ashley and Aaron have little chemistry, and I completely disagree. I think the only thing I didn't like from the casting was that Ashley read to be in her early 20s while the leader of the Moulin Rouge seemed to characterize her as someone much older.

My personal comments on the show: Act 1 did not pull me in at all, but I felt enraptured by Act 2. The storyline was kinda slow and whatever in Act 1, but it really picked up later. I absolutely loved all the dancing in Bad Romance and Chandelier, where was this in Act 1 (aside from the CanCan number I guess which felt sloppy to me)? The opening making me feel like I was in the Moulin Rouge and at a club rather than the theatre really took me out of the show because I began focusing on everyone around me and people getting to their seats still. I was never entirely drawn in by the show  - I didn't have a strong connection with the characters at all and the choppiness and lack of flow of the sets made me feel like I was watching vignettes of a movie where I couldn't remember the character's names.

Set design and lighting was spectacular - I loved the way that the entire theatre is incorporated and the only other show I can think of that I've seen that did that has been Cats.

I'm curious if anyone else also feels this way - I hate the fact that it's a jukebox musical. I didn't feel as if the tunes were jammed in and didn't fit (except for the ""love"" song towards the end of Act 1 that had like 20 different love songs in it), but outside of the music everything else is so great I think it would have flowed a lot better if it had all original music. Even if the music isn't great (I'm looking at you Some Like it Hot), I think it would pull the show together as a whole. The only other jukebox show I've seen has been the off-broadway revival of Rock of Ages at New World Stages. I went into that show blind as well and came out LOVING IT. I thought their use of the music was perfect and I can't imagine it with any other music. I repeatedly listen to the cast album for that show. I don't think I'll be doing that for Moulin Rouge. I can't seem to figure out exactly why I feel this way though but I think its mainly because the music doesn't fit the time or really even theming for the most part of the show.

Final comment - the audience SUCKED. There was a constant level of chatter and so much movement. I don't think I've ever seen that many people use the bathroom in the middle of a show. I heard so many shushes, and EVERY SONG as soon as people knew what it was there was a wave of oohs and chuckles. Also so many phones ringing, alarms going off, people trying to record video. Once again, it really took me out of the moment it was honestly absurd.

I think I sound really crabby in this review, I apologize. I did really enjoy my time, and it is quite the spectacle. On my ranked list of favorite shows I put it in 15th place, above Kiss Me Kate and below Phantom of the Opera. Overall I'm giving it a 7.5/10.

86,Another Spoiler Review of Sweeney Todd (from an annoying British person who loved the Imelda Staunton production),11th0ka,"I needed somewhere to vent and discuss with fellow Toddians. I will clarify firstly, I love Sweeney Todd. I grew up with both the film but also the Lansbury DVD recording. So as much as it makes me biased, it also makes me annoyingly hypercritical. Added to that, I saw Imelda Staunton and Michael Ball in Sweeney Todd in Chichester, before it transferred to London which I loved. They made it feel fresh and DARK, moving it to the 1930s and really playing into the serial killer aspect.

So me and my friend got tickets an hour before the show tonight and were sat at the back of the orchestra - another thing to take into account, as it maybe swayed my opinion, but we both didn't take much issue with our spot. We also had Groban's understudy, Nicholas Christopher, who was great.

Overall, I enjoyed this show. I didn't love it. My main qualm is the staging and choreography. This is a big stage, why is everything consistently static and downstage. Here is again where I am cursed with comparison. I've got to say, as much as I respect a bold idea for using the bridge as the shop - it just didn't work for me. It created visual restriction with the cables of the bridge intruding visually on performers on the chair for a start. Maybe I'm a purist, but I missed the shop in the middle of the stage as a two tier block and the revolve too. In scenes where either we have the Greek Chorus, or scenes happening concurrently, rather than just being able to use a revolve to keep things moving or just flicking between the two in the shop, separating them between the bridge and then other areas of the stage felt clunky. I respect the attempt to modernize but there seemed to be moments throughout where it felt like the choreography and modern choices would clash with the production. 

Also quick question, does Pirelli's hand coming out of the trunk usually happen in this production? Or is it just not in this production? Found that an odd omission and adds to my point of craving a little bit more black humor in the show - it didn't feel manic enough for me! Ashleigh definitely had moments but wanted just a bit more!

I'm looking forward to seeing it again maybe in 6 months to see if I grow to love this more than enjoying seeing a very well performed production, but this did feel strangely sparse but lacking edge. The chorus didn't feel realized enough either - there was no identity to their characters (again maybe previews). 

As expected, the accents are a bit wonky. I actually found Gaten probably had the closest accent, especially in act one. But we definitely travelled thousands of miles in one show according to the accents tonight. But that's a pet peeve and not surprising.

Anyway that's my venting, but genuinely this show sounds AMAZING. I'm hoping as it progresses they'll smooth out the show, ironically to find some more edge. Annaleigh Ashford is so different to Lansbury and Staunton but I could only respect it, and whilst it took a second to adjust, it's a completely different interpretation so that was refreshing to see! 

Added to that, for Nicholas Christopher's first night, he sounded stunning and really commanded the stage. Whilst curious to see Groban in the future, I was definitely satisfied with Christopher. No disappointment there whatsoever, nor should there be. 

Overall, glad to have seen a new production. Did I leave wanting a little more? Yes but it was still a very enjoyable evening. Interested in hearing thoughts.",judidenchasacat,7,19,0.86

88,White Girl in Danger is an absolute mess,11tfjgc,"At this point, the best thing I can say is that I hope it improves as they preform it. It just has very little to say (barring 20 mins at the end, it has nothing to say). It's also covered in that South Park cringe humor mascaraing as cutting social commentary (but it's such thin and parroted commentary that it hardly needs repeating). 

I loved A Strange Loop. I saw it 4 times and took multiple people to it. So I know that he's a talented writer and I hope he can turn this around, but it's just a mess to the point of white noise. 

You can mess with structure and be meta, but you have to give the audience something to hold on to and follow. Characters, themes, emotion, or anything for the audience to attach to. 

It wasn't that it was challenging or uncomfortable or hard to understand. It was that it was boring. Everything just changed and changed and changed with no point or respect to the characters or audience. And then it ended and at least we got to go home.",toastontuesday,61,57,0.93

99,Review of Current Musicals,11t2n38,"Inspired by the positive post about amateur reviews, I'm going to share my very first on this subreddit! Over the past two months or so, I've taken advantage of cheap deals to go through a lot of new-ish musicals with relatively affordable tickets before the tourist season hits. Please bear with my long rambling thoughts!

**Moulin Rouge** (with Ashley & Aaron)
Pro: Spectacle is out of this world. Gorgeous costumes, insane sets. Sword swallowing! Aerial silk dancers! (Don't be like me, arrive early to see the pre-show). But the real sell honestly for me is Aaron. I did not know him from Les Mis but I kid you not, I kept muttering to myself (silently, I'm a good audience member xD), ""Wow he's so hot"" and ""Wow he sounds incredible"" and ""Wow this acting"". I can see that in other hands this romance might've been shallow and this book flop but in his, I really did feel for Christian and his idealism/naivety felt so *sweet* instead of dumb, it's absolutely understandable why Satine would've wanted to protect him while also not being able to resist. Just 10/10 singing & acting and 20/10 charisma. 
Con: The ensemble ""found family"" narrative didn't have enough scenes to really be felt - it lacked ""heart""? Some of the jukebox music is actually pretty silly and they crammed so many songs in it made it even sillier. And most of the songs were not superior to their original version, or used in any particularly clever ways. This may be controversial, but Ashley was a wonderful singer but a weak actress. Compared to Aaron, she left me wondering what was so special about Satine and left me cold at the dilemma/tragedy. 
Other notes: the far side orchestra seats from lottery is partial view but actually really great, you get super close to the ensemble and stars, I do recommend this route. 
OVERALL: I actively want to re-see this show, which is really quite rare. I know I put a handful of cons there but please go while Aaron is still in the role. I can't speak to Derek but Aaron made me understand why people say ""worth the price of admission.""

*Kimberly Akimbo**
Pro: Wonderful book, and unlike many others on Broadway. Grounded and funny and heartwrenching in turns. Like the best play but a musical. Victoria Clark does an absolutely stellar job - she really FEELS like a teenage girl. But I also really enjoyed Justin Cooley. 
Con: It's... like a play, but a musical. I didn't /know/ that was its origins until afterwards, but I'd suspected it strongly. The songs are pleasant but mostly feel like an afterthought, grafted to the scenes and dialogue. The book sort of derails at the end, with the crime plot that you don't even see, though the moving ending sticks the landing. 
Other notes: Got seated in orchestra via TDF. Wonderful seat, rec going this route. 
OVERALL: Go if you generally like slice of life plays, and keep away expectations of life changing music or singing. 

**&Juliet**
Pro: Clever meta plot, really creative uses of the jukebox songs (how they used I Want It That Way by NSYNC still crack me up, lol). Also, the more you know about Shakespeare and Romeo & Juliet, the more some of these jokes will land. 
Con: Surprisingly lacked heart (to me)? I just felt things were corny and too on the nose instead of being moved by them, from Ann's monologues to Juliet's frustration to May's struggles. Like, I got ""bad"" goosebumps at some finger snap lines, and I'm the sort of queer young liberal who studied feminist lit this seems directly targeted at. Didn't help that I thought it was weaker singing & acting than I usually get at Broadway shows. The day I went had a LOT of alternates including Juliet, Romeo, AND May, so maybe it was just my bad luck and the regulars are better at acting, singing, and overall chemistry. 
OVERALL: I'd gotten to go for free (thanks to another reddit member here!), but in retrospect would only go for rush or lottery prices. Potentially my expectations were too high but I left feeling disappointed anyway. 

**SLIH**
Pro: I feel like everyone knows it already, but stellar cast, stellar dancing & spectacle, an updated and effective book, totally solid jazz-esque songs (further elevated by the cast). I want to note I'm cis but I thought how they handled Daphne and Osgood was great, I actually got teary when Osgood sang to Daphne about a butterfly and shared his life story, and also his wink nudge about knowing it all along was a great choice. Really subtle acting by Harrison Ghee & Kevin del Aguila. And on that note, truly no weak links in this cast! I was blown away by basically everybody. 
Con: I don't know? Music isn't ""innovative""? Some people don't like comedy? But I think the latter's a taste thing and not music doesn't have to be innovative to be good. I'm not listening to the soundtrack at home but I enjoyed them immensely during the show.
OVERALL: By far the best all-rounder and ""traditional"" in the best sense. This reminded me of the musicals that were the reasons why I fell in love with musicals in the past. 

**Camelot**
Pro: Philippa Soo. She sounded like an angel, looked like the most beautiful woman in the entire world, and played Guinevere's fiery slash petty slash whipsmart personality to perfection - I think she really elevated this role. Andrew Burnap and Jordan Donica were also great, I could nitpick each performance a bit but honestly it's hard to say how much of it is performance shortcomings vs the book's failures. If you see this show, it's for the cast (and maybe the orchestra? I'm not inclined this way but they were notably good)
Con: The new book is incredibly frustrating. I'm a giant Sorkin fan. Is it funny and snappy, like every Sorkin script? Yes, and I was entertained the entire time. But it is the PERFECT example of the common Sorkin critique, that his characters say lots of funny smart-sounding things without ever really TALKING and when you blink after two hours, he's hardly engaged with the real themes of the work. Democracy & how you must strive towards idealism regardless of how badly the world turns? The confines of female gender roles? What love really is (not lust, but supporting each other to be who we are)? The plot points including the love triangle conclusion were exactly what I want, which makes the execution even more maddening. And people are absolutelt correct, a bad ending will sour impressions, and this one was so corny and abrupt. Add to that the music, which was too lighthearted and a bad fit for this social satire / political drama / romantic drama / tragedy (and yes, this scattered tone was by itself a big issue of the book). Finally, truly I hated this theater, it felt so uncomfortable and cavernous. I understand a minimalist set to highlight the allegorical aspects of this story, but I felt like even the actors must've been annoyed by constantly having to cross that giant set. And I was like, 3 rows back but still feel like I wasn't as close as I wanted to be. 
OVERALL: I love Philippa Soo, I really do. But I absolutely would not sit through this show to see her again. And I'm glad I paid <$40 for my seat. It IS an entertaining show, but definitely ""mixed emotions"" - where the highs are real high but the lows really build up over time, lol. 

**SHUCKED**
Pro: I'm going to cheat and say to look at my recent comments about Shucked on this subreddit 😅 Absolutely hilarious, wholesome, original music with solid cast (Alex Newell & Grey Handson are my picks for standouts, everyone else was servicable). The audience went seriously wild for this at my random Weds 8pm preview show. 
Con: It's like popcorn, satisfying and delicious but won't actually provide any nutrients. The music and book both lack ""heart"" and a deeper layer of conflict that make a musical linger. Staging also was not as impressive as I expect from Broadway, it was basically one set with a couple of big moving props. But you know, sometimes it's just not that serious. Sometimes you just want a good time at the theater. This is it, guaranteed. I'd appreciate them deleting the sort-of homophobic jokes though. It was funny until they implied the character was a closeted dude obsessed with size. 
OVERALL: Go for a reasonable price. I *suspect* this will explode once officially open though, in which case I rec waiting until it inevitably tours or have regional productions. It seems absolutely perfect for that. I wouldn't particularly rush to see this iteration unless you love Newell.",romanticdrift,12,42,0.92

101,The Shark is broken Toronto review (2022),11t047h,"I am very convoluted on this show because I don’t exactly know how to rate it, I find that the people who watch this show are gonna think “what the hell was that?” As it’s basically 3 men in a boat talking. I somewhat think they don’t understand that the piece was made as a tribute to Ian Shaw’s late father; I don’t think this show would have worked if Ian wasn’t playing his father because that relationship is so strong. Since his father died when he was younger you can’t help but think exactly what Ian was thinking writing the play which explains how his father felt during the one of the biggest moments of his career. It kind of plays into that concept of not knowing or “what could have been” with his late father and what he thought Robert would have acted on set despite not being near him for too long himself. If you remove Ian from the show this all fades away, and without him it just doesn’t work. It’s long and the script wouldn’t hit as hard. This is the perspective I believe many went into the theatre with which is why they consider it to be “bad” but for me; it works as a personal piece.",uctpe251990,0,4,0.75
102,Kimberly Akimbo vs. Shucked,11sxh48,"Kimberly Akimbo is one of the best shows to hit Broadway in years. It knows exactly the story it wants to tell, doesn’t rely on edgy puns or innuendos, and has so much heart and love put into it with its cast of characters. I haven’t cried as much at the end of Kimberly Akimbo as I have in years at any show. This show is a major contender for the Tony’s this year as it is an incredible piece of art that tells a wonderful, hilarious, and beautiful story of a family that is unstable and doesn’t realize what they have until it’s gone.

Shucked, on the other hand, is a two and a half hour walk through Cobb county with every single line being an edgy innuendo or nonsensical pun about corn that drags out every little corn fueled pun for all it has. By the one hour mark, I’m absolutely exhausted, drained, and just want the show to wrap up. It under utilized its biggest vocal talent, Alex Newlell, for only a single solo, which deserves at least another one in act 2. This show has potential, but it currently uses what it has to tell a cliche romance story and throws it’s funny and original corn story to the back burner until the end.",kwhiggs8,12,0,0.33

107,Bad Cinderella - Standing O.,11svcee,"I had a night off last night so I bought a ticket to Bad Cinderella in a moment of weakness. I bought a $48 ""partial view"" ticket which was the first row of the rear mezz, and it was actually a fantastic seat. Would buy this seat forever moving forward at the Imperial in the future. That said, the ushers at this show were... odd. They were OVERLY enthusiastic and, based on what I heard come out of several of their mouths to different people, it almost seemed like they'd been given a script.

One of them was going around telling people ""you cannot take pictures during the show but you absolutely are allowed to take pictures during the standing ovation!""  She didn't call it bows or curtain call - she said standing ovation. This was before the show started. I know standing o's don't really mean much anymore, unfortunately, because every performance nowadays seems to get a standing o, no matter how good or bad.. but it was still weird and felt presumptuous.  Then another usher came up to the people sitting next to me before the show just gushing about how the show is so great and how they were really just going to love the show, and she said (verbatim) ""you're just really going to love this show! You know how I know? Because every night there's a standing ovation! Every night! That's how you know the show is good - you're gonna love it!""  As the lights were going down she came back and said to the same people ""look at how full it is! Like this every night - people love it, it's so good!""

Then, in the dark as bows started, another usher ran up to our row in the front and pantomimed taking pictures with our phone and pointed at us, then went back to pantomiming taking pics and said, over the music, ""now you can stand and take pictures!!""

Is this really what they're doing? Forcing their staff to push a ""standing ovation"" and put in peoples' heads that that show is 1. good before it even starts, and 2. that's what makes a good show on Broadway? How many people bought tickets at TKTS? Good grief. It really felt like the staff was told to weigh in, which I've never seen before. Also, for all of that, not one of them scanned my ticket or checked my bag. I could have walked right in without a ticket in hand and been just fine.

Lastly, it was a train wreck. It wasn't just bad... it didn't make sense. I like ALW's weird intervals and chords, but even within songs, everything felt disjointed and like it was Frankensteined together. Also if you're familiar with his catalogue, it's very clear that he took A LOT from Woman in White, Stephen Ward, Evita, JCS, and even a little Sunset and Starlight. Nothing really worked and I felt like I was on an amusement park ride that kept taking unexpected 90 degree turns in weird directions. The lead was an understudy making her Bway debut, and she had trouble singing the role, but I'm going to chalk it up to nerves. The performances were as dedicated and good as they could have been, but holy hell if this show was anyone but ALW it wouldn't have ever seen the light of day.

The only thing that I really loved was that it has an Entra'cte, and I wish shows would bring that back. One thing that ALW does super well, and the most enjoyable parts of this show for me, are the strictly instrumental numbers. And somehow the orchestra sounded more lush than you'd think based on the size. Lastly, why is the merch so good?! Wasted on this show, but it was cute.

Edit: ALSO! It's been bothering me until just now, but I just figured out the song ""I Know I Have a Heart"" reminds me of Russell Brand's big song in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" ""Inside of You"" lol. Maybe that's just me.

Edit 2: Sort of an aside, I feel like Andrew Lloyd Webber began to lean hard in to the repeating, equally weighted quarter notes as his signature style around the time of The Beautiful Game, so maybe that's also why all of his newer stuff sounds the same (in addition to blatantly re-using material).",im_not_bovvered,68,150,0.95

116,(Another) Camelot review,11sjba3,"Well this was a fun one. Other reviewers have nailed it so far, but I thought I’d add more color since it’s such a new show. 

The good:
- yes it’s true, Philippa Soo is worth all the hype so much hype she’s wonderful. She flounced around the stage in her gorgeous capes and trains, she destroyed all her songs and lines, and I thought she added nuance to Guinevere, who is often played as a flat philandering siren who screws up the entire perfect court. 

- The floor projections bring a lot of the staging to life. From the loge I didn’t have any problems with the set being relatively sparse—the stage itself, like the actual wood, is beautiful and I loved the medieval screens they incorporated. They also have a nice scene where the grand marriage bed kind of follows Guinevere and Lancelot around, and it works. 

- Arthur was amazing? The actor nailed the classic Sorkin delivery of each joke… it was like seeing a young Josh Lyman as king, which I swear is enjoyable. I also found his singing beautiful, and an interesting counterpoint to the very rich and formal singing from Lancelot. 

- The love triangle ending really REALLY worked for me. As a fantasy romance reader, I was RABID when Arthur and Guinevere confessed their love and had one last, forbidden kiss. 

The bad:
- It’s definitely long, as everyone has noted. I truly don’t know what else could be cut. The dialogue didn’t drag or feel cheesy EXCEPT for the kid at the end. Please spare us. 

- The knights were so comically evil. It made me question Arthur’s judgment to have them in his round table. Maybe we’re supposed to see how flawed he is, and how bad of a ruler.

- Agreed that the music felt too light for the subject matter. Sometimes it almost felt like parody having some bouncy jaunty music in the back while a kingdom is crumbling. 

- The seats. The seats! They’re so tiny and squished, at least in the loge. I’m a 5’8”, size 10/12 woman and I was hugging my elbows the whole time. If you’re fluffy, be prepared to squeeze.


ETA: I thought of another thing they could work on. 

The Morgan Le Fay character isn’t great. She’s a scientist who lives in a creepy dungeon, who can apparently See the future (the future is science), and she’s not an alcoholic but everyone thinks she is. Maybe it’s because I read The Mists of Avalon at an impressionable age, but I think she could be much more layered. Arthur is kind of her mirror: he impregnated her at 15 and then immediately became king and had to rule as an unprepared king. Morgan was presumably the same age, and she had to become a mother as an unprepared girl. She can be warped and bitter over time, but it would be nice to see some real anger directed at Arthur for just leaving her behind versus a general weirdness that’s funneled into her terrible son.",seejeynerun,30,37,0.98

I saw it tonight and that whole show needs to be cut by like 45 minutes.

EDIT: Fine I’ll elaborate a little bit lmfao the show’s pacing was poor, a majority of the songs were not memorable, it was a non stop punch line fest that didn’t know if it wants to be edgy or not, Alex Newell literally only has one solo while Beau has three, the corn plot is abandoned entirely for a cliché, done 1000 times romance plot until the very end, and it just had me wanting it to end because it was so exhausting and slow at some point.",kwhiggs8,117,105,0.68

135,Question about Broadway strike/load-outs.,11s4j1p,"Someone had mentioned one of the things about Broadway vs. touring was ""you can cut into the stage"". This made me wonder - are Broadway stages merely a big chasm of a swimming pool that each show builds the deck on and configures their own orchestra pit (if it's below stage)? Someone said they thought the Imperial's turntable was a permanent fixture.

I know some shows will raise the deck to get their automation such as turntables and tracks inside, and they'll create pits and lifts as necessary. Are they contracted to replace the stage floor on load out or is that left for the next tenant? I understand the Majestic is getting completely renovated after Phantom but their deck is riddled with traps and slots and tracks for the candles and automation. If a new tenant was moving in immediately, would it be their job to replace that if they wanted a smooth deck for a rollerskating number? Or are production companies contracted to leave the theater in default usable condition with a new deck when they vacate? I suppose it varies by contract?",HanonOndricek,9,24,1.0

147,Bad Cinderella NY preview thoughts,11rq51m,"Ohhhh my god you guys. Just saw tonight’s preview showing of Bad Cinderella and it was abysmal. Show began 45 minutes late because every single scanner was down and all audience digital tickets had to be individually printed, holding up a line of hundreds. Not the show’s fault, sure. But Bad Cinderella was an inconsistent, plot-hole filled disaster wrapped in a pseudo-rebel ALW bow. The predictable storyline contains uninspired dialogue which somehow manages to make gay subplots and important messages about societal beauty standards and conformity sound corny and out of touch. The lead couldn’t pick a character direction to save her life, creating a confusing and annoying protagonist who would switch in and out of accents and personalities. I cringed in my seat several times when her acting would not land and “comedic” moments of her character only garnered a few scattered laughs. Costumes could have been interesting should they have remained consistent—steampunk-esc corsets and undergarments do not belong with traditional ball attire, so pick a theme and stick with it (plus my god Cinderella’s ball gown felt tacky. Lyrics and music were so ridiculously elementary it puts the entire art of theater to shame.

150,A Doll's House Review,11rlcom,"My boyfriend and I saw A Doll's House tonight and loved it. Im an actor who's seen many broadway shows and this one was different, but awesome. It's uniqueness made it really interesting. I think the stripped down version of the play highlighted the wittiness of the text that might be overlooked with crazy costumes and set pieces. The actors got to be super specific, and I could see that they were having fun connecting with us! 

If you are looking for a flashy, very typical, very traditional Broadway play, then this of course is not for you. But then why are you looking at seeing an Ibsen play in the first place??

If you, however, appreciate great acting and classic storytelling, this will be for you. As another reviewer said beforehand, you can't come in with any preconceived, egotistical idea of what you want to experience. Just be present, and let the story take you where it leads you! This felt like an authentic and entertaining live theater experience.

It was beautiful, funny, and heartbreaking. Performances from Chastain and Michael Patrick Thorton were what stuck out to me the most (although I also loved arian's bits towards the end). My boyfriend and I both cried, laughed, and felt like the time flew by (He's a finance guy, btw!) Our audience as a whole seemed to really enjoy it too - lots of laughing and engagement. Everyone gave it a standing ovation, and it looked like a sold out theater! I'm seriously confused by all the negativity on this page. 

Also, all of the actors stagedoored afterwards, were super kind, and took their time with everyone.

156,Shucked felt much more Jesus-y than I expected,11reyur,"I was lucky enough to get cheap seats to Shucked last night. Overall, I feel positively about the show. The jokes come thick and fast, and while not all of them landed, there were plenty of laugh-out-loud moments for me. The performances, especially the singing, are great. While I didn't feel like the songs themselves were particularly memorable, I think the singing was world-class. Alex Newell is absolutely the standout, and their big song was the best of the show for me. 

That said, I couldn't get past the feeling that maybe I wasn't part of the target audience for the show - which is okay of course. It's not exactly the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, but it's NOT Book of Mormon style humor either - I've seen that comparison a few times now.

The show is very careful to point out that all of the residents of Cobb County are bible-carrying Christians. It's never preachy or even religious, but the characters reference Jesus and Christianity often. For instance, in a number in which nearly the whole cast sings, the much-repeated refrain is >!""We love Jesus, but we drink a little."" !<And it gets a reprise at the end. In fact, the show ends with >!a callback joke about bibles.!<

Now, I'm not saying Jesus doesn't belong on Broadway or that every show has to be targeted to some hypothetical hard-boiled NYC audience. Honestly, I think many people will find all this rather overblown. But for some of us with non-Christian backgrounds, a show that works very hard to let you know that all of it's characters are bible-toting Christians can bring up some odd feelings. I think the show is funny, and I hope it'll be a success, but I figured this was worth mentioning.",IWantYorkBitesBack,61,124,0.79

I'm trying to see Moulin Rouge on March 28th because I'll be in the city for an audition that day. I waited too long on a great deal for a front left orchestra seat on SeatGeek and it's gone :( I could get a second mezzanine seat for the same price but I'm not sure about the view (sidebar: has anyone seen the show from that level and if so is it still as much of a spectacle?). Scoring the lottery would be great but I'd just be afraid to wait that long to get a seat, and then not win the lottery, and then like not be able to see it at all, yanno? I know it's only a Tuesday but still I feel like lottery odds are hit or miss. And as my last option, I was curious if anyone has ever tried doing the NYTix digital discount lottery thing?

& Juliet - digital rush ticket, center mezz row DD. I normally hate mezz but this was a pretty decent seat. Lots of understudies including the amazing Rachel Webb for Juliet. Betsy Wolfe was the highlight for me. I grew up in the 90s so this was right up my alley. I had a ton of fun and it was a great way to start my weekend

Kimberly Akimbo - in-person rush, orchestra right row B. Partially obstructed due to a completely unnecessary chair in the scenes that take place in Kimberly's house. I could still mostly see but people further over or closer probably missed quite a bit. I loved this show, it was my main reason for coming on this trip. Victoria Clark was out, which I knew. Colleen was great, but the supporting cast outshone her a little bit. I cried a few times. I'd love to see it again, I hope it tours.

Shucked - when I was planning my trip I really wasn't sure what would go in this slot. I thought maybe Parade, but in the end I decided to go with this (which was fortunate, since the corresponding performance of Parade was cancelled). I ended up buying my Shucked ticket the day before at the box office, willing to spend a bit since I saved money nabbing rush for & Juliet. A lot has been said about this show already. I laughed a ton and didn't care that it was mostly puns and one-liners. The storytellers and Alex Newell were the standouts for me. I sat second row mezz on the aisle (knowing leg room is terrible up there) and had a great view. 

Sweeney Todd - I was really impressed with this. I was skeptical of Josh and Annaleigh headed in, and bought my ticket for Ruthie Anne Miles (who blew me away as expected), but both leads really pleasantly surprised me. I sat orchestra left row H, had a fantastic view with no obstructions (although I think orch right might be the better choice for this production). As a bonus I ran into Martin Short at intermission. The show started at about 315 and I wasn't on the street until after 6. Hopefully they tighten it up as previews go on.

Titanique - Sunday evening options are slim, and I'd already seen Little Shop twice, so I took a chance on this. I don't have any strong feelings about Celine Dion, but I love Titanic. This was fun and worth the 33 dollars I paid, but it didn't leave much of an impression on me. I did have another female lead understudy with Courtney Bassett going on as Celine, she was really great. I sat up in the cheap seats, row P, but it's probably way more fun up close

186,The Heartbreak of BAD CINDERELLA.,11qegee,"I saw the matinee of Bad Cinderella yesterday, and I can’t stop thinking about it. Not because it was bad — it was — but because it didn’t have to be. There’s a great show in there, there really is. But the way it’s put together is poorly structured, poorly motivated, poorly resolved, and amounts to little more than a thick, jumbled, Webber-coated slice of theatrical disappointment. I want to talk about it. Heck, I want to fix it! But to do so, we’re going to have to talk spoilers.

If you don’t want the show “spoiled” for you, step away from this thread right now. If you’ve seen the show and want to talk about it, or know the show and want to dish, let’s go.

My take is below but the tl;dr is above. The show is bad. Like, really, really bad. Despite a very talented cast who were trying their best to make magic with the terrible deck they’d been dealt. But it didn’t have to be. And, without much work, it could have been really great. Read on.

THE GOOD

There are many stellar performances in the show. Linedy Genao has a modern, mesmerizing voice as Cinderella. Carolee Carmella is a campy delight as the Wicked Stepmother. I want to put Jordan Dobson’s Prince Sebastian in my pocket and make him toddle around with me. The talent is top notch.

So’s the set. The stage and lighting are dynamic, clever, and powerful. At its best, good set, lighting and sound design bring depth to the story — they pull you in. That’s true in spades here. It’s moody. And fantastic. And it fills the stage. (Sure, I could have done without the turntable; but that seems to be a requirement on Broadway these days — if the stage don’t turn are you even on Broadway?)

THE BAD

Here’s the thing. Everything else is bad. A talented cast, a beautiful set, powerful lighting, clever costuming and a gifted orchestra here are crippled by a terribly constructed story, horribly arranged. And no amount of talent can save them.

Do you know about Chekhov’s gun? Chekhov wrote, about storytelling, that “If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off” and it’s like Bad Cinderella takes place in a gun store, and the bullets are in the next city over.

Bad Cinderella’s necklace that she won’t part with? Meaningless. Cinderella’s war with her stepmother over her father’s house? Pointless. Her stepmother’s threat to expose the queen? Idle. Godmother’s warning about midnight? Meritless. A hint that Cinderella is royalty? Unimportant. Prince Sebastian’s marriage-against-his-will? Doesn’t happen. With the possible exception of Prince Charming’s return (an absolutely delightful deus ex machina), there is nothing foreshadowed in this show that comes to fruition. And that’s a problem.

Do you know that trope about rom-coms? About how all of the drama in most rom-coms could be resolved in a single conversation? If the two lover simply talked to each other, they’d discover there is no conflict? And the audience just needs to suspend their disbelief a bit and go along with the romance of it all? 

This entire show it built on that trope — and then we double and triple down on it. Sebastian can’t tell Cinderella he loves her. Cinderella can’t go to the ball. Cinderella needs to be something she’s not. Sebastian needs to be something he’s not. Sebastian can’t recognize Cinderella’s voice. Cinderella can’t get to the church fast enough. Sebastian thinks Cinderella left town. Cinderella thinks Sebastian is married. And none of it is true! These two have been best friends since childhood and yet they don’t seem capable of even basic communication with each other until the FINAL MOMENT OF THE SHOW. Sweet merciful Christmas, that’s a lot of suspension of disbelief.

And worse, this beautiful, talented cast is crippled into roles with no agency, and no motivation. The leads make arbitrary decisions — I guess based on the lies they tell themselves? — that defy explanation. Sebastian literally tells Cinderella to come to the ball exactly as she is and so … she gives away the only thing she’s ever told us she valued (her necklace) to transform into exactly what he’s already told her he doesn’t want?!? I thought the ONE thing we knew about Bad Cinderella was that she was a non-conformist strong-assed woman who doesn’t need to be like everyone else? Why does she abandon her agency again? Why does she abandon who she is again? Why is that a thing she needs to do? Fork if I know.

THE FIX

Here’s the thing. For all of my complaints, the real reason I’m so riled up is because it didn’t have to be this way! The pieces are all there. The motivations are all there. It’s just structured seemingly without the slightest thought as to what it wants to be — what it so clearly dreams of being. Bad Cinderella. A fresh new look at Cinderella through a modern lens. 

So let me tell you the story the way it should be:

ACT 1:

Our show opens in Belleville Town Square. We get to know the townspeople (BUNS ’N’ ROSES / BEAUTY IS OUR DUTY) and we come to know that this town values beauty and conformity above all else. Everyone looks similar. Everyone dresses similarly. Cool. We also learn that Prince Charming is gone and likely never to return , that his brother, Prince Sebastian is not ready to lead (or conform). 

We are led to believe that Belleville is idyllic and perfect and flawless except for that bad apple Cinderella (BAD CINDERELLA) who isn’t interested in conforming and is a bit of an outlaw. She sees the world the way it really is, and tries — through, ahem, the graphic arts (she a graffiti artist, not merely a vandal) — to get her message across. Cinderella defaces the Prince Charming statue — and many other walls in the town, over the course of the song — and is rounded up, captured, and exiled from Belleville.

But Prince Sebastian rescues her. And we learn that the two of them have been friend for many years (SO LONG). He likes her. He likes her use of color. He likes her lack of conformity. We discover, too, that Prince Sebastian has been pining for Cinderella for years.

Cinderella attempts to slip back home like nothing happened, but her stepsisters won’t have that. We meet Cinderella’s stepsisters and her stepmother, and learn that the chateau they’re living in is actually Cinderella’s father’s. They sing about how hard ‘life’ is (UNFAIR) while Cinderella toils around them, putting up with their treatment as an alternative to homelessness and exile. But she’s not defeated. Oh no. She’s a strong independent woman, and their hatred only makes her stronger (EASY TO BE ME). Good for her! 

In the palace, things aren’t going well for Sebastian. He’s not a hunk. He’s not a leader. He’s not interested in conformity. He’s not the man that Belleville needs (HUNK’S SONG). Worse, he needs to be that man. He’s gotta step up, he’s got to take his brother’s place. He’s got to get married and save Belleville (MAN’S MAN). That sucks! Poor Sebastian just wants to be happy. 

But he’s not happy. So he goes to the woods to seek out the one person who might understand him. Cinderella. He meets her in the woods (because she’s still exiled from Belleville) and he pours his heart out to her (ONLY YOU, LONELY YOU). 

But she’s not interested in rescuing him from the mess he’s in. She’s not interested in playing games or pretending. She’s not looking for some Prince to save (BAD CINDERELLA REPRISE), she’s done with Belleville and moving on.

Poor Sebastian! So he abandons who he is (I’M NO LONGER ME) and agrees to his mom’s plan for a ball followed immediately by a wedding. He agrees that he’ll kiss a girl at midnight, and marry her the next day.

So everybody in Belleville is excited about the ball (and the wedding), and Sebastian is resigned to his role. As the townspeople parade themselves for Sebastian (THE VILLAGE SQUARE), Cinderella tries to sneak out of town. But Sebastian! Her only friend! Can she abandon him? He sees her! He calls out to her! But the villagers build a human barricade and shield him from her, decry how ugly she is and how unwelcome she is, and shame her for who she is, driving her (again) out of town.

At Cinderella’s chateau, her stepsisters and stepmother prepare for the ball, but there’s no sign of Cinderella. Good riddance. The three get ready for the ball (UNFAIR REPRISE).

But Cinderella doesn’t leave. Oh no. She’s not going to let these townspeople control her fate. She’d leave on her own terms, sure, but she won’t be swept under the rug. She won’t be disappeared. So she goes to Godmother’s, looking for some help slipping back into town (and slipping into the ball).

But things get out of hand (BEAUTY HAS A PRICE) and Cinderella is transformed. But wait! Cinderella can’t pay! So, in a ‘try before you buy’ situation, Godmother lets her leave, but tells her it’ll only hold until midnight. (And she must return the shoes the next day, or she’ll lose her deposit). Whatever. Good enough for Cinderella. She runs off to the ball.

ACT 2:

It’s the Prince’s ball (THE BALL) and everybody’s vying for Sebastian’s attention — especially the two stepsisters. Cinderella arrives, but — what’s this? — she has a British accent now (and can’t shake it); she looks so different and sounds so different that Sebastian doesn’t even know it’s her! Cinderella is dejected. As the clock strikes midnight, the stepsisters fight to get to Sebastian, finally planting kisses on him (simultaneously, one on each cheek). 

Cinderella’s disguise starts to slip away and she runs from the ball, losing a glass slipper (and her wig) as she goes. Her stepmother recognizes her and stops her at the door, but Cinderella shouts out “Leave me alone!” (In her own voice, which has returned because it’s after midnight now). As Cinderella exits, Sebastian, hearing her voice, calls out for her, but she’s not there. He finds only a shoe.

Cinderella, realizing that Sebastian is the only thing that ever mattered to her (I KNOW I HAVE A HEART BECAUSE YOU BROKE IT), packs up her belongings at the chateau, hell-bent on leaving town. But her steps arrive, so she hides in the fireplace.

Her stepmother and stepsisters celebrate (MOMENT OF TRIUMPH) and prepare for the double-wedding — yes, Sebastian is going to marry both of them. Cinderella sneezes, her stepmother pulls her from the fireplace, mocks her for her stupidity, tells her when she hears the church bells she’ll know it’s done, and then — in an act of supreme hubris — signs the crappy little chateau over to Cinderella, since they’ll be living in the royal palace now. Cinderella, dejected, begins to spray paint the walls of the chateau.

Cut to the royal wedding. At the cathedral, the ceremony begins (THE WEDDING MARCH), but Sebastian can’t bring himself to say “I do.” They start and re-start the vows in a comic bit where both of the sisters say I do, try to move his mouth to say I do, even have their stepmother say “I do” for him in a deep manly voice, but it doesn’t work. His mother shames him to be more like his brother, and — on cue — Prince Charming re-appears (MAN’S MAN REPRISE).

Charming instructs us all to marry for love (MARRY FOR LOVE) and introduces everyone to his boyfriend/fiance. They wed (THE WEDDING PARTY) and, as the two kiss and the church bells ring out, and the stepsisters and their mom slunk away.

Cinderella has created a masterpiece on the walls of the chateau. A ‘Bad Cinderella’ mural in spray paint and tears that is lovely and heartbreaking. She hears the church bells and (CINDERELLA’S SOLILOQUY) realizes that she’s lost the only person she ever loved. She hears a noise and hides in the fireplace again.

Prince Sebastian arrives. He admires her amazing mural. He finds the other shoe. He sings to it. Cinderella emerges from the fireplace (FINAL SCENE) and they kiss.

FINALE:

The stepsisters and stepmother try to slip back into Cinderella’s chateau but — uh oh — the locks have changed. They pound on the door shouting Cinderella’s name, but no one comes. Thunder cracks as it starts to rain and they run into the woods. There’s no place for them anymore in Belleville. 

Speaking of Belleville, the town in inexorably changed — by Prince Charming’s return, by Prince Sebastian’s love of art, and by Cinderella’s influence. Every wall is colored with art. Every person is dressed like an individual. There is no conformity, and no one wants it. The people of Belleville are, finally, happy. Because we’re all Bad Cinderella on the inside (BAD CINDERELLA REPRISE).

She said she would like to see a fairly easy to follow show since she doesn’t know much English, and knowing her, here are some of the shows I think she would enjoy:

Some shows that should give you an idea but are probably out of the budget:

- Six. I don’t know if it’s that easy to follow along with actually, but I felt like she might enjoy the poppy feel. Either way it’s a little bit way out of our budget.

- Moulin Rouge. I realized I was assuming my mom already knew what Moulin Rouge was, but apparently not so! So maybe I can show her the movie as well.

Some shows that might be in the budget??:

- Bob Fosse’s Dancin’

- MJ. I’m not entirely interested in seeing this but I feel like I can be convinced.

- And Juliet. This one seems like the most interesting to me, although I don’t know much about it. So if anyone can tell me more about this show I’d love to hear, thank you!

I’ve also told her about the option of buying rush tickets, although I’m not very experienced with that, so if there’s anything you think I should know about that it would be much appreciated as well.

So in April my mom and I are going to New York for the first time and are hoping to see two shows. The deal is that I pick one and she picks one, she almost immediately chose Funny Girl. I eventually landed on wanting to see little shop. My reasoning for this is that it’s a show that I’m very familiar with and something that just feels very broadway to me (yes I know it’s off broadway but you get the point) The problem is that mom doesn’t want to see little shop mainly because we have seen it in the past, this doesn’t bother me however since I was relatively little when we saw it and I can imagine seeing it in New York is very different experience. She told me to just think about it and that it may be worth seeing something new. 

Little Shop just feels like a safe option and something that I know I’d have good time at and positive experience. But if I were to choose a different show it’d be between Hadestown and Sweeney Todd. I’m basically not at all familiar with hadestown but I hear nothing but just insane praise for it. And I’m vaguely familiar with Sweeney Todd.

208,Would love some insight from those who have seen MJ,11pl0i0,"We live in the Midwest, and my daughter (HS Freshman) is in NYC with her HS chorus group. Last night they saw MJ - she was very excited to see a show on Broadway, but it wouldn't have been anywhere near her top choice. (For context, she's seen Hamilton x2 and DEH on tour, plus tons of regional shows, and of course, slime tutorials.)

At intermission, she texted me:

""OMG. My jaw was literally dropped the entire time. This is insane. Everyone is like freaking out cause its so good. The dancing and the lights and the set, it's so crazy omg.""

Then after the show:

""I can't even think a thought right now. I'm crying and my chest hurts that was absolutely insane.""

""That was singlehandedly the most amazing experience of my entire life. Like seriously. Every single person was like sobbing and like speechless at the end and omg.""

""Thriller was the best scene I've seen in anything in person or online, like anywhere. The act one finale was also amazing omg.""

She's normally a very calm and measured kid, she never texts like this, and I can't remember the last time I heard her this enthused about anything. Now, I know MJ won a bunch of Tonys so there's obviously something good going on, but overall, the reviews I've read have been mixed.

Can anyone who's seen MJ provide any insight as to what caused this group of Midwestern theater kids to absolutely lose their sh!t at MJ last night? :)

Update: They saw Wicked this afternoon. She really, really liked it, and said that Alyssa Fox was amazing as Elphaba, but it was nowhere near the kind of reaction she had for MJ. ",Dear_Air_4789,50,52,0.95
209,A biased review of The Secret Garden,11pkknu,"ThU SaY-cRuH’ GoH-‘eN at The Ahmanson (review) 

Disclaimer: I’m English, so that definitely affected my view of the performance. But perhaps this review will be relevant to you if you are English, watch English TV shows, or have ears. 

I saw The Secret Garden last night and I cannot overstate how atrocious it was.

I could write a book about it, it was so appalling, but I suppose I am definitely more sensitive to all its failures, being from England. But I think it’s inexcusable at this level of theatre to have accent work as shoddy as this show does. I’m not trying to be melodramatic, but it was actually offensively bad at parts, like when someone mocks the way you talk in school as a child.

I’m not a snob, and I know accents can be hard for people, which is why I was relieved (or expecting) to find that the accent work of much of the supporting cast was between passable and excellent. I can tolerate Tyrion in Game of Thrones just fine, the point is as long as it’s close enough, and has a clear and consistent identity, that’s enough to not think about it and enjoy the script for what it is.

But when the three main characters have accents so shoddy they wouldn’t be out of place on the most basic, unrehearsed am dram or school play, it couldn’t be more jarring in a city with one of the biggest acting pools on the planet, and a show asking premium ticket prices. For the same money, I’ve seen Hades Town, Rent, and the sublime The Band’s Visit, which makes watching literal middle school level performances all the more inexcusable.

I’m a very casual theatre fan so I’m not sure if it’s kosher to criticise the performances of children. But neither is it kosher to spend premium ticket prices to watch middle school level performances, so hey ho. For the record, I blame responsible adults for the following, and especially the director, who is ultimately responsible for the final state of the play. 

That being said, I really can’t overstate how fucking abominable the acting and accent work of the two main children are. In a show that is sensibly happy not to get hung up on realism, with race swapped characters and hunchbacks with no hunch, it makes zero artistic sense to force the children (or the actor playing Dickon) to perform accents it seems their brains are simply incapable of comprehending. With Mary and Colin, it’s like their understanding of an English accent is ‘say every single vowel and syllable like an alien, but a brand new alien every time’. There’s no excuse for any competent director to let a show play like this. My niece, aged 8, would do an English accent like this, and it’s the work of someone who literally doesn’t know any better, hasn’t had feedback before, and hasn’t ever practiced it. So it’s indefensible that people are paying money to hear the exact same thing. Nothing would have been lost if the children had just been allowed to perform in their regular accents, and in fact, everything would have been gained, because the audience would get to hear the majority of the dialogue in a manner that actually sounds human.

And not to let Dickon off lightly, because he’s an actual adult. His voice was majestic, to give him credit, but it’s not enough just to have a good voice. Once again, either permit him to just use his regular voice, or accept you have the wrong casting and keep looking. Out of all the adults, his accent work was the worst. At first I was convinced he was going for a semi passable Scottish accent, but that notion was rudely shattered when he switched to lurching between Mary Poppins and every region of an alternate universe England - but never (crucially) the real one.

I wish it ended there but the delivery of the two child actors is really abominable too. Again, all blame levelled at responsible adults here. Presumably they cannot showcase their acting skills when being forced to murder a dialogue they do not comprehend. But their delivery for every line ranged between flat, shouty, comical and demented. If that was a movie shoot, any semi competent director would be yelling ‘CUT!’ after each single line. So the fact it has been allowed to hit the stage in that state is truly unforgivable. There’s no end of talent in Los Angeles, so a performance like this really makes you think about nepotism in the creative industry, because how else are kids getting roles they absolutely are not qualified for outside of ‘can sing well’? (And to be brutally honest, that only applies to Mary. Colin was not a strong singer).

Sadly, that’s not the only downside to this production. The sets are artistic initially but incredibly barebones, supported tonally by staging and movement that is completely and utterly lifeless. Dickon’s character and his effervescent hopscotching ‘fiddle dee fiddle roo’ type character is entirely at odds with the production which is as dreary, bleak and hollow as it gets. He might have been a breath of fresh air in another production, but in this he is just firmly a part of the bizarro-world they have constructed, where serious characters and serious lines are delivered so poorly they become comical.

Perhaps this complaint comes from going into this show blind and expecting more of a musical than a sort of hybrid opera, but hardly any of the music grabbed me, even if the cast did have mostly excellent singing voices. The band was flat and sadly none of the musical moments really offered a reprieve from the painful delivery of the main characters.

Perhaps the staging and direction is secretly tonal genius, because arguably the biggest originating flaw is the actual musical is dull as dishwater. I’m not sure the original story holds up all that well to start, but it seems to have lost even more in translation. Nothing happens. There’s no stakes, no drama, and attempting to add any in a cartoon villain who is keeping Colin in bed, but that is never really explained and whose motives are only ever hinted at (and make zero sense) utterly fails to add intrigue to this absolute yawn of a play. Literally nothing happens, either staging wise, plot wise, or musically.

Sadly, it’s the worst theatrical experience I’ve had in many many years. Just glad I didn’t stump for the expensive seats.",LegaliseEmojis,6,0,0.5

211,A Review of Beetlejuice from someone who never saw it on Broadway,11pj1zu,"Hey Guys! Just saw the tour of Beetlejuice yesterday and wanted to share my opinions as a noob who only listened to the OCR and creeped on Reddit/YouTube videos. 

First of all, I was very nervous about Beetlejuice as we all know that Alex Brightman  is phenomenal and seeing other reviews on Justin Collette made me excited. I'm happy to report that he was phenomenal and does have a bit of the voice going on. My hubby had always gotten a bit of a Jack Black vibe from Alex which was not his thing, but made sense with School of Rock. However, he very quickly whispered to me (I know) that he was getting more Charlie Day energy which is way more his speed and enjoyed the show way more than he initially anticipated. 

Next, Isabella Esler is absolutely incredible as Lydia. She has a voice on her and I can't believe she's fresh out of high school. That girl is going to be a star. Hubby was a bit disappointed in the writing of Lydia saying she was too cheery and needed to be written with Wednesday Addams/Aubrey Plaza in mind. And I can see where he's coming from, but not sure it would fit the vibes of how they wanted the musical. 

Overall the rest of the cast was great, although not as spectacular as Leslie Kritzer, Rob McClure, and Kerry Butler which I think made the show drag a bit as I found myself only caring about Lydia & Beetlejuice. However, special shout-out to Britney Coleman who was great the best of those three parts and it's good to see her finding success (sucks YASSSSS!) after AVPM. 

Speaking of Britney/Barbara, there was a bit of a funny mishap with the book coming down and bouncing on her foot which she then kicked when she should be dead. This resulted in Beetlejuice double checking her pulse to make sure she was in fact dead. So with no hole in the stage, other mishaps can still happen! It was a great moment. 

Lastly I thought the sets and projections were great for someone who doesn't know any better. It was also good to see the sandworm!

Overall it was a great time and I would still encourage others to see the tour. Scaled back or not, it was still a good day of theatre with some good laughs.",Mrs-Drew,2,33,0.98
