0,Texas DPS sent my driver's license to an unauthorized party leading to my identity theft - should I pursue legal action?,11vpm17,"If you are not aware of this situation let me provide you with the cliff notes version... recently the Texas Department of Public Safety committed a blunder and sent my driver's license (along with 3,000 other Asian Texans) to a Chinese crime organization which has led to a series of events culminating in my identity being stolen. I first noticed fraudulent activity in my banking account 2 weeks ago which has led to me finding out that the identity thieves also applied for several credit cards under my name as well. I quickly realized that I became a victim of identity theft so I went through all the steps recommended to help protect myself including signing up for an identity protection service, calling all the financial institutions to disclose the fraudulent activity, freezing all my credit bureaus, and filing a police report (which I have still not heard from yet since filing 2 weeks ago). Texas DPS just sent me a letter in the mail admitting their mistake and upon further research they were aware of this situation since late 2022. Their lack of transparency and poor due diligence is infuriating. I'm frustrated because this should not have happened in the first place. Should I pursue legal action? If so, how should I go about this and what are the ramifications and expectations during the process?",Si3PO,27,451,0.96
1,[UPDATE] My neighbor’s dog is aggressive and has attacked my roommate’s dog three times now. What can we do?,11vq677,"Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/11tpbik/neighbors_dog_is_aggressive_and_has_attacked_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

After I reached out to property management, they contacted the neighbor and requested that the dog be removed from the premises immediately. Apparently mine is not the first report they’ve gotten. The neighbor sent me about 20 text messages about how his dog gets along great with other dogs, he’s spent so much money on her medical care, I was ruining his life, he fought for my country (he is a navy vet) and he didn’t appreciate me repaying him this way, now she has to be on the street because of me. He basically tried to guilt me into thinking this was all somehow my fault. I told him if he had an issue with the decision to have her removed that he needs to take it up with management and that I would not be discussing the issue further. I’ll continue to follow up with management in the coming days regarding the dog’s removal.

Hopefully he will either leave the property himself to stay with the dog or the dog will be re-homed to a more responsible and loving owner. 

Thank you all for your responses!",wareaglegirl5,1,147,0.96
2,Assaulted by a bouncer yesterday who was charged with assault,11v44tl,"6pm a group of 4 of us tried to enter a bar the bouncer let 3 in but stopped me and said, “you’re not allowed in. I know your kind”. I was like what does that mean? He kept repeating the same thing. I leaned my head in the front door to tell my coworkers I’m not allowed in. The bouncer pulled me by the shoulders and slammed me on the ground. Then a series of 5-10 hammer punches to the back of my head. I lost consciousness briefly when I came to I was bleeding from the back of my head, my jaw was in pain and had another abrasion on the side of my face. 911 was called and officers were on scene immediately. The bar gave them the footage and they charged the man with assault. What are my legal options? I found out the bouncer was not an employee of the bar rather a third party security company. I went to the ER this morning they confirmed I had a concussion and did a cat scan, no skull fracture. My head is still pounding doctor said that could last up to a week. Not sure if I will be able to work on Monday. Any advice? Thanks!!!",jeihkeih,86,2654,0.97
3,"Non-profit community pool in Northern Virginia, water bill 10x more then historical amount used",11vihmp,"I’m the president of a local non-profit community pool, and we received a bill that is 10x the amount then any historical bill we have ever received.  To make things worse, the water authority was contacting the wrong number and we never received the bills to our PO Box.  So now the water meter has been removed and we are being told that we have to pay the bill of $45k.  We asked if we could be given a break on this excessively large water bill, but was told it is capped at $5000 for a one time bill.

Not sure what the correct next steps are to somehow fight this but still get the meter installed so we can have water again.

EDIT: Legal advice request is, water authority is requesting we partially pay the bill to have a new meter install to look for leaks.  If we do that will it prevent/block us from contesting the bill?  I just don’t want to do anything that would put the non-profit in a bad spot.",n8yourgr8,35,239,0.96
4,"I was raped and groomed when I was 14, I’m 18 now. Can I still press charges?",11vqcv1,"Is it too late to press charges?
What happened was, I was 14. I was on a dating site when I shouldn’t have been, but I was there. I didn’t lie about my age, any guy I talked to I said I was 14. 

I started talking to this guy, he was 21 at the time. He’s an international student from bangladesh. He says “We can just be friends.” But that changed from friends to… “we can date but no sex.” To…
“You can’t tell anyone what we did.” 
I thought I was cool, I had a mature boyfriend. He had his own house, a car, lots of money… I thought it was okay. 

Then on his birthday, he bought us a big bottle of alcohol. I was still 14. He gave me the bottle and I started chugging, I didn’t know what to do or how to drink, I never had before. After that he put on some music and I passed out. When I woke up, I was naked… on the floor of his dorm, crying in a puddle of my own piss and vomit. I have no idea what happened that night, all I remember was being scared and confused and him telling me to be quiet.

The relationship continued for a year. Most of the sex was consensual, though i wasn’t legal enough to consent I am aware it is still illegal. There was a time when we had a fight and I started crying and he tried to make advances on me. I told him to stop he wouldn’t, he raped me for 10 minutes while I cried until it finally killed his mood and he stopped.


My mom eventually found out about the relationship and took me straight to the police. I gave my statement and they asked if I wanted to press charges. At the time, I said no. 

They spoke with him but that was it. “He claimed he had no idea how old I was” bull shit. “That he didn’t know it was wrong” bull shit. 

At the time I thought it would be scary, to go to court and go through all this. That it would be easier to put it behind me and forget about it. But I think about it a lot now, and see how he really fucked me up, got me addicted to drugs… changed the way I view relationships forever. And took away childhood. It angers me that he is still walking free in my city, no consequences. 

His father is wealthy. I want his family to disown him, know what he really is. It doesn’t seem fair and I wonder if it’s too late to get justice as I am 18 going to be 19 in a few months.",Patient_Growth,29,76,0.83
5,Utility tree workers ruined my property when I wasn't home,11vldpk,"Okay, so I want to report this properly because This was done without consent, warning and when I wasn't home. Any help is appreciated.

&#x200B;

Last week we had a storm and a couple of days after there was a utility vehicle parked on the road beside my property. They were looking up the hill and I thought they might be planning to reroute the utility line that crossed over my property into the woods to make for easy access. I waved and said hi to them, let them do their thing and was going to ask them what was up before they left, but they left without me seeing. No one stopped by, no one talked to me. 

The following day my daughter and I had to go out of town, we left around 6am and returned about 11pm. While we were gone, the utility tree workers entered my property and cut 3 old growth trees to the ground, they left a huge log and a huge mess. They even destroyed my undergrowth landscaping consisting of 7 lilacs ( cut to the ground,, about 10 honeysuckle bushes (also cut to the ground) and my rhododendron that they broke irreparably. I called our utility company here in central NY (NYSEG)  but was told to file a claim online. I was not given the web address and am not certain of the name of the tree service that was used.. 

Later that day another utility crew stopped by and I expressed my disapproval. The foreman told me my privacy garden should not have been destroyed and that the shrubbery should never have been cut. He was also surprised at how many trees they removed and what they left behind. The lines are still entangled in the trees that remain, but two of the trees taken didn't come near the lines and were hard wood (those logs were removed, the pine was left behind and only partially cut up). He said they wanted to remove the remaining trees as well, but also said I should file a claim. Notice was supposed to be given and he said the way this was done was obvious it was done without consent and without me being alerted. I've owned the property for over 10 years and requested that they trim the trees around the wires when I purchased. They come through every year and no upkeep was ever done. If the maintenance was done regularly, they would not have had to remove the trees as they were all healthy. How do I file a claim and what rights do I have as a landowner? Can I request that they replace those trees with ones that will not grow as high  and demand they replace the remainder of my garden that was destroyed? That area gave privacy and curb appeal, now it's an eye sore.

6,Drunk girl climbed on car and wouldn’t get off. Ended up falling and losing a tooth. Georgia,11vrkxn,"[Ga] 

St Patrick day celebrations are in full swing. Last night I was picking up my wife and her friends from the club (I don’t like crowds of drunk people so i elected to stay home.) My wife and friends was (obviously) drunk and playing loud party music in my car. I didn’t really care about that tbh. Some girls idk came over and began twerking on the front of my car. That’s fine I guess, I’m not going to run them over for twerking. One of the girls, then decides to CLIMB on top of my hood, puts her hands on my windshield and then starts shaking her ass. Again, I don’t know these women. First I yell at her to get off and she doesn’t listen. Then I used the windshield wipers to hit her hands off and make her get off. In response she just starts lifting her hands over the windshield wipers as they go. This is moment the question stems from.

I put my car in reverse and back up 3-4ft and stop hard. It doesn’t faze her at all. She’s still going. I do it again. She then decides it’s time to get down but as she’s getting down she slips off and knocks her head on the ground. (This is a historic city, so the ground in this area is made of BRICKS.) when she gets up she’s missing a tooth and theres a shit ton of blood in her mouth. Her friend helped her up and they said they were gonna sue me.",IfYouSeeMeSendNoodz,13,33,0.89
7,My estranged wife is pregnant by someone else. Should I expedite my divorce?,11vi7me,"Pregnant Wife



My wife and I have been separated for almost 18 months and we live less than 5 minutes away from each other. 6 months ago my dad died and about 2 weeks ago my wife told me she was pregnant. The baby isn't mines as we haven't had sex in the last 7 months. We have been raising a daughter together who is not mines biologically, but she has not known any other father. In our separation, my wife bought a house. She just lost her job a week ago.. I have a stable job still but her income has been cut in half. The benefits at my job and the fact that she is listed as a beneficiary to them would allow her to have the baby for little to no cost. We are trying to be amicable and have agreed that I will still be in my daughter's life as her father. I'm wondering if I should expedite my divorce with an infidelity clause because I don't want to be used just because she fell on hard times.. no pun intended. But I fear this may be perceived as an act of revenge. Am I overthinking things or should I take swift action? I am still in love with her and want to be there for my daughter.

Note: In our conversations she has not expressed a desire to look for job. I'm not sure of the fetus' father's intentions to stay in her life. We still exchange ""I love you"", but I know this doesn't mean being in love...

Edit: I need help understanding the legal ramifications of not expediting my divorce with my estranged wife due to the fact that she is pregnant with someone else's child. 

TLDR: Wife is pregnant with someone else's child has lost her job and is still on my insurance. I feel like I'm being used.",Informal-Doughnut-32,24,125,0.9
8,Can I sue for buying a flipped house with toilet not connected to any pipes?,11v7m6y,"I bought a house in September 2021 and a week ago, after water spilled out from the base of a toilet, found out the toilet was never connected to a pipe. The plumber said he had never seen anything like it, and whoever flipped the house never bothered hooking it up. He wouldn’t even put the toilet back in place because he did not want it to be used. Everything that was flushed went right into the dirt/foundation of my home (on a slab). The bathroom floor has to be torn up, maybe the hallway, to fix the issue. We were quoted $3,700 for what they can see, with the price increasing if they have to dig up further down the line to fix the issues/foundation issues. Can I sue the LLC I purchased the home from? I did not have a warranty, but did not purchase the home as is. I did have a full inspection. I purchased in New Jersey. It looks like I may be protected under the NJ consumer fraud act. How do I go about this? Contact my realtor, a lawyer? Thank you!",cutie-1234567891011,52,416,0.95
9,gym forged my signature,11vjyul," 

i have a contract with a gym in which i signed over 3 years ago, i had finally decided to cancel my membership and when looking at the contract it had the price of around $16 a fortnight, and i have realised that it has been costing me $32, when i asked them they had just said that wouldve been the weekly amount but he just put the wrong amount in but that we had signed another document with the agreed $32 a week. after looking at the contract thoroughly i see on the $32 per fortnightly contract that my signature has been forged as i do my signature in a very specific way and neither of the signatures on the contract match my sig. it also isnt my handwriting where it askes for my initials.

10,"I have lived in a rental house with two roommates for eight months. The city inspector just informed me the house is only zoned for two tenants, and now we are being kicked out in two weeks [MI]",11vswrn,"Title pretty much says it all. I feel like the floor has just been pulled out from under me. Yesterday, a city inspector came by for a ""routine"" inspection of the household. Upon finding out there were three people living here, he contacted the property management agency and owner of the property. We have been given two weeks to drop someone from the lease or totally move out. The property management company has offered us a different rental property at the same price (though it is much farther away from where our lives are).   


Here's the thing: all three of us were signed on the lease, and the property was marketed online as a FIVE bedroom property, for up to five tenants. This is clearly was a huge mistake on the part of the property management company and owner. Is there any legal recourse for us? It seems egregiously unfair that we should have to pay the price for someone else's failures.

13,Landlord hasn't cashed rent checks in 18+ months (PA),11uy2o8,"Asking for a non-Redditor friend.

Friend has paid rent on time each month, via personal check (at landlord's request) for the entirety of his tenancy - about 4-5 years total. In the first two years, there were a handful of times landlord wouldn't cash a few months' checks at a time. Friend would call, she would say she forgot, and then cash them. For reference, the checks are sent via USPS.

Now, for the past year and a half or more, landlord has not been cashing checks at all. He's reached out to the landlord and her daughter a few times. No response from landlord, daughter seems not to care. He's made sure to keep the pending amount available in his checking account, of course. Landlord is quite elderly, and he wonders whether her cognitive state my be causing this.

Is there any time limit the landlord has for cashing these checks? Is there any point at which the friend no longer owes rent the landlord is essentially refusing to collect? Is there anything more he should be doing other than continuing to contact the landlord and ensuring the pending amount is available in checking? This is in Pennsylvania, USA.

Edit: I do understand the bank may not cash checks after a certain period of time. I guess I'm wondering more about any legal time limit a landlord has to collect on rent, if that makes sense.",snarfdarb,70,601,0.98
14,Oregon. Got “secret admirer” texts. Found out they are from a leasing agent at my apartment complex.

15,Crazy lady keeps putting parking stickers on cars in our own lot,11vvf7y,"Hi legal people! I have the weirdest scenario going on, and I'm wondering what we can do about it once we've gathered all the evidence.

My fiance and I have lived in our apartment complex for nearly 3 years now. The complex is huge, so there's a couple of small lots for extra parking, plus everyone has a garage and a spot in front of their garage. My fiance and I have 3 vehicles since he has a work van, so we always have at least one parked in the small lot at the end of our building. This particular lot has two spots with ""Reserved for hikers"" (nothing about towing) signs, as there is a teeny tiny (0.5mi) trail behind our building. The trail is owned by a conservation group that has a number of trails in the area, including a massive preserve literally at the other end of our road - point being, no one uses this tiny trail except for the complex residents. For the most part everyone tries not to use the two hiking spots, but occasionally the lot gets full in the evening and people have to park in the two empty spots. Considering it's currently winter and there's snow everywhere, plus the trial is closed at night, this should not be an issue. I've seen the conservation's truck come by twice, ever.

So the issue begins back in the fall. My fiance was working a busy call shift, and he parked his van in the hiker spots from 8pm to midnight, then worked the full next day. At noon his company got a call saying that one of their vans was parked illegally on private property and would be towed. They of course called him to make sure he wasn't broken down somewhere, and we realized the caller was talking about the hiking spots in our own parking lot. I called our leasing office, who had no clue what we were talking about and confirmed that they a) don't monitor those parking spaces and b) would never tow a tenant's vehicle without first calling us directly. A few weeks later he was parked in the hiking spot again overnight, and when he left in the morning found a note on his van telling him not to park there. His company again got a call from the same lady, and the secretary tried to get more info out of her. This psycho lady refuses to give a name and says she doesn't live in the complex, she just visits a friend there. Time goes by, I get one note on my car and my fiance gets a note on his car, we throw them in the trash.

Then, two weeks ago, I had left my car parked in the hiking spots during a very snowy weekend and came out to find a bright green parking sticker on my windshield right in the middle of the driver's line of sight. It said I was parked in reserved area but the ""tow by"" section was blank. Getting it off was horrid, it took half an hour of scraping plus windex and rubbing alcohol. Last night my in laws were staying over, and when we went out to get dinner we noticed a neighbor was parked in the hiker spots and had a note hanging from the rearview mirror saying ""If you put another amazon parking sticker on my truck I'll sue you for harassment. You're on camera"" Genius. We come back from dinner, the only parking spot is the other hiking spot, so FIL parks there. This morning there's the same fucking sticker on their windshield in the same place. Takes just as long to remove. Now we're pissed and plotting revenge. The conservation is closed cuz it's Sunday and I'm 99% sure it's not them, but tomorrow I'll call them and our leasing office to cover our bases. My fiance is out buying a motion activated dashcam.

So, next time she puts a sticker on our cars and we catch her on camera, what can we do?

PS. If you search ""amazon parking stickers"" it's the amazon's choice green ones

&#x200B;

TLDR: Crazy lady with no authority keeps putting parking stickers on our cars for parking in ""reserved"" hiking spots in our own parking lot while the trail is closed. What legal recourse do we have? You can't just slap a sticker on someone's car because you don't like where they parked even though it's not your property, right??

16,My upstairs neighbor wants my apartment and is messing with my electricity,11v0yfo,"For context, I (25F) live with my (65F) mother in California in a studio apartment with an electrician upstairs neighbor who wants to have our apartment because it is insanely cheap. 

Things that have happened so far: 

A few months ago noisy neighbors moved into the unit above mine which cause me to complain to property management because I almost got into a car accident one morning due to the lack of sleep my noisy neighbors caused. Even with video evidence of the noise, property management didn’t do anything because the neighbors claimed their kids are making the noise and they can’t control them. 

Prior to this my entire kitchen cabinet came crashing down after they were dropping heavy items on their floor/ my kitchen ceiling. Again, nothing was done to the upstairs neighbors. They just fixed the cabinet and called it a day. 

The couple upstairs is very violent and they have kids in the apt. One day the violence got to the point that we had to call the cops. While we stayed anonymous, the neighbor said he knew it was us and that he had to talk his way out of getting arrested. This when everything went down hill. 

When we confronted him about the continuous loud noise he admitted to wanting our apartment because he said he figured out how much we pay in rent and that he has previously moved 4 times in our complex so he knows it won’t be a problem. He said the only solution he saw to end this situation was to have have my mother and I speak to the property management and ask to switch apartments with him so he can be on the ground floor. The property management said he had put in a request to move into a floor level unit but none were currently available (which is bullshit bc we’ve had two families move into two floor level apartments. 

This is where things get weird. After this interaction with him we started to hear scrapping and sawing in the middle of the night proceeded by the sound of metal into our walls from upstairs. Shortly after this we started to hear a loud buzzing noise come from our walls. It was the sound of electrical currents. We had an electrician come in and he said we had uneven voltage through the apartment and that the overload of electricity can start a fire if it overloads and there are crossed wires or corroded wires. along with the noise our air conditioning system would randomly turn on and off. Along with that our fridge started to over heat at times or not get enough energy and would turn off as well (this is critical because I am on medication that has to be refrigerated and I can’t afford to have it be spoiled for a faulty fridge. 

Along with the electric problems my mother and I noticed that whenever we would pull out our phones to record the loud banging it would stop and as soon as the phone was put away they would continue. I’d move from the kitchen area to the living room and the noise would follow. When we’d leave the apartment we’d come home to items being thrown at our front door like piss. So my mother and I decided to get a front door camera and one day a rock was thrown at our door and the camera was conveniently down but when I chased after the person in the stair well I saw my neighbor running up the stairs. (I know this sounds crazy and the thought of him having cameras in the home sound crazy but my mother and I had to vacate the apartment for a few days while there was a city inspection bc the studio is not approved as a studio but a gym turned into a storage space and the locks are flimsy so we think it is possible) 


We still deal with the loud electrical and high voltage everyday and now there has been what spectrum calls “a signal interference” which causes our security system to go offline. My mother said she is dealing with constant headaches and dizziness since we started to deal with the high voltage in our apartment. 

He is an unlicensed electrician with his own company and he has all the tools he would need to keep this going… 

We have gone to the cops two times now and they said this was an issue for the landlord and the property management but they don’t seem to care and either don’t respond to my emails/ texts or give me the run around.

The other day I received the will(s) from the lawyer.  The lawyer included an old will dated 5/2022 and the most recent will dated 11/2022.

We used to party when we were young and moved to suburbs when we got married hoping for a quite life so we didn't say nothing for almost 6-9 months but it got to a point where it was unbearable like EDM music going till 4 am and starting back up at 7 am so I finally went over and politely asked him to lower the music, he said no problem and did reduce it from ""knocking pictures of a wall"" to ""oontz oontz "" level. We tried to adjust to it as well but couldn't. 

After a month I went over and asked him to please lower the music as our entire house is still vibrating and we are unable sleep or even watch TV. His response was he already reduced enough and now feels like he is being restricted in his own home and said something about how dare I disturb him at his house at night and he slammed the door. 

It felt bad, I was polite and always stood at the bottom of the steps like more than 6 feet away from the door so he didn't feel like I'm in his face and respectfully asked him but yet he was arrogant and slammed the door. I didn't know what else to do, so we thought we will just inform HOA next time instead of talking to him directly. 

Since then he lowered his EDM music little more but still enough to make ""dun"" ""dun dun"" sound like ORC drums from LOTR which still vibrated our furniture a bit and could feel it even in our couch but as it was less often than before we didn't know if we wanna push our luck so didn't say nothing for 3 months, where he partied less and even if he did he only did till 10 pm (we still couldn't concentrate on TV with that background reverb till 10pm but adjusted). Now after 3 months he is partying again until 4 am and we are unable to sleep not sure what to do. 

Should we report to HOA? OR Should we write him a letter explaining our side and hoping he will understand? If so what to even write in that letter? I can thank him for lowering the music but we are still feeling a lot of reverb n vibrations in our house and we work most days and need restful sleep like anyone to function so can he please understand how his enjoyment is causing us to suffer? Maybe he thinks he lowered his volume but that might not be low enough to not bother neighbors as his setup of huge speakers, amp, sub might not be a best place in a residential community where we share walls?

Me n my wife don't want any conflict and didn't want to escalate, just want to resolve peacefully that's why we never called cops(there were many instances we could have). We really can't take this anymore after 1.5 years, so whatever you guys suggest is the best solution I will gladly take it except for moving as we can't afford to move from our first house yet. 

Thank you very much in advance.

23,Our landlords never put us on the lease (OR),11vwt9f,"Hey everyone! I'm in my first apartment right now and I'm not entirely sure what my rights are here. My partner and I took over a lease last June. It's a 2 bed, so we replaced one tenant and the remaining one stayed. We signed all the papers, they said we were on the lease.

Then, in January, our roommate (last remaining tenant on initial lease) moved out  and we learned that we were never signed onto the lease. They assured us they'd fix it, and that they would vouch for our residence history later (which is a concern for us as we are young and don't have a lot going for us as tenants). So when we went to sign our new roommate on, we asked for a printed copy of the rental agreement, to ensure that all of our names were on it. They gave us a 2 year old document from the very beginning of the lease - so ALL old tenants. None of those people live here anymore, and no current tenants are on it as the lease has since been fully turned over. We went BACK to the office to once again discover that NONE OF US ARE ON THE LEASE. 

Is this legal for them to do? Are there any protections for us, any promises we can get in writing? How can we assure that we get on before our 12 month term ends in June? Any help is greatly appreciated",Apprehensive-Ad-4364,2,3,1.0

30,Trespasser is cutting down trees on neighborhood land - what are my options?,11vbd8f,"Hi all, 

Executive summary: A farm hand (with a long and aggressive criminal record) on the farm adjacent to my subdivision is cutting down trees in a woods that is considered “community open space” for the neighborhood that backs to my property.  The person in question has a long criminal record and just recently got out of prison, so I’m worried confronting him will put me, and my family, at risk.  What are my options to make this stop?

The longer version: 

I live in a small subdivision in rural MD that sits adjacent to an approximate 40 acre farm.  It’s a deeded neighborhood with a HOA that is, essentially, inactive.  No leadership, dues collected, community maintenance, etc. The neighborhood includes several sections of “community open space” (ie: retention basin, and a large woods/creek area).  My property backs to the woods and is adjacent to the farm. 

Several years ago, the farm hand who resides on the farm (owner is elderly, so this guy maintains the property in exchange for squatting there) started driving into the community space behind my yard and “logging” the woods, cutting down trees, dragging them back to his property with his tractor, and selling the millings as “rough sawn hardwood” on Facebook marketplace.  This stopped before I had to take any action because he went to prison for unrelated crimes (burglary, sentenced to 18 years, served 2, out on probation for about 2-3 years now). 

Now, the logging has started again, he cut down a huge oak today that is very much on neighborhood property.  As this is happening right behind my house, it clearly bothers me more than most of the neighbors as he’s chopping down trees in what FEELS like my back yard, not to mention ruining part of the scenery we bought this house for in the first place. 

My problem is, I’m not really sure who to call or how to stop this. 

1. Given his violent criminal history (assault, armed robbery, domestic abuse) I am hesitant to confront him directly, painting a target on myself or my family.  After all, he lives “next door.” 

2. The land is not technically mine, it’s community open space owned by the neighborhood and HOA that doesn’t exist. 

It should be noted, the land doesn’t belong to him either! 

Our deeds state that the community open space may not be substantially altered (ie: trees removed). 

3. Without video/photos incriminating him - I can’t see a good way to prove it’s him (which would mean getting close enough to take photos, thereby opening myself up to confrontation). 

4. Even if I involve the police - I’m not sure what can really be done to remain anonymous and get this to stop.  Given the location, there are only about 3 neighbors who could see this happening, and I’m the most adjacent. 

5. Legally speaking, the HOA only exists on paper and has no money or leadership to fight a legal battle, so it’s very likely I’d need to foot the bills for a legal battle. This guy s doesn’t have two cents to rub together so I’m not sure suing him would have any effect. 

Ideally, this is criminal (trespassing, destruction of property) - I’d love to see him return to prison as we’d all feel safer for a couple of years. But since it isn’t my property being destroyed, technically I’m not sure how this would play out.  Is local law enforcement the best first call to make?",rwberinger86,5,33,0.88

I ended up coming out when I found out information that led me to believe he abused his own children as well. 

My brother and I went the authorities to report him, but unfortunately there is nothing they can do unless my niece or nephew come forward. They are not ready to do so.

36,Landlord trying to push for his,11vsd0r,"My landlord is really bad at adhering to his responsibilities and recently (past 2 months) I started delaying the rent payments so that he’d do at least a part of what he promised to have done and completed before I had even moved into the house (7 months ago). On the other hand, the contract I signed — the lease agreement — specifies that the rent payments are due the last day of the month each month (or that’s the way I and everyone I had consulted with interpret it at least). I well knew this the first month when I paid “upfront” but didn’t think it to be a big deal since it really didn’t matter to me to pay in the beginning or in the end of the month. Now I don’t want to continue doing that for multiple reasons. So, I told him that and that I won’t pay until the rent’s actual due date. He disagrees with my “interpretation” of the lease agreement. Last month was the first month I paid later and he annoyed me so much that I paid in the middle of the month rather than as I initially decided — in the end of the month. This month he started texting and reminding about “overdue” rent payment since the 2nd of March. He texted me on the 3rd again and then on the 17th I received a letter from him — 5 day notice to quit which states that from the date I receive it I have 5 days to quit (it’s dated for the 3rd of March). It’s now the 19th of March and I feel a bit worried but also very strange. I am rather certain that I contractually don’t violate any terms while he has been for a while — and keeps doing that. But this additional pressure on me that he tried to put with the letter is really frustrating me and I’d wanted to see if it’s possible that I am misinterpreting the contract. I’m attaching the part about the payments. Please let me know what you think and when is the monthly payment due the beginning or the end of the given month. 

“RENT AND SECURITY DEPOSIT AND PAYMENT THEREOF
3. For the initial term of this Lease, rent is set at $15,600 or one thousand three hundred ($1,300) dollars per month.
The security deposit for the Premises shall be one thousand three hundred ($1,300) dollars. Rent is payable monthly, via direct withdrawal from a bank account specified by Tenant, at the rate of one thousand three hundred ($1,300) dollars per month during the term of this agreement on the last day of each month. Tenant agrees to pay $1300 as payment of the security deposit upon execution of this agreement. Tenant agrees to pay $50 for each returned check. For each of the twelve months of the term of this Lease, payment of $1,300 shall be made via direct withdrawal from the bank account specified by Tenant, which withdrawal shall occur on the last day of each month.

LATE PENALTY
4. Time is of essence of this agreement as to payments by Tenant to Landlord. If the rent is not received before 6 PM
(EST) on the last day of each month, the rent will be considered late. A late fee of $50.00 per day shall be assessed until rent and late charges are paid in full. Any returned check will be considered as unpaid rent. A late fee of $10.00 per day shall be assessed until unpaid charges are paid in full. 

FAILURE TO PAY RENT
5. Tenant's failure to pay any installment of rent or late charge when due is default under this Lease. If Tenant does not pay any of the foregoing obligations within five (5) days after receipt of written notice to cure, Landlord may terminate this Lease and proceed to obtain possession in accordance with the law and seek damages as are appropriate under this Lease and the Virginia Residential Landlord & Tenant Act (the ""VRLTA"").”",NoTitle83,1,2,0.76

38,Need advice on how to proceed or just take my losses and move along….,11vs7vk,"My previous post was removed due to not providing enough detail so here it is!

Hired an Atty to represent me in my separation and divorce January 2019. Right from the start I said I wanted to file a separation agreement for our child and myself. I was advised there was no need to do that since we didn’t have a lot of assets. 

Fast forward, after waiting the year and a day my ex filed for divorce. Divorce was granted even though nothing had been settled or decided on in May 2020.  

Little back story, he walked out via a text message after almost 20 years, and moved in with my married “friend”. Came out and admitted 3 months later when they got engaged. They were married in June 2020.

So, I feel based on this alone there should have been an agreement to protect what there was knowing his character and how things have played out. 

The marital home was deeded in both names (state law) but I was the only one on the mortgage (neither here nor there). However, when you are married it protects the property from someone being able to place liens against it. When he filed and was granted the divorce that covering was then removed. I learned all this later which I’ll explain in a few. But still no separation agreement or ED completed. 

Fast forward to mediation for ED settlement June 2021 where my ex clearly stated he had no outstanding debt that he was aware of after being asked specifically about a certain loan/bank. Based on the information provided he was given the property that was attached to that loan that was solely in his name. He agreed that should any of this debt surface he would be responsible for it. All was settled and signed off on and I was awarded the marital home. 

Now I’m in Nov 2022 and having to refinance to completed some needed repairs on the home. We are 2 days away from closing when the closing Atty contacts me about a lien on my home for $22k which I had no idea existed since I did not owe any debt. Come to find out, it was this specific loan my ex was asked about at mediation and he said he was not aware of. 

I started my research and found out he was initially served at his residence in Nov 2019 to appear in court for the debt hearing. His now wife signed for it delivered by the Sheriff. So he lied about the debt and knowledge of it prior to signing the ED agreement. 

So, I had to pay off the debt in order to get the refi completed and I had no choice since it was work that had to be done! My Atty said my only recourse was to file a contempt of court to our agreement since he lied and we have proof of that. 

The end result in court was I was SOL solely because there was no time limit stipulated in the agreement for him having to pay the debt. The judge did not agree that he was in contempt due to this loophole. 

Questions are:
1. Do I have a case against my Atty for: a. Not filing a separation agreement
b. Not advising me to verify there were no liens on the property prior to ED
c. Negligently not adding in a time frame for debt to paid.

I feel these were a snowball effect that lead to me loosing the $20k. Especially since there is NO time frame for my ex to pay me the debt so I will never see it.",freedom1192019,0,2,0.76
39,Attorney Misconduct - Ghosted and Scammed by Attorneys in CA,11vs3g2,"Boyfriends Father died, with a will naming my boyfriend as his heir. Father was legally separated from his wife for 13 yrs at the time of death. Lived 9hrs from her. The legal separation reads very much like a divorce in that they have no legal rights to each others properties, debts, estates, wills, etc... it named 5 assets that she would get upon his death and that was it. Upon death she immediately began acting as the executor with no legal authority. She took over his accounts, his funerary arrangements, got into his email accounts, attempted to collect his mail from the post office & showed up at his home demanding his belongings claiming she was his legal wife and threatening legal action against anyone who contested that. She was calling my boyfriend asking him to produce belongings that were his fathers, stating they were hers... We consulted with an attorney at a large firm who was excited to handle the probate and litigation for civil, fraud and possible criminal charges against her. 

We sent the signed contract and retainer funds 10/2021. We heard nothing, i called several times and discovered the attorney we initially consulted with had left the company. They eventually assigned the case to another attorney in the office. It took 6 months for him to get the probate filed, no idea why. After they filed the probate, they unexpectedly referred us to another attorney at another company to handle the ""exploratory probate"" (since she took over and we were unaware of what assets were there, we only knew of a few) & any litigation, stating they didnt do that there. Apparently the attorney we originally consulted with did, but he was now gone. I wouldn't have signed/sent the retainer tp them had I known this had changed. 

We retained attorney # 2 in April 2022 to do an exploratory probate & look into possible civil/criminal suits. He told us several things he was going to look into regarding the probate - check case law on the funerary rights, look into a deed, subpoena all records from the legally separated wife who had taken over all accounts & estate matters illegally, possinly file fraud charges, etc... we had 6 months to turn it all into the probate court. 

He never did any of it, he kept putting us off, telling us how busy & overwhelmed he was, we offered to seek another attorney and he said no and pormised he would start to work on our case - this went on for months. I kept having to send him the same email at his request explaining the situations multiple times as he would never read it or respond, he eventually checked into 1 investment account we mentioned, out of the several things he was supposed to look into, the week of our court date when the asset info was due back to the courts, but it required further research/a handwriting expert as the document appears to have been forged.... he told us he looked into that one 1st because it was the most money and we could use that to pay for the rest (i realize now he was looking for a quick payout). When the deadline for the discovery of assets was upon us in September 2022, I sent a panicked email to him, to which he explained he would simply get an extension so he could conduct his research. He didnt do that, he missed the court date altogether!

On our last conversation 10/2022 he asked me to send the email with the possible case info & questions we had 1 last time, promised he would read and respond to the questions we had on each possible suit, and asked me to confirm I wanted him to proceed with the handwriting expert on the investment account. I sent him an email confirming to proceed in mid October 2022 and since then we have NEVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN. I sent 3 follow up emails over the next several months, copied to his paralegal each time. No response. We did receive a bill where he had several charges for consults with the original probate attorneys office over the months but i was unsure what he would need to consult with them about since he had all the same info they did and hadnt followed up on anything yet. 

In January 2022 we received a letter from the courts to appear and possibly face fines for not producing asset info on the probate back in Sept. Since attorney # 2 hadnt responded to me since Oct 2022, i panicked and reached out to the 1st probate attorney who referred us to him in Feb 2023. At this point, I thought something terrible may have happened to attorney # 2 since he wasnt responding. Attorney #1 reached out to Attorney #2 and #2 tells #1 that he was done with our case and he never found anything! I was blown away that he had not communicated this to us at any point simce our last conversation, I was shocked that he was alive but refused to respond to us at all, and that he had lied to Attorney #1 stating he didn't find anything - when he never did any of the work he promised aside from reaching out on the 1 investment account just the week before the Sept due date. Attorney #1 asked for a bulleted list of all the things #2 promised to look into but didn't so they could discuss. I sent that to him. I also told Attorney #1 that we no longer wanted to proceed with Attorney #2 due to his complete an utter lack of professionalism.

Attorney # 1 appeared at the new court date in Feb 2023. Prior he asked us not to say anything to the judge about why we had no info yet, unless the judge specifically asked my boyfriend. Instead he would just tell him they hadnt found anything but were still researching - i realized this was a nice way to cover their asses so they didnt get fined. Attorney #2 was also supposed to appear at this court date, but he did not. He instead reached out to attorney # 1 and asked for an update on how it went. The court granted an extension. 

Attorney #1 never gave us exact reasons for why Attorney #2 never handled our case or did the things he promised. He didn't seem bothered by the fact that the Attorney he had personally referred us to had not done anything and we still had no answers & no assets to report nearly a year after retaining Attorney #2. He told us attorney # 2 typically does good work for them. He simply told us we will have to find another attorney to handle the exploratory probate. Meanwhile we have just wasted money and time and with no empathy from him.

We have since received another billing from Attorney # 2, now billing us for the conversations he recently had with Attorney #1 where he said he was done with our case, after not responding to our repeated contact attempts since October 2022, i found the audacity almost comical! Attorney #1 should not havr had to track him down for us in the 1st place! 

Now we just received our 1st and only bill from Attorney #1 for over $17,000! Since our case was handed over to #2 we didnt know we had a bill in excess of the initial retainer because their contract says they will bill periodically, most likely monthly and never have since we ratined 10/2021, and because i requested a billing from them via email in Sept 2022 and never received any response or bill. I was beyond outraged to discover that they too were charging us for multiple consults with Attorney # 2 thru the year.  

At this point the court is expecting info on assets in the next few months. We no longer have an attorney to explore that for us. We are so lost and after being screwed by the ex, we got screwed by 2 different attorneys who could care less. We feel like we got sscammed. We have no more answers on what assets are there and what criminal and civil suits we can pursue than we dod when we started this process in 10/2021. We feel like we need an attorney to go after these attorneys. This just doesn't seem right. I was told to write the CA Bar. I tried to call and understand what that process entails or whether we should pay these bills in the meantime, but they don't give advice over the phone & told me to write in. Which I will, but how utterly exhausting, overwhelming and defeating this has all been. 

Sorry this is so long. Thank you if you got the end.... am I wrong to feel this is unusual/unprofessional? Any advice would be helpful.",LanaKing89,0,2,1.0
40,Rights on Removing Person's Belongings (in California),11vog1o,"Hi folks,

I'm coming out of what I now realize was a mentally abusive relationship. It's important I sever all ties with this person. She has been overseas for two years and has my garage filled with her belongings. I've emailed her that she has to move her items from my garage by the end of June - but she won't agree to a deadline. I'm leaning on pre-paying three months of a public storage unit and moving it there next week - then giving her the option of picking it up or just continuing renting the facility. I know she is very opposed to this idea.

She is incredibly vindictive and smart. I want to make sure I don't leave myself open to litigation. But every time I interact with her I'm exposing myself to more mental abuse. What are my options?  


Thanks.",fuzzninja2000,4,4,0.83
41,IP Infringement claim for an App,11vyi7x,"Hi,

I made an app as a hobby a couple of months ago and it gained traction. Now, after 3 months it's doing quite well.

I received an email from the creator of my biggest competitor today stating that my app was infringing on his intellectual property. Specifically he believes that the logo, design and concept are similar. He has (in kind words) threatened me with a lawsuit.

The concept and features which I believe are similar in both apps:

You post a selfie, you add your Snapchat username to your profile and your post is added to a grid of other posts (a feed). People can add your Snapchat from your profile. Premium features include being able to filter posts by gender and the ability to boost your post to the top of the feed for a certain amount of time.

There are other features which are unique to my app and his app that I've not included.

So my question is, can the above be considered intellectual property? Do I need to get a lawyer? Or is this just a bigger competitor trying to scare me?

The competitor is based in a different country than me and I'm not sure how to deal with this.

Logo issues:

My logo is a wink face with tongue sticking out inside a chat bubble with a different border style and colours than my competitor.

The competitors is a smiley face inside a solid colour chat bubble with a tongue sticking out.

Would this be considered an intellectual property infringement?

42,I have reason to suspect a debt collection law firm may be stealing money from me through excessive use of wage garnishment. (US - WI),11voeey,"First, let me say that I am way too relaxed when it comes to legal stuff. I knew I had a debt that I couldn't possibly pay because I don't make enough to pay it, and I knew whatever was going to happen was going to happen whether I interfered or not, so for the most part, I've ignored most legal paperwork filed against me. I know, it's unwise, and ill swallow that ineptitude on my part. Moving on...

A couple of months ago, I received a notice from a debt collector that the debt was being transferred to a law firm for garnishment on my paycheck. At the time, I knew I had debts, but I had no idea which debt it was that was being transferred. If it was a debt I actually owed, then so be it, I just wanted to know the source of the debt to verify that it was a debt I was aware of. So I reached out to the company mentioned in the paperwork I received in the mail...at least, I tried to reach out to them. Any time I would call, all I would get is voicemail. Every voicemail left went unanswered. The company's website was VERY shady in that nothing seemed to lead back to someone who would actually respond to me, and I had to actually do some digging to find the address of this law firm. Which, when I tried to visit in person, I couldn't access it unless I was an employee. So my paycheck was garnished for several months by a law firm that I could never get a hold of for a debt that I had no idea where it was from. 

That garnishment ended last month and this month I received a new notice of garnishment started by that same law firm. Looking at how my paycheck documented it, my paycheck itemized it as Garnishment A with an identifying number that has ended. Garnishment B with an identifying number is starting up. And those ID numbers listed are the same number. I could be mistaken, but if those numbers are the same, it seems as if this company realized it got away with garnishing me once, and now it's just repeating the process and doing it again on the same debt. Like they plan to keep on milking garnishments out of me until I notice.

After my attempts to get a hold of ANYONE at that law firm have failed and looked up the company on the BBB website tells me the law firm has an F rating, I'm really questioning whether this law firm is real or is it just a scam company using a legal process to steal money from me.

If you want to go after these guys on my behalf, go ahead. charge them whatever you'd like as your fee to get my money back if it is a scam. I just want this to stop.

Thank You",jrjocham,0,4,0.7
43,Security Deposit from renting,11vrvg9,"So I lived in an apartment for a little over 4 years with 0 issues on either end. No late or missed rent and no issues with landlord or neighbors. Signed a year long lease agreement each year. Recently, I made the choice to move out of the apartment and in with my fiance. So I spoke to the landlord and asked what I needed to do as I was breaking the lease early. She said I only needed a 30 written notice and would have to pay rent until someone else rented it. I moved out in January of this year, my lease ended in June. 

I moved out, had it cleaned all the normal things. I paid February rent and knew they were renovating the apartment so I'd planned on paying March rent as well. I emailed the landlord towards the end of February and asked how it was going with the renovations and if anyone had been on the list to rent it. To which I got back ""it's been rented. Thanks for checking."" So I almost paid a months rent since she never let me know it was rented. 

I just received a letter in the mail for the move out costs, which I owe $373 for according to her. This is where I'm looking for advice. My security deposit was $815 and when she said about breaking the lease ""you forfeit your security deposit."" I said ""I understand I get nothing back if there's any left over after paying for the repair costs."" And she agreed. So my security deposit obviously covered the costs and they still profit the difference. I emailed her again asking why I owe when the security deposit covered the costs. She simply said because I forfeited it when I moved out. So I looked at my lease agreement, which states nothing of forfeiting the deposit. It only states it's used for damages, paying rent or utilities in case of the tenant moving out or abandonment. 

Do I just suck it up and pay the $373 or do I fight it, refuse to pay or what's the best course of action I guess?",T-rev3,5,2,1.0

The only thing is, I get my learner's permit later this week and that means that I would have to wait nine months in order to get my full-fledged driver's license and be able to drive alone legally.

\- they are 16 years and 3 months old;

\- they have a form filled out by their parents; and

\- have held your permit for nine months.

I can fulfill all of these obligations except the last one. So hypothetically, what happens if a police officer catches me driving alone or with someone while having only a learner's permit? I read that it would lead to a 6 month driving suspension and some demerit points, which I am totally fine with.

61,Can I Take My Former Roommate To Court?,11vxia2,"Trigger warning: Mentions of sexual assualt and self harm

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

About a year ago a roommate I lived with in college sexually assualted me and harrassed me for months. He had claimed it was due to his mental illnesses but after talking to people with these mental illnesses they informed me that it had absolutely nothing to do with that and that he was only using it as an excuse for his actions. He never took his prescribed medicines for the issues he suffered with but instead would use drugs instead because he believed they worked better. When I confronted him about it he became incredibly defensive and aggresive about it. Dealing with him like this constantly forced me into a depression and I was unable to complete any of my courses or really take care of myself. Eventually I got the courage to speak out against him to our friends online as I wasn't able to communicate to them in person. He used that to his advantage and would delete my messages and make it so I couldn't communicate with them and would then tell them that I had sexually assualted him and for months went on to slander and harrass me. He even threatened to kill himself to put me in prison when I showed people proof. Since then I've had many issues with my health both physically and mentally and often have anxiety attacks due to all of this. I am also no longer able to receive aid to take my college classes because I previously failed them, and if I don't pay for this semester soon I will be forced to drop out. I cannot transfer to another school because of my current status academically and financially with the college either. I talked to the college and they said they would fix my ability to receive aid but that was the first week of the semester and now there's only about a month left of class and I don't believe they actually will. He has since admitted to it recently and gave me some money to ""make up"" for it (for anonymity its less than $500). He no longer attends the same college as me so there is nothing that can be done regarding that. Is there anything I can do? I don't have money or work and I don't want my family to know about this which is why I've held off but its come to a point where something needs to happen. I don't feel it's fair that he gets to walk away from this while I'm forced to deal with the issues it has caused me everyday.

64,Apartment complex adds unwanted amenities and increases rent,11vx7gi,"Hello, I would be grateful for any insight. My mother has lived in the same apartment building for 20 years. It is owned by a major rental company in our city, they own hundreds of properties, ranging from small, 4-family buildings to massive high rises. Naturally, over time there have been several rent hikes, but this last one feels particularly egregious. They went ahead and signed up for the services of a particularly awful telecom outfit, the kind that requires installing a big ol’ dish on the roof of her building. They wired up every apartment and added something like $80 to the monthly rent. 

The most concerning part is that they made it mandatory. As in, my mother is welcome to continue using her preferred provider, but she’ll just be paying for both. Now, I’m not an unreasonable person, and for the most part I try to pick my battles, but unfortunately switching to the new service won’t work. She needs reliable internet for work, and “reliable” just isn’t something that the roof-saucer people could claim with a straight face. 

I am not an attorney, and my understanding of tenancy laws is dismal.

A family member got a phone call this week from a debt collector regarding a medical debt from a hospital visit. The debt is supposedly under my name. The issue here is that I've never gone to the hospital. 

I called the debt collector and l asked for confirmation of who they are, what information they have of me, and who the creditor is.

69,Help! Living trust inheritance question.,11vwvhx,"I’m hoping someone on here can help me out. My grandpa passed away last November, and he had a living trust where he named his 3 children to inherit his assets. When my dad died he changed it so that my sister and I would split my dad’s share. My uncle is in charge as the executor of the living trust. It has been almost 5 months and none of us have received anything or been notified of anything until I demanded a copy of the trust a couple months ago mentioning lawyers and finally my sister and I were emailed a copy. When I reach out to him, he just tells me that he’s “working on it.” The trust states that all belongings, unless specified in a written form are to be sold and the money split between us. There is no written document stating that anything specifically goes to anyone, and I confirmed this with my uncle. This has not happened as my uncle has given away several items to the other beneficiaries and random other people. He donated several things as well, and has given my sister, my grandpas truck and travel trailer and my grandmothers heirloom wedding ring. He also sold my grandpas car months ago before he died and I don’t know where that money went. He has also kept expensive paintings that were my grandpas for himself. All of this, without discussing it with the rest of us. I have no idea what assets are available in any accounts that my grandpa may have had but I do know we are all supposed to split them and that my uncle is supposed to sell the house “as is” and we are supposed to agree on a sale price together and split the money as part of our inheritance as well. He has not listed the house yet and just keeps telling me he’s working on the house even though he is supposed to sell it as is. My sister doesn’t care to speak up as she was given the truck, camper and the wedding ring so she’s fine. She states that my grandpa wanted her to have these items and told her this by word of mouth. It has caused more of an issue between us because I don’t necessarily care that she has them if my grandpa really wanted her to have them. My issue is that it’s not written in the trust that she could have them, and it specifically states in the trust that if something isn’t written down, that the items are to be sold and split between us. I’m not sure why my other uncle hasn’t spoken up, we aren’t in contact. 

ETA: 6 months before my grandpa passed away my uncle called me out of nowhere, and offered to buy me out of my inheritance for a pretty lowball amount. He use the excuse that perhaps I needed it to use as a down payment on a house, and that my sister was really hard up for money and needed it. He said the only way that he could buy us out of our inheritance as if we both agreed since we share my dad’s share of it I declined and told him that I wanted the trust to be executed the way it was meant to be.

I’m just trying to figure out what my rights are as a beneficiary to help move this along. 

As well as what rights I may have in the fact that he is going against what the trust instructions are, and giving away items without permission from all of us. 

Also, wondering if I am allowed to have access to know what the balances are in any accounts that my grandpa may have had.

And lastly when I finally receive my inheritance from any accounts and the sale of the home do I have to pay taxes on the inheritance? (Living will is in California and I know live in Arizona).

70,[California] New landlord hasn’t dealt with gas issue,11vwqx6,"We are brand new tenants in this unit in Beverly Hills. We were charged from March 15th to the end of the month for a partial month in addition to paying our security deposit (1 month rent). We toured the apartment on the 13th, took possession of the keys on the 14th and gas was working. 

We went in on the 17th to clean and noted that the gas was cut off to the unit making the stove completely unusable. We advised at this time that the utilities had been disconnected and that SoCal Gas could only get in on the 27th to turn them back on. Meaning we paid for a unit that is not livable because our heat and gas for cooking is disconnected (per SoCal gas).

Our kitchen sink is also unusable because there is a missing hose and valve shut off while the dishwasher is being shipped in. That was originally supposed to occur on this past Friday, now it’s only on the 29th. This isn’t an issue, but the gas is 100% not acceptable in our view.

What are our rights in this situation?

71,Someone sprayed me and my car with gasoline while at a gas station - anything I can do?,11vwoib,"Hi all, 

Heres the situation. While on the way to a Costco gas station, my partner flipped a guy off who tried to cut us off. When we eventually got to the pumps, we started pumping gas and the guy rolled up, jumped out of his car and started yelling slurs at my partner and I. Guy gets increasingly agitated and grabs the gas nozzle out of our car, sprays me, and the inside of the car, before driving off after a costco employee pulls the guy away. 

Essentially, this guy sucked. No reason for the guy to do that when neither of us did anything that would have warranted that response. Is there anything I can do about this from a legal perspective? I'm in CA if it matters at all.",YourAverageThursday,2,0,0.5

73,"Former landlord trying to collect a ""debt"" from me after I was evicted",11vwjuq,"Sorry for the following long story: 

I rented a unit in an apartment complex for about 2 years, the last year I was there I didn't really renew my lease for another full year, but instead did a month-to-month renting situation where I paid an extra fee every month on top of normal rent amount to keep staying there (the reason for the month-to-month was due to job transitioning and I wasn't sure if I was going to be relocated in that time). My unit was the bottom floor (pretty much the basement area of the building) and the last six months I was there (roughly June 2019) I had a pretty major water leak. I called maintenance numerous times to get it fixed, they eventually did (but not really as you'll soon see) but I had a huge water bill tacked onto my August month rent (about $500 if I recall correctly). I figured this had something to do with the leak as my normal water bill was around $60-100 per month. I called the administration office and told them to fix my water bill as it was obviously incorrect. They said they would deduct from my following rent bills. Well, they technically did deduct some money from the bills but, I kid you not, they literally deducted PENNIES from the bill. So like 2 cents here, 6 cents there, and there was no significant reduction at all from my rent bills. I guess they thought they could deduct the least amount of money and carry this out for DECADES on end??? I have no clue but I was pretty ticked off. I obviously contacted the office again and they tried to play it down, continueed to NOT fix the problem. So by November I had HAD it with them (there had been various other problems with them that aren't relevant to the story so I won't include everything here) and I told the office manager I refuse to pay the next rent bill until they fix the refund/deduction problem and I wasn't going to continue to letting them just give me literal pennies back for the next 50 years to pay back what they owed me. The leak was NOT my fault, the buildings were somewhat old and outdated (built in early 1980's) and according to the maintenance guy, they needed serious updating. Come November 30th, I receive an eviction notice giving me until December 6th (2019 still)to get out. I had one week to find a new place and move all my stuff out, but managed to do it with the help of my boyfriend luckily and moved in with him. It sucked having such little time to do it but I was actually relieved to leave that place and all the stress it was causing me. I figured the deposit was theirs to keep since the carpets had to be torn up to air out the flooding the leak was causing (even though the leak wasn't my fault), and I had a cat that tore up a section of carpet around the bedroom door. If I remember correctly the deposit was around $900. Other than the carpeting, everything else seemed fine to me and I cleaned up as much as I could before I had to leave. 

Well jump to August of 2022 I receive a letter from a collection agency wanting $2000 on behalf of the apartment complex I dealt with back in 2019. This is the only letter or notice I've ever gotten regarding the issue, I've received nothing (no phone call, no email, no letter) from the apartment complex company directly. From the research I've done, I can apparently demand an itemized account of this $2000 they're saying I owe them, I assume in damages or whatever reason they are trying to pin it on. Again, nothing is detailed out in this collection of debt letter, just the amount I supposedly owe and where to send the money to. I've been sitting on it, not doing anything about it yet considering it didn't seem to have any legal backing behind it......yet.

Today I received a letter from an attorney's office with the same type of info as the debt collection agency letter, one page just stating the amount and where to send the money to. 

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to proceed from here, do I consult a real estate attorney? Can I dispute these charges of debt? Is this attorney's office pursuing legal /court action against me? Do I just pay the debt and chalk it up to a hard lesson learned? Any help is GREATLY appreciated! TIA",pinkcook4,0,1,1.0
74,Options for a minor (15) undergoing neglect,11vwjkc,"Hello all, apologies in advance if this seems foolish, I'm just looking for some info. I'm not going to go into the details that likely wouldn't affect anything, and stick to the main point. I'm close to an individual who is a minor (15) and is undergoing neglect. Nothing directly physically abusive, but just to a point where she could be seen unfit to be a mother. Some info that I believe could important are:

- She has many physical illnesses that make her unable to parent her children effectively
- The mother has history of weed usage (in NC, not legalized yet), and has used the drug while being the guardian of the minor
- The mother is verbally abusive, actively swearing, insulting, and degrading the minor.
- The mother has no stable income or job, and the only source of income she has comes from an ex boyfriend who is in no way legally obligated to provide that support. 
- The mother makes no effort to be responsible or take a caretaking role the minors, she does not make an effort to clean, cook, or otherwise take care of her children other than making purchases for food, clothes, etc. using the aforementioned source of income. 
- She is a single mother, with no other stable partner to assist in taking care of the child.

This is in the state of North Carolina, are there any options for the minor now or in the near future to get away from her mom? I'm not aware of the laws regarding this stuff and I want to ask you guys for some info before seeking out legitimate legal info from a lawyer or something.

75,Minefield of poo and cigarettes,11vpyff,"I am in Clackamas county, Oregon. The apartment community I live in has beautiful grounds and landscaping, with large grassy areas all around. They allow pets and have multiple dog stations with trash cans and poo bags. These stations are maintained (trash emptied and bags restocked) regularly, however some residents do not use these as they are required to do. They break the rules and they don't care, because they have no consequences. 

Complaints to the old manager went unheard. I'd call to let him know there was a big pile of poo near my front door, he would say ""I'll have the maintenance guy clean it up today"". After a few days calling and getting the same answer, I ended up picking up and throwing the poo away myself. 

Earlier this month, we received notice that the community has a new manager. When I first went to the office to explain the issue, she really acted like she cared, she even mentioned a small pile of poo in the flowerbed just by the leasing office that was bothering her. I told her some apartments do DNA testing or neighbor snitching programs, she seemed to think those were great suggestions. But nothing happened, and the poo piles were never picked up!

The second time I went to complain to her, she was too busy to pay attention, she just said, ""I'll have the maintenance guy clean it up tomorrow"". It's now been over a week since then, and these piles of poo have been sitting for even weeks longer, and the piles are only accumulating. My community is a MINEFIELD OF POO!

I am a dog owner and I pick up after my dog's poo, because that's what a responsible dog owner does. It's become more and more stressful to walk my dog in the community, because any time you step off a sidewalk here, you're at risk, ESPECIALLY when it's dark, as many lamp light posts in the community do not have working light bulbs and you can't see where you step.

I should also note that it's not JUST dog poo but cat poo as well, sometimes half buried. Lots of residents allow their cats to roam around and do as they please, without ever cleaning up the poo.

I've now emailed the property management company, which owns about 25 communities. I asked them to enforce the lease agreement and begin issuing fines to residents, since they could be making a lot of money off this. I just want to poo picked up. Is there anything else I can do? I feel like the manager is being negligent at this point. I haven't received a response to my email yet, and I doubt I will anytime soon.

We are a non-smoking community and I also notice cigarette butts from time to time, but this morning I saw 5 in a small area of grass while on my morning walk. Another thing I have to look out for while walking in the minefield. Is there anything else I can do? Who can I hold accountable for this?

78,Am I entitled to pay while on call?,11vprkh,"I work for a large specialty veterinary hospital in Illinois as a veterinary technician. Surgery, internal medicine, and neurology technicians are required to be on call for anesthetic procedures. In my department specifically we are on call one work day per week and alternating weekends and holidays (usually 1-2 full weekends per month).

If we get a call to come in (no matter the time) we are to be at work within an hour. We are not able to drink alcohol obviously and we can't travel more than an hour's distance from work while on call. Procedures we get called in for can vary greatly on length and complexity, but average time spent at work once called in is probably 4-5 hours. They are now trying to add another service that can take up to 12 hours after being called in and employees are giving a lot of push back. 

Sometimes you will get called in for 3 calls in a night. Sometimes you won't get called in for weeks. It's very variable. All of these procedures are some sort of emergency or ""urgent"" otherwise they would wait until normal business hours.


We get an on call bonus of $125-150 (depending on department/specialty) for each ""call"" plus our hourly wage. We are not compensated for the time spent on call when we arent called in. 

I have been searching everywhere to see if we have any legal grounds to ask for pay while on call (not just when called in), but it is hard for me to find any black and white rules online for my state. Most resources I've found have said something like ""if it prevents you from having your normal life you should be compensated"" I feel it does prevent that. I commonly have to leave my children's activities, have to stay super close to home as I already live 50 min away, etc. However I don't know if legally it would be seen that way.

79,Phone repair company ruined phone. Is small claims court worth it?,11vw7mz,"We brought my wife's iPhone 13 mini into a repair shop for a screen replacement. The screen has had a small chip in the screen since late last summer. Aside from this crack/chip, everything has worked fine.

I brought the phone in and was really steered towards a 3rd party haddware replacement. Once they replaced the screen, the screen was so dark that it was almost unusable. Think of the darkest your screen can get - that was now the maximum brightness. More importantly, the camera no longer worked and the phone kept crashing. I spoke with them and they agreed to put the old screen back in and try to fix the issues.

Now that they've put the original screen back in, the phone is still crashing repeatedly, and the camera still doesn't work. I called them today and they refused to even entertain the idea that they caused these problems and that they're happening because it was dropped. I told them that the phone has worked fine for 8 months, and we have documentation of when it was dropped (a social media post) and proof that the camera had been working fine until they opened it up (the gallery). They're refusing to acknowledge that they caused these problems.

86,Suing HVAC contractor in Georgia State Court,11vm50j,"In 2015 I had a new AC system installed by a longstanding small business, ""W"". In 2019, the system failed; after a short series of breakdowns where they couldn't find the problem, I called in another contractor, ""S"". Originally W had said the condenser must just be a lemon, and they would replace it under warranty, but I'd have to pay a significant amount for labor. S couldn't find why the condenser was failing either, and ultimately made the same assumption. I hired him to replace it, and a few days later it failed again. This time S spent more time investigating the system under the house, and he found that the coil had been installed by people who didn't know what they were doing. 

On the day of the installation, two guys in their 20s arrived and went to the crawlspace to do what I was told would take less than 30 minutes. They were down there a couple of hours before an older guy showed up at the front door and said they'd called for him. He was down there another hour or so before he came out, and he headed straight for the front door, barely pausing to say that it wouldn't be much longer. What I later learned...the coil comes in its own metal box, and the basic installation is to remove the old box and insert the new one. Some installers will shave a few *minutes* off what usually takes around 30 by opening the box and sliding the old coil out and putting the new one inside. These guys did the latter--I suspect they hadn't been TAUGHT the former; the problem was, the new coil was designed to fit in a box that was 4 inches longer than the old one! So those fools had been down there CRUSHING the coil to fit into the old box. The insulation at the back of the case had been torn down, the coil fins were crushed and bent, the doors of the case were warped in front to cover the projecting components, and the front frame of the case itself was separated from the case and they had used metallic tape to cover the gap. As badly as it was done, in the shadows of the crawlspace it was hard to see until you were very close. 

W refused to take responsibility, so I sued them in Magistrate's Court. The pandemic intervened before the case finally came to trial in December 2022. There, W said, essentially, they had used an industrial grade metal tape from Amazon to cover the case's gap (they hadn't completely) and that the system was functional as they installed it. I lost the case because the judge said I need an expert witness, and I would need to appeal. My faith in the ""greatest justice system in the world"" has crumbled, and I have serious concerns about that judge: A) Why would he think that I would have paid thousands of dollars for a ""new"" piece of equipment that had been mangled? And B) Does he not know that there are no damages to be claimed in this case which would pay for an attorney to manage the intricacies of a higher court?!  I'm very disgusted with the court system and the cavernous gaps in logic in the way it is administered. But I have appealed to State Court and am working to prepare a full case myself. 

My first question has to do with Admissible Evidence. I plan to ask the manufacturer to weigh in on the condition of the coils and what a proper installation looks like; *what should I ask for to make it admissible?* That is, do I have to arrange a deposition in another state? Can they simply provide a notarized letter?

Second, *how do I arrange depositions?* Do I just look up court reporters in the area, and how are fees set? I'm trusting that I can get these reimbursed as part of the court fees since the magistrate asked for it.

Third, I am seriously considering asking for a jury trial. *How do I go about requesting a jury?* I know it seems ridiculous to ask for 12 people to take time to sit in on this type of case, but my faith in judges is now abysmally low. Then of course, my next concerns would be questions for jury selection; in my mind I keep coming to one about whether they'd (be dumb enough to) consider paying thousands of full-price dollars for something ""new"" that had been badly damaged, and I can't get past it.",opendoor7777,9,2,0.67
87,Neighbors septic pipe in yard while building fence,11vvoto,"We bought our house in a rural area of Georgia mid-2019.




We just got a survey done a month ago since we'd like to fence in our property. (1 acre +). Last survey was done in 1980, our houses were built later in 1988.




After the survey we found that the neighboring property has what looks like a septic pipe about 5-10 feet within our property. 




The neighboring property is a vacant house and has been vacant since we moved in.




We're still planning on putting field fencing and tposts along our property lines, regardless of the pipe. This seems like path of least resistance and will stake our claim of land properly.




We'd rather not pursue any legal action against the neighbor since nobody lives there and we'd have to pay a lawyer to track them down. We just want to have the field fencing as a physical boundary of our property lines to prevent any possible encroachment issues in the future.




We figure the neighbor will have to deal with this when/if they ever decide to sell.




Is their anything we are not considering?

88,Employer Told Me to get FMLA Documentation Instead of Just Letting Me Go Back to Work After Short Hospital Stay,11vvmus,"I was in a crisis stabilization hospital for a week, and when I got out, I’d received an email from HR stating I had until March 2nd to complete FMLA documentation to excuse me from work. They said I would also need a doctors note before I could return to work from FMLA leave. The earliest appointment I could get with a psychiatrist was 3 weeks after I was discharged from the hospital, and I wasn’t working since I hadn’t been cleared to go back. My psychiatrist completed my FMLA documentation, but when I turned it in, HR said it excused my absences for the dates I was in the hospital, but not the 3 weeks I spent waiting for my appointment. My psychiatrist won’t say I was incapacitated for those 3 weeks since I could have worked, but only didn’t because HR required a doctors note. So now they are going to terminate me because I have 3 weeks of unexcused absences. 

The worst part of this is, I never wanted to take FMLA leave in the first place. I had a doctors note from the hospital and enough paid sick leave to cover that week. But my manager took me off the schedule for the following week and I got the email from HR so I assumed that I had to take FMLA leave. After rereading the email, I can’t tell if they were saying I HAD to take FMLA leave, there just wasn’t another option so I assumed I had to take it. The email just explained FMLA, said I was eligible for it, and said, “This form [FMLA certification] will need to be completed by your health care professional and returned to me within 15 days.  Please have the certification form faxed back to me by March 2nd.”

Based on the quote above, did I have the option to just use sick leave and not deal with FMLA? Can an employer require you to take FMLA after being out only a week? Do I have any recourse once they terminate me? My company has a (undocumented) history of discrimination against people with mental illness, and I suspect that’s playing a role here.

Led and strategized by me."" And using mine to help him write stuff, and vice versa. He also wants to add things to mine so that it lines up better with his own,  saying it's fine because he ""won't add things I object to."" Or things I don't remember, and if he did we should talk about it to see it jogs my memory at all. So, I guess what's the deal here?

My girlfriend (who is in the Coast Guard reserves) moved in yesterday and the apartment was nothing like the pictures online. There was a mentally unstable guy in the lobby singing, kids screaming and running around the halls, the elevator was barely in working condition, shoes laid outside of everyone's apartment, and the whole building (including our apartment) smelled of curry. I understand it was a stupid mistake for us to sign a lease without going up there to look at the place, but I needed someplace to live when I moved.

My girlfriend broke down crying when she got in the apartment because this is nothing we imagined and when I looked there was lots of reviews complaining about similar things that she experienced. I looked up laws that might help us break the lease so we can get out of this situation and I saw the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment in Massachusetts stated a few things that violate this law is, ""Excessive noise from other tenants under the landlord’s control."" and ""Emotional distress."" 

Is it possible that if we file enough noise complaints and nothing is done that we have a case to get us out of our lease?

I’m curious who’s responsible for the house report if there’s anything serious or hazardous. Should she be notified if there’s anything hazardous regardless? Considering this isn’t exactly a buyer and seller transactional thing I’m a little confused on it.

100,A few basic questions regarding LLC's tax status and real estate licensing,11voa10,"1) What Conditions enable AND/OR require an LLC to change its filing status (multi/partner/disregarded) for federal and state of California Tax purposes.  How often must it do so?

2 ) Under what conditions does a ""single member LLC"", lose its liability protections?  aka is the best of both worlds possible with liability vs control or do the two go hand in hand? As in; Can you only get liability protection with filing separate, meetings, minutes, independent attorney and accountant, etc?

3) Can an LLC represent itself for Real Estate? like how a manager can't represent a corporation??  It appears the real estsaste law says no, but there are some exemptions and I was wondering how hard it is to qualify for that as an individual with 8 properties and my wife the only other member of the LLC.

4) I was reading that an owner, or partner of, an LLC has to hire a real estate broker to manage rental properties.  Is that right?  Whats the simplest solituon to that that keeps liability at bay? Is there a way around that? 

5) What would happen to lease or property if a tenant found out a real estate license is void or the owner never had one but the owner of record was a corp or LLC?",1pnp_hippy,1,2,0.76

102,Liability exposure at a swinger's club (USA),11vu8qm,"**Part A**

With the owners' permission but independently 

I want to hand out brochures to the nearest public health center, where they have free STI/STD tests. I would do this on the property of the club.

And in addition, to promote awareness, if a member would show me they’ve had been tested recently, I would give them a wrist band. My hope is that this wrist band will cause others to ask about it and spread would of mouth.

My concern is what if someone interprets someone wearing the wrist band as “STD free” and then contracts something. Or if someone was able to deceive me with proof of their test and received a wrist band and then deceived others with it. 

Would I be liable for any of this?

**Part B**: Here's some information from Membership Terms and Conditions for a specific club I'm targeting that might be relevant.

\>If XXX club must employ an attorney to defend the owners because of an alleged violation by a Member of XXX club and or any person associated with the club, the Member agrees to **hold harmless** the owners, the owners of the real estate occupied and **all persons associated** (employees, vendors, website hosts, website designers, etc) with the club.<

But I'm not a Member, employee, etc. On the other hand, I will obtain and have permission from the owners.

Here's more Membership Terms and Conditions from same club: 

\> WAIVER AND RELEASE: You as a Member release all liability regarding club owners, the real estate owners of the property, all Members of the club, all staff and volunteers at the club, and any and all groups and individuals associated. All Members agree that if you engage in any physical activity, you do so at your own risk.<

So would this apply to me?

**Part C:** What if the owners' have me sign a release that says I have nothing to do with the club? Or something like that?

**Part D:** What if I do this (hand out brochures and hand out wrist bands if shown a recent test) at different clubs but don't know if there's member agreements to release liability, like the one club in part B? Does that change things?

Another company came to the house last week and stated that they would be able to fix, re-drywall the ceiling (it’ll take 2.5 4’ x 8’ slabs plus mud, texture, and paint) by the end of this week (3/13 - 3/17).

I’ve paid my rent every month for the past 12 months and as of 3/25, my new year lease begins. I want to light the flame and tell my landlord that I won’t pay rent until the ceiling is fixed. Do I have legal authority to do so?

106,Real Estate Portfolio / Risk Managment - Thoughts on this?,11vtqkc,"  
Brainstorming a way to reduce risk on a Real Estate Portfolio..   


I am the sole owner of *Company 1 LLC* that owns a portfolio of residential real estate. All of the properties that are owned by *Company 1 LLC* are free and clear of any debt. I personally did a shareholder loan to *Company1 LLC* to acquire the real estate. I have been taking a distribution to pay myself back. But the company still has a lot of equity.  


That said, Id like to reduce my risk in this company by pulling majority of equity out of all of the properties with a portfolio loan / mortgage of some sort.  


I was thinking about starting a 2nd LLC that I would also be the sole owner of... *Lending Company LLC*

  
*Lending Company LLC* would create a mortgage and do a portfolio loan to *Company 1 LLC* for say 90% of the value of all the properties. Then *Company 1 LLC* would use that money to repay my personal shareholder loan that I loaned to *Company 1 LLC* to buy the properties. This would also wipe out all of the equity in these properties.  


Moving Forward: *Company 1 LLC* would pay *Lending Company LLC* a monthly mortgage payment ( with a small interest rate ) moving forward. Just like a traditional bank loan. Rather than repaying my shareholder loan directly to me.  


The idea is that If any of the properties in *Company 1 LLC* ever gets sued, It would show that all of the properties in *Company 1 LLC* have a mortgage on them and that they barely have any equity in them. Therefor my shareholder loan would not be at risk and any persona who sued would not see much meat on the bone and they would have to tangle with Insurance for anything.

We do not get along well, but decently enough for our daughters sake. When she was born, I hyphenated his and my last name for her. I regretted this but, hindsight is 20/20. He’s never been a big part of her life except for his scheduled visitation, he’s never asked for more, doesn’t call on her birthdays when shes with me, just does the bare minimum. Gets upset that he has limited time with her but doesn’t go through the system to do anything about it or even attempt to talk to me about more time, just likes to complain without follow through. We went through an argument a few years ago and I filed for sole legal custody. Went to court. We had a date for the hearing and HE DIDNT SHOW UP. Just didn’t come, didn’t try to fight it. So I was given full legal custody and full physical custody with exception of visitation. My husband and I have been married 8 amazing years, and it’s so wonderful to see how close her and my husband have gotten. I’ve never pushed the “call him dad”, he read vows to her at our wedding that he’ll be there for her whenever she wants, and even in her hormonal teen years she loves watching “monster” movies with him.

She recently asked me about changing her last name to hyphenate my husbands last name to her dads last name. We talked about her changing her last name altogether, but she doesn’t want to upset her dad.

111,Need advice on what to do when an international small business won’t give a refund,11vn7oq,"Tl;dr, I’m from CA, USA and I’m wondering if small businesses are allowed to decline your request for a refund if they sent a faulty product? Is there a way to report a small business for not giving a refund? If so, would that cost money/would I need a lawyer? Or, am I just SOL?

In December 2022, I ordered custom shirts from an international (Chile, South America) small business (found on instagram), and when I received the products, the quality just wasn’t there; there were a lot of mistakes on the embroidery so the work looked messy. I sent them photos and asked how we could rectify the problem. They apologized for the mistakes and offered context about what happened and then said they “can’t give me a refund because financially they’re pretty bad off,” so they offered to send me other smaller products to compensate. I suggested that, if anything, I could get a partial refund just for the shipping (since international shipping was $35 (total cost: ~$85)), and they said they “don’t have the money at the moment so if I could wait a little longer [for them to send the money to me];” granted, they did say they “would give the refund if they could.” That was in late January 2023. Now it’s mid-March 2023 and, despite me reaching out to them twice a month for an update, they still haven’t responded, yet instagram shows me the read receipts that they’ve seen my messages. I totally understand that this can be stressful on their end trying to sustain themselves, but I also feel like it’s unfair that they’re not taking responsibility for customer dissatisfaction (especially when I’ve been understanding and patient with their situation). I just feel really frustrated that, if anything, I haven’t received an update on whether we can resolve this situation, because I’d really like to move forward and get my money back, even just a portion of it. I was wondering, if this lack of communication on their end continues, if it’s possible to report it somewhere/take action so I can get my money back? But, if I reported it somewhere, would it cost money to move forward, like if I need a lawyer or something? Because if I happen to need one + need to pay for one, then I feel like I should just accept that I’m SOL.

If it helps to know, their instagram doesn’t mention anything about a refund policy; I searched up that one of the only things that protects a small business from not giving a refund is if they state a specific no refund policy/etc? I also still have the faulty products unworn/unwashed; I’d send them back but that’d be additional shipping I don’t want to pay for, if they’re implying they can’t afford to pay for a return label, too.

115,Can an employer fire you for a fender bender had outside of work hours?,11vsve7,"Throwaway.

My spouse works for a mid-size company that spans several states. She is well-liked and successful in her career, and would be difficult for this company to replace. Her role is managerial, not sales or delivery-based, but all employee contracts seem to have been painted with the same brush. 

Her contract contains a stipulation that **the company must be included in our personal vehicle insurance as an “interested party.”** She must also report any moving violations or collisions to her boss (regardless of when/where they occur) within 24 hours, and then also submit for a drug test immediately following. **Failure to report**, later discovered by insurance claim, **is a firable offense**. The contract also states that **any two moving violations or collisions within a three year period** may also result in termination. Without any kind of comment on who the liable party is!

No driving is required on the clock for her role, although she does receive a monthly gas card allowance as part of her compensation package.

Now I thought this sounded like Big Brother Bullshit from the jump and made some stink about it in private, but she is very much a “keep your head down, work hard, don’t make waves” kind of woman who also suffers from moderate anxiety. 2.5 years ago, during her daily 1-hr commute, she caught a speeding ticket for going 4mph over the limit. This was no big deal - we went to court and had it dismissed so it wouldn’t ding our insurance - but she had a great deal of shame and anxiety about having to go to her boss and say “hey boss, I got a speeding ticket this morning.”

Sure enough, this past week she got into a minor fender bender. No damage to her vehicle, with just a little bumper ding on the vehicle she hit. Convinced that she would lose her job if she reported her second incident in three years (as I said, anxiety), she offered to settle in cash with the other driver. 

A few days have passed and the other driver has sent an invoice for the bodywork, but now my wife is beginning to panic that this will be reported to her workplace somehow, possibly by the other party filing an insurance claim anyway, and that she will be fired for failure to report and/or for exceeding her allowed violations. I have been assuring her that this will not happen, that that would be far too inconvenient for her company and also relies on a series of unlikely events occurring, but… anxiety.

I’m now just more upset than ever that this dumbass work policy is invading our home life and causing my wife so much stress. Is this even legal?

117,Getting out of a joint tenancy agreement?,11vsuca,"I have made a terrible mistake signing a tenancy agreement (TA) and want out.


So this started with me joining my four ""friends"" to start renting together all was well until after signing the tenancy agreement and discussions of room allocation were made. For context, they did not want to discuss rooms until nearing the start date of the tenancy and after signing the TA which I foolishly agreed to. 

When we did discuss the rooms over facetime person a was agreeing to take the small room and I would take 1 of the two en-suites it was agreed on until the next day when person a said they would not want the smallest for various reasons. Person b then says I need to take the smallest because I earn the least and it just would be better. Then it became person b pressuring and cornering me into taking the smallest room and how the three already agreed to me taking the smallest room without my knowledge and then saying examples of how they are more deserving of a bigger room. Later person b then stated if I am not satisfied with this I would have to look elsewhere. 

Later they all apologised and said it was a misunderstanding and that we can agree to what rooms properly after a day or so but then on the day of the tenancy the three agreed to what rooms everyone gets behind my back and I was upset because they decided for me that I get the smallest (again) but person b and person c agreed that rent would be 475 and person a would agree; since they weren't there. 

When we all spoke again they stated they could not afford the extra payment for the rooms I stated that I could and then they stated that it's more than just the rooms and I reminded them that I was not involved in this agreement to the smallest room. The conversation eventually led to the rent having to be 525 and if I wanted it to be 500 then I would have to let the two people using the ensuite use the one bathroom because it has a bathtub meant for the two people who would not have an ensuite. 

I just want to know do I have any rights of exiting from this agreement since I feel as if I would be vulnerable living with these people since now they're essentially demanding more money for things I did not agree to and I have a feeling they will increase rent depending on how they feel. I spoke to the estate agent about exiting the TA but she said if I speak to the landlord they may agree. 

On a side note, I've already paid the deposit and one month's rent equal amounts to everyone because rooms weren't decided yet.

P.s please don't remind me of how silly I was to sign this TA without discussing this beforehand and I should have been more careful but I was so desperate to leave my current housing situation due to some serious reasons, that they were aware of.",Odd_Astronaut_7512,5,0,0.5

Each time, I politely remind him that he needs to update the address where his business is registered. He says he will, but when I press him for a deadline, he gets angry and insists he'll take care of it. I just searched the New Jersey corporation registry, and his business is still registered at my address as of right now.

I am really not looking to have a confrontation with my ex if I don't have to - though we are on civil terms, we are not friendly and only communicate when necessary. So I guess I'm wondering a few things here:

1. Are there any potential consequences **for me** if he keeps the business registered at my home? 

2. If so, is there a way I can compel him to update the address? I'm not looking to be petty or vindictive, so preferably not the ""nuclear option"" - but I know from experience that he will not do this unless he absolutely has to. 

(To illustrate what I am dealing with here: Ex left a lot of his stuff at the house when he moved out. I spent 8 months asking him to come get it, and he kept insisting he would but refused to commit to a date. Finally, I sent him an email saying that if he didn't come for his stuff by X date, I would dispose of it all accordingly. He was absolutely furious with me over this - despite the fact that I gave him *six weeks* notice - but he did pick it up.)

119,Accidentally Zelle’d my landlord $2070 instead of $207. She is “adding it to my security deposit” instead of sending back the difference.,11u1tvg,"Hey all, my total for January and February utilities was $207.07. Yesterday I accidentally Zelle’d my landlord $2070.70 (admittedly idiotic mistake… ALWAYS take the extra 2 seconds to double check the transfer details). 

I immediately contacted her to let her know and ask to refund me the difference of $1863.63. I was fully expecting a refund with no follow-up dialogue. 

However, she told me she would be adding the extra amount to my security deposit and that I would get it back plus interest at the end of my lease, making it a win-win. I’m not in urgent need of the extra cash now or for the near future, but I would like to just undo my stupid mistake and get the excess money back. 

Any advice? I have no experience or knowledge dealing with these types of situations. I’ve thought about calling the police but that seems extreme and I figured there was a better course of action at this stage. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",Lagvill3,94,5230,0.99

Since he knew that he was going to get the the house and the garage in the end, he made the amazing decision to steal the garage door opener before returning to his home that’s 5 hours away.

A couple months ago, the owner of the store I work in (in California) came in especially angry at us. Triggered by the fact we hadn't put a ""sold out"" sign on a coin machine, he continued to scream at us about how he would ""never use a trans person's preferred pronouns because that's stupid and made up"" in front of all the customers. How a sold out coin machine can lead to that I can't really tell you, he'll use any reason to yell at us. Someone reported him to HR but given he pays HR all they did was made us sign something saying they held a harassment meeting. 

This isn't the first time he's come in like this. There are several accounts of him harassing my coworkers, he's even taken it to the point of calling them ""r*t*rds"" and making them cry. Luckily I'm still new enough that he doesn't acknowledge me when he comes, regardless of that I hate seeing my coworkers be treated like that. 

If we were to record him coming in and saying all these things, would we be able to use it to report him for workplace violence? Would that fall under OSHA guidelines? I would honestly appreciate any information on how to fight this given I'm not very familiar with labor laws yet.

I plan to move all of her things to a storage unit and tell her she can have it back when she pays her share of the bills. Am I legally in the right here?

Hey all. This is a pretty long story that has been going on for over a month now but I will try to summarize everything as quickly and efficiently as possible. I currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment with my girlfriend and one other girl. In early February this year, me and my girlfriend had a relatively big falling out with the roommate. We learned that she had been saying some untrue and disgusting things about us behind our backs to our friends and coworkers. When we confronted our roommate about this, she essentially ran away. It's been over a month since she's been back to the apartment. All of her stuff is still here. We never agreed to store any of it for her. (Also, this is probably important, she's not actually even on the lease). We decided we wouldn't ask her to pay for utilities as she hasn't been here, but since we are essentially storing her stuff, we are asking her for rent. Yesterday when we asked her for her portion of the rent (just a couple hundred dollars), she flat out refused. We told her that her that her stuff is still here so she needs to pay us a storing fee but she refused that as well. I read online that in my state, after 30 days any abandoned property belongs to whoever it is abandoned with or finds it next. So my plan for today is to pack up everything that she left in our apartment and put it in a storage unit. After that I will tell her that her stuff is gone and unless she decided to pay for her portion of the rent, we will be selling the stuff to cover her share. My question is, am I legally in the right here? Does she have any recourse in case she decides to call the cops and claim we ""stole"" her things?",FireBreathingSloth,0,1,0.67
124,Indiana Child Support and other family law questions,11vrk47,"Ok so I’ve reviewed the rules and the wiki so I hope I’m on the right track here but I have some questions about some family law issues that I’m looking to resolve.

For some background info, I am a 36 year old male in Indiana. My ex wife and I divorced about 3 years ago and we have 3 boys together, aged 10, 8, and 6. As part of the divorce, she received joint legal custody of all three boys while I was ordered to pay child support to the tune of ~$1500/month.

When we divorced, she moved with the boys to another city about 4 hrs away to be closer to her family. I get to have my boys every other weekend and for roughly 9-10 full weeks out of the year, as well as alternating holidays. It equals out to her having the boys about 70% of the time and me having them about 30%. We have a pretty solid coparenting relationship but I want more time with my boys while paying less in child support.

I plan on moving with my current wife to the city my ex lives in this summer so wet can accomplish that. Which brings me to my question(s):

1. Once upon a time I had heard that I would only be eligible for joint legal custody if I lived in the same school district as my children. I don’t know if this remains or was ever true but I can’t find any hard answers on this.

2. The way I understand it, I have to have joint legal custody to be able to eliminate child support if you support/have your children 50% of the time. Is this also true or am I going about this the hard way?

Basically I want to be able to have some freedom with where I live while also paying less or eliminating child support and having the boys considerably more than I already do (at least 50% of the time, if not more).

I didn't hear from her again.

I know the money is lost. But my question is, can she go to police about me asking for sexual services?

I am a computer expert. Since she used her actual email and the phone, I was able to track her. And it turned out that she has a boyfriend. So she was escorting while she was in a relation. I found her new phone number and texted her to give my money other wise I will inform her boyfriend. But she in turn threatened me that she will go to police as paying asking for sex in Canada is illegal.

129,"Are videos or images about physical violence such as fights, murder, mass-shootings... illegal to watch or to own?",11vqxwo,"When I am browsing Reddit, sometimes there are videos, images or footage about real fights, accidents, mass-shootings and even murder.

I am quite sure that **in the most serious cases** (murder, mass shootings...), the police already knows it or they are investigating it. And when it comes to things like physical fights, I guess that sometimes police intervenes and other times people just go their own way without legal consequences.

I would like to know if those videos and images are illegal. I have some quesions:

1. Do I need to report images or videos of physical violence (fights, accidents, mass-shooting and murder) to the police?
2. Is it illegal to watch those videos and images of fights, accidents, mass-shooting and murder?
3. Is it illegal to download them?

I have to admit that sometimes these kind of videos or images pop out in the default subreddit of Reddit (r/popular) or in a subreddit very known called *""CrazyFuckingVideos""*, and I feel very curious to watch them and I watch them. **E.g:** There was a video where a man was in the street and got in an argument with 2 of his neighbours and shot the 2 neighbours until killing them and killed himself. (I am quite sure that the police is aware that this happened). **E.g:** There is a video of an accident in a theme park where someone dies.

140,Upstairs Neighbour Keeps Taking Down Wyze Camera,11vp998,"Hi everyone,

I am a young adult female living in a basement suite and have been since November of last year. I installed a Wyze camera at the front of the house facing the street for the security of my car and packages.

The upstairs unit is now being rented by an older male who took the camera down upon moving in. When I asked for the camera back, he requested that I do not put it on the front of the house. I thought this was reasonable and asked if I could put it on the side of the house (where my door is) as a compromise, to which he agreed and even watched me reposition it. 

The next day, I received a text from the property manager mentioning that the upstairs tenant complained the camera was too close to the front of the house, despite him agreeing the day before. The text also said that it should not point at the door, which it did not. 

I sent both the upstairs tenant and the property owner a picture of what the camera sees, showing them that the camera did not capture the door or the front walkway. I did not receive a response. I have asked others for their advice and they have agreed that I reasonably accommodated his privacy concerns.

However, it has now become an issue where the upstairs tenant keeps unplugging or pulling the camera off of the Velcro strip I used to attach it to the house (since I am renting).

He seems to strongly believe that I will use the camera to spy on him, something I have zero intention of doing. I am beginning to wonder if the people that often come over in the early hours of the morning (I can hear their very loud footsteps and voices through the ceiling) are part of this reasoning, as that is when the camera is typically dismantled. 

I am getting increasingly concerned about the level of privacy that he is insistent on maintaining, especially since it is to the detriment of my safety. On one occasion, I believe he waited outside in an effort to try and confront me after I had replaced the camera, which was extremely unsettling. 

It is getting to the point that I am considering breaking the lease. Ideally, I do not want it to come to that, but the number of available options seems to be rapidly declining. I have ordered a more permanent camera mount that will screw into the siding (RIP damage deposit), but I do not know how long that will last.

141,Is this blackmail?,11vp748,"I have a friend, “Anna” (26F), who has a daughter, “Eva” (4). 
Long story short, Anna and I (23F) met when she was 7mo pregnant with Eva. At the time, Anna was getting out of an abusive relationship with Eva’s biological father. 
A little after Eva was born, she was removed and placed with Anna’s father (“Brian”) and stepmother for three months. Brian reported her to CPS, citing that she was “unstable” following the abusive relationship. She was certainly dealing with some symptoms of PTSD, however, she had a support system and Eva was thriving. 
Essentially, Anna had to take some parenting classes and one on avoiding the cycle of DV, then Eva came home, and CPS was no longer involved. 
However, every time that Anna goes out (i.e. St. Patrick’s Day this weekend) or dates someone new, Brian continuously threatens to get CPS involved and “take Eva back”. It’s important to note, if Anna goes out, Eva is in a safe place, usually at home with another close family member.
These threats usually take place when Brian is picking Eva up for weekend visits, which make Anna feel like there’s a veiled threat that he won’t give her back on the designated pickup day. Anytime Anna tries to skip a weekend visit, CPS is immediately brought up. Would this be considered blackmail and could any action be taken against the continuous threats?",DeerSad,1,1,0.67

143,Sued by Midland credit management,11vom53,"
* cross posted * we are in CA! 

Back in 2018 someone opened a credit card with my husbands name. 2020 was when we noticed because we trying to apply for a new car. We’re still fighting this case! 

Fast forward today, as we’re sitting at home, someone banged on our door & served my husband papers!

He’s being sued by Midland Credit Company. 

We read the full pack & it looks like someone opened a credit card to VS/PINK! A statement was provided but does not say when the account was open! Statement shows it was being sent to our old address where we used to live at my parents duplex & a payment made on May 2020 and Nov 2020! Address still being that old address! What’s bizarre is that this person made payments to this account.

We moved out of there July 2019 and my parents moved out of there March 2020! 

We never knew about this! We’re not credit card ppl. We barely check our credit!! We don’t have any credit cards. The only loan we have is our car! Which is almost paid off. 

Rewind: when we lived at the duplex with my parents. We had a neighbor that we shared address and mailbox with and during that time someone opened a credit card with my husbands name, we felt like it was his gf at the time! We filed a police report nothing was done! Then we thought it was my MIL because some transactions were near her area of living and out of nowhere my MIL started treating my husband and I very weird and almost defensive everytime we would see her & we never verbally said we thought it was her to her face but also our neighbor and his gf at the time did go towards that way sometimes! 

Anyways! We’re being sued by Midland Credit Company. The amount is for $1400. 

What should we do?! We have 30 days!! 

RN, we’re going thought a lot tremendously. I was just diagnosed with lupus and mentally have not been good and had to cut down my working days which now my husband is doing the best he can to help me, himself, and our 2 kids. COVID definitely hit us hard bc my husband is a barber, he’s finally rebuilding his business back up. I don’t want us to pay for something we didn’t do! 

How can we prove this?! They used our old address. The billing statement attached to this court docket is definitely not the full bank statements but the ones they sent us is from when we didn’t live at that address. I’m the court docket they stated they contacted us via phone and mail multiple times. We have never received anything! This is the first we’re ever hearing this!",Little_Detail2970,1,1,0.6
144,Scared of my groomer,11vojt8,"I'm using a throw away account for this, and I'm extremely scared of them to find out about this post

I'm 16 years, and I met this guy when I was about 13 (2020) and he was between 20-24 years old, on Reddit, he's from one country far away, and I'm from another
We became fast friends, and it didn't take a while we started to have sexual talks, at the time, I thought it was normal but I started to feel sick with this and often would leave him for periods of times because I felt disgusted 

We stoped doing this because Istopped it, but of course, he felt sad about it
During these three years of friendship he would make sexual jokes towards me and stuff like that, I would tell him I felt uncomfortable and he would still do it sometimes.
He also mentioned he dated a girl from his city who was 13 a few years before meeting me and he was over 18.

He always bought me gifts for free but last year he started telling me he'd buy them in exchange of nudes, I never gave it to him until this year, while I am now 16 and he is 26

Often he gets drunk and starts telling me he's going to kill himself, that people leave him, and that he loves me, I feel absolutely terrible and I don't know what to do.

The last time I snapped and sent him more pictures than he asked because I had a mental breakdown, he promised he'd buy more stuff, but today, he asked why I had those pictures, to who i was going to send it to, and I said it was none of his business.

He started saying how he with he was my boyfriend and overall, it made me feel bad, again.

He has one of my family members address, my phone number, my full name and one of my family members CPF... And nudes.
I'm scared, I was a dumb person and didn't follow what my parents taught me, I trusted people too much and now I'm frustrated and scared he's going to do something, please help! My parents know about him but I don't want to tell them about this, is there anything else I can do?",ComprehensiveTap4498,4,1,0.57

I tried getting disability through the state but was denied. Is there some kind of way to seek financial compensation now that I was proven to have this allergy the whole time?

Is that just their way of nicely saying it’s not worth their time? I’ve easily inquired with over 15 firms and got no response on like 6 of them, a few said it’s not an area of law they practice, and the remaining said they were too busy to take new cases. All in all I got scammed out of over 10% of the cars value and have a lot in writing of them admitting to it so I wouldn’t think it would be necessarily a hard case to prove for an attorney, but I don’t know shit about this stuff so I don’t really know what to do. 

Do I just have to deal with it and accept that this kind of robbery in broad daylight is just accepted in our society? I get that for a law firm, 4000 dollars isn’t necessarily a big payday for them but surely there’s some way I can hold this dealer accountable for this and “maybe” recover some of the money they scammed me on? Last I checked it’s illegal to sell cars this way, but yet it seems like there’s no way to hold them accountable so what’s the point of it even being illegal?

I felt so bad for the other person! I was actually able to get half of the person's tag #, and their tag was a blue antique tag, so I told the person that information.

So from what I was told by the store clerk the next day the person waited for hours for the cops and the person who ran wasn't caught...


So this morning I go to the SAME store, and low and behold I see the PERSON WHO HIT AND RAN A COUPLE WEEKS AGO!!! I could not believe it! In the store buying cigarettes and lottery, acting brand new!

So I got pictures of their tag this time, since I was behind them pulling out of the store. While they sat their for 2 freaking minutes, when no traffic was coming, acting like no one had anywhere to be, lighting their cigarette, taking their sweet time to pull out. So I took pics of their tag.

152,Illegal EMS worker pay?,11vnjhd,"I work for an ambulance service in Arkansas and believe that some of our employees are not being paid appropriately. Minimum wage in our state is $11/hour and I’m not sure we are lawfully paid for overtime. Can someone help me research and understand the labor laws regarding this? 

We are EMS workers and our pay for EMT’s break down as such:

Starting EMTs are paid 32,000/year. Our hourly base pay is adjusted to not go above or below the annual pay of 32,000/year. Meaning, different positions offer different pay and regardless of how many hours we work in those positions, we will make around $1000 bi-weekly after taxes. 

We are not paid overtime until we work over the designated number of hours for our position. 

For example: 
24 hour EMT— 120 hours/pay period at $9.78/hour (below minimum wage). 
12 hour EMT— 86 hours/pay period at $13.99/hour. 
10 hour EMT— 80 hours/pay period at $15.38/hour.

A 24 hour EMT doesn’t get paid overtime until they work beyond 120 hours in a 14 day period.
12 hour EMT doesn’t get paid overtime until working over 86 hours in a 14 day period. 
10 hour EMT doesn’t get paid overtime until they work over 80 hours in a 14 day period.

Our paystubs are impossible to read. Upon request I can show you how impossible they are to calculate and understand.

That aside, I do not see how 24 hour EMT’s are legally being paid below minimum wage, or how 12 and 24 hour EMTs are not being paid time and half after working 40 hours in a work week or 80 hours in a pay period. 

I also don’t understand the legality behind adjusting our base hourly wage to fit the 32,000 salary. Our checks have built in overtime that we don’t get paid for. 

Please help me with any resources or English breakdowns of the laws so I can understand if this is legal or not.

Details:

I (26F) and boyfriend (39M) are looking to buy a house, together, with his money cause I've got nada. As far as down payments are concerned, he's taking the financial risk & I've just got the mental anguish of not having large amounts of money to contribute.  We both have good credit scores, neither of us have any debts, or anything that would impact loans.

We've done the math & know what we can afford, we're also trying to keep this fair arrangement wise - he pays the down payment, I pay greater % of monthly mortgage payments & we each own our % of the house should something go sideways. 

What we're stuck on is understanding how to accomplish 'unequal ownership' with a changing ownership percentage?

Do we go with a co-borrowing agreement and get both our names on the mortgage?

165,Splitting equity with spouse who is putting down payment,11vkl0g,"My spouse and I are considering purchasing with her putting down a large percentage of the down payment using some inheritance received in past 5 years. This would push the timeline of home ownership forward and both are in agreement of how we would split the mortgage payments going forward. 

With regards to legal equity of the home, would a post-nup agreement satisfy percentage ownership by time of future sale (this won’t be our forever home)? 

Example: Home is 500k. She puts in 200k down payment and we split mortgage. 5 years later we sell the house with none to little appreciation. After 5 years I end up putting 100k into the mortgage and she puts in 100k. End result is 300k on her end and 100k on my end. Our sale would result in her committing 60% and I would have committed 20%.

The trash services I pay for never come, the leasing office is impossible to get a hold of, my neighbors steal my Amazon packages, the list goes on.

I had already asked for a pdf via email, text, and call, but nothing ever came of it. When i asked in person today, they said they actually couldn’t find it.

I’m young and this is my first time renting from a property management company on my own. For some reason, I thought I had signed a lease in the course of the application, but I was wrong. I’ve paid my deposit and rent for this month, my resident portal works and I’m treated as a fully-fledged tenant, but there’s no actual documentation anywhere. The complex straight up forgot to send it to me and I was too dumb to notice, apparently.

If I don’t call next Monday, wait until I’m completely ready to move out, and then let them know that I never signed the lease and don’t want to, can I move out without incident?

One of the two has left an incredible amount of garbage (including broken glass that’s injured my dog) and has improperly disposed of waste water as well as asbestos in open air dumpsters. 

The other’s roof has collapsed twice. Their prior tenants sprayed toxic chemicals without any warning to us neighbors (while we’ve had window ac’s adjacent to the structure). So we’ve inhaled the the toxic air and particles. 

The major and immediate concern is right next door. Their roof has collapsed before. Building is empty and there’s excessive mold on the buildings exterior. I can only imagine the current and future state of its interior. It’s also become a breeding ground for rodents and roaches (German roaches being the hardest to keep out of our building).

I'm a 22 year old female in my last semester of college. This is in America in the state of New Mexico. This happened in August, 2022. Bought a car from someone who told me their car was in decent shape and does not have any major problems, other than the spark plugs and a door not being able to open from one side. I bought the 2003 car for $2k, and was driving the car to get the car registered and insured.  Turns out that, in addition to the issues beforehand, the brakes also didn't work. Found that out when I crashed into the back of a officer's car (a regular vehicle, not a cop car) while they were going to get their sick kid from school. I felt terrible when I learned this.

Thankfully, no one was injured. The driver's car had their bumper detached and some dents, and my car's trunk was nearly folded in half with some radiator fluid leaking out of the bottom of the car. I profusely started apologizing and practically begging for mercy. I told them why I was driving and where I was going, that I'm uninsured but I'll pay them for the damages or repay them through labor, and provided all my contact information. The officer was extremely calm and understanding, and I was told that I'll only need to pay $500 for the insurance. We contacted each other the same day to confirm contact info, and I was updated that I would actually pay $250 and provided proof. I paid that in full. I thought I was in the clear.

I was not, in fact, in the clear.

Got a call in late February from the insurance company that I would need to pay about $8k or a $6k settlement. The settlement offer is open until the end of this month, and will only go up in price. I was also given payment options, and told that I could have my driver's license suspended until I pay in full (I'm honestly fine with never driving again. I get flashbacks every time someone driving me around brakes a little too close to another car). Even when I said that I had already reimbursed the insured, they told me that this is not how insurance works and that I was only paying the beginning part of the bill. I was also told that the insurance does not always tell their clients what their processes are, which I found weird.

They were supposed to go the next day to check on them and they never went. My loved one was found several days later. 
 
My question- do I have a case of wrongful death against the dealer who sold the deadly drugs?

I reached out again to ask him to stop and wish him the best and to let him know my fiance and I do not want drama and for him to tell people to stop. Also told him I do not want to receive those type of messages anymore.

He threatened to file harassment claim. 

I told him I would file too.

What I didn't tell him is that I am thinking about filing a sexual assault claim against him. I didn't before because I was scared and had no proof. At least now I have proof that I messaged him about what he did to me.

Can he file a harassment claim when he keeps driving around my place? I don't have much evidence besides the messages I send him about it. 

Also, can I still file a sexual assault claim? I tried not to for the sake of his daughter and the fact that I did not have evidence for a sexual assault claim. I have messages I sent to him but he never acknowledged them.

We've been staying with this roommate for about a year now (3 of us total living in the unit), and since our apartment's payment website doesn't have options for split payment, me and my sister have been sending our combined 2/3 of the rent to him over paypal, as he was on the lease originally and we moved in after the fact. 

Everything had been going alright for most of the year, but about two months ago, two weeks after I had sent him the rent for the month of February ($1,100 for me and my sister's portion), I got a call from the apartment telling me that they were unable to get in contact with him as his phone was no longer in service, and that we had failed to pay rent for the month. I talked to him in person, and he assured me he was aware of the issue and that he had already resolved the matter with them.

About two weeks ago, I got another call from the apartment telling me that no, he had in fact not dealt with it, and that if we didn't get payment taken care of they'd have to give us a 30 day eviction notice. I spoke to him again in person, and he again assured me that he was working through it with his parent's assistance, and I once again (rather foolishly, in hindsight) took him at his word, and we sent this month's rent as well.

Yesterday I woke up to our apartment having no electricity, and it still hasn't come back. After calling the electric company, we found out he was already $500 overdue on the power bill, and we'd have to pay more than $900 to get it turned back on. This morning, I finally got the notice from the apartment.

He hasn't been home since the power went out, and I haven't been able to contact him at all, as he doesn't have a phone, and I don't know his email. I don't know his financial status at all, but I assume not great.

If my wife signs it, but I don't, and both names are on the deed, is it enforceable? Does this waiver appear fair to you, or should we look to change this?",11va2rj,"Hello!


The HOA for my community is asking its members to sign a waiver of liability and a covenant to not sue for the following topics:


 (1) I am to accept and assume any/all risk of injury or property damage whether caused by negligence of the HOA or otherwise.

(2) I am to waive and release all officers, directors of the HOA from any and all injuries and loss by present, future, foreseen, unforeseen circumstances related to usage of the areas in the HOA.
 
(3) Use of beach badges provided by the HOA waives HOA liability and covenants to not sue the HOA for ""any and all such claims""
       

The HOA leadership wants us to sign this waiver waiving all liability, but we are also paying $3900 in liability insurance and $2000 in officer liability. It seems we are paying liability insurance for when we are waiving all ability to take action in the first place. 


Is this two-pronged approach of the HOA taking money for liability insurance while also making members waive all ability to sue the HOA legal? 


Furthermore, if my wife signs the waiver, but I don't, is it still enforceable when both names are on the deed and votes for HOA meetings are given based on property ownership and we only get one vote as a household, possibly showing that property ownership is based on a bipartite approach toward our one vote? To me, it seems that in this case, if one person were not to sign, it wouldn't seem right. 


My wife and I have one vote together in HOA meetings as both our names are on the deed, so would it be enforceable for this waiver if only my wife signs it but I don't? It seems like both of us together is what creates the one vote, so I feel like it would only be enforceable if both of us sign the waiver.

However, the real issue I have is with my roommates boyfriend. He has since moved into our shared dorm. I had no prior knowledge to this situation otherwise I would’ve outwardly expressed some concern. Due to issues in the past with my roommate I decided to pick and choose my battles. 
The main issue-This previous week was spring break. My family relocated across the state. Therefore, I couldn’t go home for spring break, So I stayed in my dorm. However, my roommate left to go home (about 4 hours away). Naturally I assumed that, her boyfriend, would stay at his house. This was not the case. On Wednesday this previous week, I nearly had a heart attack because someone had come into my dorm banging stuff around. I seriously feared for my safety and well being. Immediately, I texted my roommate asking if she was home. She told me that she wasn’t home right now but her boyfriend was & she was at work. To make things worse, she gave him a key to our shared dorm and he came and went as he pleased all through spring break even bringing his dog.
Here are my main issues:
-I contacted the CA twice but they were not much help.
-I genuinely feared for my safety because I knew my roommate hadn’t been home and someone walked into my home.
-It’s against school policy to give keys to other people. Let alone let someone stay over for my than 3 conservative nights.

I've been researching around and most of the anecdotes of ticket lawyer success stories have been cases of speeding tickets or something where a cop is involved - a cop that probably won't show up to court resulting in dismissal.

But for me they have photo and video evidence. So I'd rather not spend money on a lawyer to go to court and then I have to pay the ticket anyways.

I know some states [violationinfo.com](https://violationinfo.com) doesn't have any real authority and you can just ignore the tickets, but I'm not familiar with what the situation is where I'm from (i.e. Broward county, FL )

The other option is for me to go to court myself and plead my case (I was behind a large truck so I didn't see the light turn red until right as I got to the line. You can see me breaking through the intersection in the video.) Maybe a sympathetic judge would reduce the price.

Anyways, some input or guidance would be appreciated.",Materwelon91,1,2,0.63

210,Bought a Misrepresented Car,11vbt0x,"Ok. So i bought a 2013 Honda Civic from Facebook under the impression that the car had 113,000 miles. The digital odometer even read 113,000 miles.

When I took the title to register it at the DMV, the DMV told me that the car's last recorded mileage was 185,000 in 2019.  Not only that, but there was also an issue with the title since the seller hadn't transferred it in his name yet.

In order to rectify both the discrepancy with the odometer and the seller not transfering the title in his name before selling it to me, the DMV had me go back to the seller in order to fill out a bill of sales form. The bill of sales form also had an odometer option where I could explain the reason for the odometer discrepancy.

Anyways, I tell the seller that I was falsely mislead into thinking the car had 113,000 miles on it. The seller claims that he had no role in rolling back the odometer and that the other person he got it from must have done it. I told him that that didn't matter since he advertised on facebook that the car had 113,000 miles on it and even if he answered truthfully to the best of his knowledge, that I was still mislead into buying a car with 113,000 miles and that if I knew the engine could have easily 300,000 miles on it since the last recorded mileage with the DMV was back in 2019 woth 185,000 miles.

Moreover, the DMV made me wrote an affadavit attesting that I had nothing to do with rolling back the odometer and that if I had known the correct mileage, that I would not have purchased the car.

I told him I wanted my money back and ever since then he had ceased communications with me. I have copies of our messages and also took a screenshot of the car he posted on facebook with the odometer details and everything.

I don't want to take the guy to small claims court as I have read that the court will not compel him to pay and that it would essentially be me that has to be the debt collector if I were to win.

211,Someone in our school is trying to murder our friend - what and who should we talk to?,11vk1gu,"Location: Sweden, Europe

I have no idea if this is considered NSFW but this is quite disturbing. I also don't know if this is supposed to be in this subreddit.

This is not a shitpost. 

TLDR; A person in our grade has told a friend of ours that she would like to murder one of my closest friend and asked if another friend would like to help her. The friend told us about the situation and we strongly believe we should report her to someone. But we don’t know what to do or who to talk to. Advice? 

/////

There’s a lot to explain and I will not go in any further detail as it is very obnoxious. I’m happy to take advice and questions.

It all started when this girl, (who we’ll call) Sarah joined my friend’s (Alex) Spanish class. She quickly became obsessed with our friend group and started stalking some people. Not the basic “stalking online” or “checking the parent’s Facebook” but actually hiding in front of Alex’s house. The first time she did this, he saw Sarah and told her that if this would happen again he would report her to police. And he was serious. 

After that, we really thought it was over as nothing really happened, or so we thought.

&#x200B;

Despite Alex telling her to stop, she did this four more times and told our friend Claire (who Sarah think is her best friend) about it. Alex doesn’t know about this as this would freak him out. Fast forward, Sarah has told Claire that she believes in some sort of ""angles"" who tell her what to do. She also think that she and Alex are somehow connected and that they are meant to be soulmates - just that he doesn't want to accept the fact yet. Claire explained that Sarah once took a ""BDSM-test"" and her results were ""99% sadism"". Obviously, she seems very ill and she needs someone to help her, but the following is so disgustingly hideous it makes me think she needs something like a mental hospital.

&#x200B;

Claire has told me that Sarah is very obsessed with everyone in the friend group, everyone except for my closest friend Lucas. For some reason, she does not like him at all, and wants to get rid of him - for good. Apparently, she is very serious with this. Last week, Claire sat in a phone call with Sarah while I sat beside her listening on speaker (Sarah had no idea of my presence of course). She explained how it would feel super nice to just stab him with a knife in the chest - and she even said she could do this in school. This terrified me as I did not think it was this serious and we quickly told both Lucas and Alex about it. We agreed that we have to talk to someone but we have no idea who. We considered talking to police, but all of us just recently turned 18 and we have no idea how it works. We then thought about it and instead booked a meeting with the principal in a couple days, but I am still sceptical and I keep thinking if this is the right decision or not. 

We really need any advice we can get on what to do and if we should talk to someone. As quickly as possible.",atonedal2,7,0,0.29

Anyway. They ended up towing my car and taking me to the station to do finger prints and such. But the thing I’m confused about is, aren’t they supposed to read you your Miranda rights when you get arrested? Yk, “you have the right to remain silent, yada yada yad”? Because they didn’t?

I know the difference between a service dog and an ESA. My dog is being trained as a service dog.***

My service dog in training and I are living in a homeless shelter as I'm trying to figure out how I need to get back on my feet.

Thing is, there was a woman (Kelly) here who had her own dog that she claimed was a service dog, though he had none of the training you'd expect from a service dog. I know she had been going in my room a lot, and I know she stole some of my dog's food, and I've been told by other people that she's a thief. Here's the problem. I've been looking and looking and looking, and I can't find my dog's documentation anywhere. I'm going to go back over everything and double check before I actually report it stolen. Kelly actually has the same PCP that I do, so I don't know if that will change anything.

But here's the deal: one of the people in charge (Jack) is actually pretty good friends with Kelly, and Jack's grandson married Kelly's niece. The shelter director kicked Kelly out for meth, but Jack finally found her a week later and brought her back.

223,My “friends” stole my dog.,11vap6h,"The crime happened in California. This last summer, I had a breakdown. I thought I had maybe saw or felt spirits, and I called my friend to tell her what happened and get help. She was going somewhere that day and said she would stop by to see me, but I guessed I rushed  her so she told me she would send some people to check on me. Lo and behold I open up the door and it’s the 51/50 people, shortly followed by the police who take me to the psych ward. After that happened, my friend came to my apartment and took my puppy. After I spend 10 days in the hospital, I’m out, and I call my friend to ask for my dog back. She talks about how happy he is there and how they’re on vacation. Some time passed and it became clear that they weren’t going to give him to me. I called other members of their family and they went so far as to accuse me of neglecting my dog, all because when they came to take him, there was pee on the ground. He was a puppy. He had a small bladder, and probably got scared seeing me get snatched away, and anyways I had no idea what happened after I was gone, he could have peed in the time I was away. Regardless he was so spoilt so it makes my blood boil to think they could say that just from seeing a little accident he had. 

I called the police to get help and they told me she could be charged with grand theft of an animal. Then the police decide to drop the case because when they reviewed the body cam footage of me getting taken away, I said my friends were good people (I don’t remember this). They also called my mom, and she said they could take care of him while I was away so the police said they couldn’t do anything and if I wanted to get him back I’d have to sue my mom. It doesn’t make sense to me because my mom had no ownership of the dog and shouldn’t be able to make decisions like that. 

I don’t know what to do. The dog is AKC registered to my name. I have text messages saying they were going to give him back. I could sue for small claims but it would only get me money, not my dog back. The problem is I don’t have much money so I can’t hire a lawyer. If anyone can help me by telling me any pro bono or reduced rate lawyers that would be really appreciated. If you have any other ideas on what to do please please let me know.

225,Car warrant won't cover damage.,11vag7t,"Recently, my girlfriend was driving her 2014 Mazda CX-5 which she had purchased from a partnered Toyota dealership three months prior when the ball joint on the control arm broke during a low speed left hand turn. Unfortunately, several other components were damaged in the incident and the total repairs are expected to cost $2400 - $3600. My girlfriend purchased an extended warranty through AAGI which covers transmission, suspension, and engine failures. When the warranty company came out to inspect the damage, they said that they will not cover the damage because rust and corrosion caused the ball joint to fail(there is an exclusion in their contract for damage caused by rust and corrosion).
So, the problem that I and my girlfriend have is that, three months ago the car would have gone through used car prep where components of the car that are damaged would be inspected and replaced so it is ready for sale, and wee confirmed that this prep occured with the manager of the dealership. If the ball joint had rust and corrosion damage bad enough for it to fail like that, it absolutely would have noticed during inspection and the parts replaced before selling the car. The dealership even read the inspection report to us and it does not list the ball joints as an item that needed repair, and confirmed that if they had been damaged, they would have been replaced.
All this is to say that I do not believe that in less than three months, the ball joints could have gone from perfect conditions to completely rusty and corroded enough for them to just pop apart during a low speed turn. So, either the dealership failed at the used car prep or the ball joints were defective and broke for some other reason.

The car was registered in Florida, sold in Florida by me (the only owner) to a young man (M19) from Georgia. The car in question had over 80k miles and was nearly 11 years old at this point. I disclaimed as many of its faults as I was possibly aware of. Even faults I suspected were coming, such as replacing the clutch, new brake pads, new tires etc. It’s a semi-desirable car and I had no reason to lie in order to get it sold. I was as honest as I could be and happy to sell it to a young man who I thought would enjoy it.

Fast forward a couple weeks and he has been constantly calling me to complain about silly things such as a dead battery which I suspect is due to him leaving the lights on. And the clutch not feeling right (he admitted to not being great at manual cars and needed practice so I suspect he just smoked the already aging clutch). He’s too young and inexperienced to understand that older cars like mine aren’t perfect and faults are inevitable.

His checks already cleared and all the paperwork (title transfer and bill of sale) was completed. I’ve already spent the money purchasing a new car.

My boyfriend and I live together with a few roommates. One of the roommates that we live with has refused to pay the shared electric and gas bill, and despite my partner’s attempts to talk it through with him has essentially tried to blackmail/coerce him.

All of this started when said roommate’s girlfriend lost her keys in the house, and he accused us of taking the keys. We didn’t take the keys, but this roommate is convinced that we did because we were in the room the keys were last in right before they went missing. We told him that the couch in the shared living space has a void that things fall into (the keys ended up being exactly where we said they were) and they most likely were in there, but he said that we planted them there. 

We have written and verbal refusal from this roommate, as well as refusal to stop using our property when we told him we didn’t want him to use it anymore (we ended up moving most of our things out early into a storage unit due to this).

He has told my partner that he will not pay what is owed unless my boyfriend admits on camera to stealing the keys (which we did not do). As Minnesota is a one-party consent state, we have him recorded saying this.

We don’t have a written contract saying that the utilities are split evenly between roommates, but our lease states that the tenants are all responsible for electric and gas.

231,20k was taken from my bank relating to a court levy from a case that does not pertain to me. Cant get it back.,11uzyq3,"  

About a month ago I loged into my bank account and realized that all of my money was gone (**20k dollars**  were withdrawn without my knowledge or consent from my bank account) Shocked, I contacted my bank and they informed  me that I was served a Levy by Child Support Services from the state of California. 

Having no children I was surprised and in great distress. I posited as possibilities that I have been subject of identity theft, miss identification or something of the sort. 

The legal department of the bank´s customer service provided me with the phone number regarding some agency relating to the state of California with whom I was able to dig up some information. 1) The participant number relating to this levy 2) The social workers who are overseeing this case in the span of two (Stanislaus and Merced) and even 3)the name of the mother who received the money.

After talking with the social workers I learnt that the total money sought by the levy amounts $101,044. 07 (which If I had had on my bank account they would have surely removed it). I was then redirected with the person involved in their department who handles “this sort of cases”. She requested further information from me in order to complete their internal profile and to un-link me from this particular case. She promised to talk with some people from the state in order to try to resolve this.

Fast forward a month they told me that after talking with the people from the state of California and after them reviewing my case, there was nothing that could be done to get the money back. The reason mentioned was that I did not take action within the first 10 days since the bank have sent a letter. However, I do not live on that address, actually I like outside of the country, so there was no way in which I could have seen the letter. And even now, that I had the mailbox checked such letter is not on there. The people from the child support services said that since that 10 day period is over, there is nothing that I could do to claim the money and that “their hands were tied”.

The only posibiliti, that they vaguely mentioned is that if the person who received the money would return it. However they also said that they are unshure if it its even allowed to tell the person that that money had been wrongfully allocated to them. But this leaves me wondering, what would happen if they do identify the person who owned that money, would she be left, at the end of the day, double of what was assigned in the court case?

They also suggested me to talk to my bank. Which I did and they explained that they have no choice but to follow the instructions given by the court in question according to the some family code  **family code sc 17530 section c** (I have not verified this, and even unsure that I have written this correctly).

Having no positive answer from the bank nor the agency, I don’t know who to turn. I have no experience with the U. S. legal system and unsure how to proceed. What document should I gather? What kind of lawyer should I approach and so on… 

Mind you, that during this time, I have not been able to realize any payments since they took all of my money, and the fees are going to start to add up. Additionally, well I need that money to complete some transactions, and well cover my expenses, so there is a sense of urgency. And I´m wasting all this time dealing with these. I would also like to receive some sort of compensation for this. 

It´s incredible for me that this sort of things can happen. Life saving can just vanished in an instant and one be locked away from them since I did not check my mailbox or bank account within 10 days…

234,Employer Tuition Reimbursement,11v8kd6,"Hi! I'm looking for advice on how to handle a situation with my employer. I have worked for the company for almost 20 years. Three years ago, I took advantage of their education reimbursement program and began working on a Bachelor's degree. The way it works is that I pay for my tuition and get reimbursed for every class I make at least a B in. My company's financial situation has been going downhill for the past year or so. Our HR director informed me yesterday that the tuition reimbursement program has been terminated as a cost-cutting measure and those of us in the program will no longer be reimbursed for tuition, including the current semester. My problem with that is it's right in the middle of the semester and I've paid my tuition and related expenses - to the tune of over $800. Several other employees have paid up to $2200 for this semester and we're essentially being screwed out of our money. Also, my employer has reimbursed me almost $15k so far.  The agreement states that the tuition will be forgiven over 3 years after I finish my degree. I won't finish for another 2-3 years (I'm going part-time since I work 40-50 hours/week). Since they have essentially broken the contract, shouldn't they start my 3-year forgiveness now, since they will not be reimbursing any future tuition? Is there anything I can do to make them honor the agreement and reimburse me for the current semester's tuition? 

Thanks in advance for any advice on this.",imnottellingyou53,6,1,0.6

We got the unit in march 2022 and it was a 13 month lease. in April 2022 there was a STRONG smell of smoke in the bathroom and bedroom - coming in through the ventilation system. We immediately alerted the landlord and after a couple of months of silence I got a doctors note (I have health conditions that flare during this). 

We were back and forth for months and she did nothing. Finally in Feb 2023 we got a new apartment starting March 1. We asked them to find a new attendant and were very accommodating but they only found one for April 1 and are demanding March rent. 

I understand we had a lease but do we have any power here? I have months of emails of them neglecting to do anything about the smoke and claiming they were ordering devices to check on it which never happened.

243,Can I be fired from my healthcare job for going into a psychiatric hospital?,11veeu3,"So, I’ve been doing really well the last 3 months. I’ve stayed sober and out of the hospital!! I was going inpatient 2x a month before that. 

For context, I have schizoaffective bipolar type (an easy way to think about this is I have bipolar 1 and schizophrenia combined into one diagnosis). This has been well documented. I also had sobriety issues with cannabis (and other drugs but primarily cannabis). See, the THC in cannabis triggers my schizoaffective disorder to the point where I become completely destabilized and have to be hospitalized. Now, that disorder can get bad without the cannabis and started before I used cannabis. It’s just that cannabis makes it so much worse.

So, I relapsed and ate cannabis edibles over the last 3 days. Im not high anymore. I live somewhere where regular cannabis is illegal but the delta 8 stuff is legal (which is what I had). 

But, now today, I’m scared. I know I’m living in a simulation and that everyone except me and the angels I’m hearing are robots. The voices are telling me how to kill myself (basically OD’ing on my sleep meds and edibles as I had one sleeping med and an edible the other day and I stopped breathing a couple of times since they are both depressants). I don’t know if I’m gonna act on that or not. I called my on-call psychiatrist (before the angels started telling me to kill myself) and she said to call back if I have thoughts of harming myself. I called the local psych hospital and they said if I can’t keep myself safe then to call back.

Im now at the point where I’m not sure if I need psychiatric inpatient. The biggest thing holding me back from going is that I started a new job 2 months ago. I do the work of a CNA just without the CNA certificate (officially called a caregiver). I was told if we miss more than 4 days in the first 90 days we’ll be fired. Does this extend to being hospitalized? 

I’ve had a conversation with my boss about my schizoaffective diagnosis. All she said was if I show symptoms at work I’ll be drug tested. Also, the attendance at work is so strict that even if we are super sick, if we don’t find our own coverage we can get written up.

244,Eviction of an unlawful guest/resident from a tenant in Washington State,11vbzst,"They are two people who signed no contracts but have given money at one point, but also threatened violence.

The initial issue is the people who haven’t paid rent, aren’t on the lease, and refuse to leave had some violent threats. About the money: The first paid the agreed first months rent and the second payed first months rent late. They haven’t paid this months rent. It is the second month an they haven’t left, even after having another person, who didn’t pay rent and wasn’t on a lease, kicked out. 

The first person-with-no-lease threatened violence when only my girlfriend was at the residency with them, and they have a violent criminal record, which is why both illegal guests need to get the fuck out.

They have pets and belongings in the apartment in their room. The address isn’t on their legal paperwork or been sent to the house as all mail to the address has stop being sent by the post office months ago.  Thy have not been there 90 days, either of them. I have paid the rent myself, in whole, all but one month in which they paid half. 

As the lease-holder i did research and need a few questions answered before i can change the lock, give their animals to a pound, and leave their shit on the curb:

How much room do I legally have to remove them from the premises?
Do they have any laws protecting them from eviction or ejection?
Are they considered guests or residents, and if they can be banned from the residence by the owner of the property?
As the only legal tenant of the residency am I allowed to force them out?
Can they be kicked out in anyway because of the threat if violence that is in writing from their text messages?
Are there literally ANY loopholes to getting  the non-contracted, criminally evicted for violent crimes person OUT?

247,Clause in lease about condition of the apartment and how it might relate to my case? Does it even matter?,11v6wlp,"Hello,
Just wanted to ask for some insight on my situation. 
I signed a lease a bit over a month ago for an apartment and moved in a week ago. When I first viewed the apartment, the tenant was still living there and she said she had no problems at all. Place looked great and didn’t see any issues. 

I came in about 2 weeks ago a few days technically past my “move in day” to do a little cleaning.  I saw roach feces scattered all over an outlet the cabinets and a dead roach on top of the cabinet. Of course I reached out to the landlord to address this, and he cleaned it and said he sprayed but didn’t really tackle much of the problem in the cabinets. I decide to move in slowly while I hire a cleaner and exterminator.
A week later I’ve moved in. I see roach feces in my fridge and dead roaches in my freezer a day after (I believe the dead roaches may have been in the freeezer already but I never looked hard enough). I tell the landlord about this and it takes him a few days because he’s away but he decides to come to my apartment and take apart all the cabinets and caulk holes. See a few roaches and alot of roach poop and alot of holes. He till doesn’t do anything about the fridge or gasket though and will not hire an exterminator, telling me to wait for the one that comes the first Saturday of every month. He continues to act surprised saying that this has never happened before and the previous tenant never complained about pests (she told me she had no issues either). I have photo evidence of everything above btw.

At this point, I don’t really feel comfortable in my own apartment anymore. 

There is a clause in my lease about the apartment and it reads such: 
“When You signed this Lease, You did not rely on anything said by Owner, Owner's agent or superintendent about the physical condition of the Apartment, the Building or the land on which it is built. You did not rely on any promises as to what would be done, unless what was said or promised is written in this Lease and signed by both You and Owner or found in Owner's floor plans or brochure shown to You before You signed the Lease. Before signing this Lease, You have inspected the apartment and You accept it in its present condition ""as is,"" except for any condition which You could not reasonably have seen during your inspection. You agree that Owner has not promised to do any work in the Apartment except as specified in attached ""Work"" rider.”

I was wondering if this line was something that could be used to break a lease if it gets to that point for me. I understand that roaches are normal in apartment buildings but I feel I was presented an apartment that was not in a clean and habitable state and it has taken its toll on me in the past few days.

250,Validity of indecent conduct written warning (Ohio),11v6iu5,"Hello all. Not sure of correct flair for this, and this is a throw away account if that matters.

Had hopefully a straightforward legal question to help me process something.

Getting right to it, my fiancee and I were just a little while ago, Frankly, making out, when a cop appeared at our window.

For context: we were at a 100% empty aprk when it was cold out, and light snow so very unlikely any one would show up. All clothes were on the entire time. She was about halfway in the passenger seat and partially on me. Admittedly, my hand was also on her rear end.

The officer (a ranger I think) ended up giving us a written warning for ""indecent conduct"". He said if it happens again it could be escalated, get a ticket and potentially register as a sex offender or something.

When looking up Ohio's public indecency laws, I see two things, one it has to be likely to be seen by other people, it was not as it was empty and that first offense is a fourth degree misdemeanor:
https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-2907.09

Now I understand what we did was likely not smart, we get that. But to me it feels like what he said was a exaggeration? Would I be correct? Or is he completely right or what?

Also just for extra detail he was standing outside the car window for at least a minute or two, seemingly watching us. He never knocked on our window, we saw him and opened the door. He may have been waiting to see if we were going to escalate but it gave us both bad vibes.

Our home is in a suburb managed by the county so we are not on city water, our water is managed by a small company ran by a volunteer group of homeowners in the area. Last summer they delivered everyone in the neighborhood a letter saying one of the wells they use to provide homes with water had dried up and the other was very low. This was news to us and when I bought the house in 2019 there was no information shared with me about wells running low. They were seeking funds to dig a new well but wanted everyone to pay $2,000. My wife was pregnant with our second child at the time, we were paying for my older daughter to go to pre school, and I was paying for my masters out of my own pocket so I could not afford to just pay that right then and there. I was told at the time by the person who brought me the letter that payment plans would be an option. Not long after I contacted the manager of the water company about setting up a payment plan and what options I had. He was adamant that I pay it in full, but I told him I couldn’t and was told I could set up a payment plan and wanted to know what options I had. He told they weren’t really wanting to do that but that they approved a 4 time $500 plan for another homeowner. I asked what the other options were just to weight my options and was told “the board won’t accept anything less than that” and that I should look into getting a loan. Lol. 

I told him I would talk to my wife but asked what would happen if I can’t pay $500 a month for 4 months and he said “I guess I would have to tell the board you can’t make your payment and if you don’t make your payment our neighborhood will run out of water”. Fast forward to September of last year this man with 2 other men who were also board members showed up at my house on a Sunday afternoon asking for my payment again. I brought up the same questions and was given the same answers. They told me they would need my payment by the end of the year and again I asked what if I can’t pay the full amount by then? I asked again about payment plans because I am a homeowner in the neighborhood, I care about the issue and want to contribute, but the message I was given was still basically all or nothing with no info about payment plans. Since then I haven’t heard anything until today I got a notice taped to my door saying that if I don’t make my payment in full May 17th (3 months from now) my water will be shut off.

256,"We (3 females) found termites in the place we’re currently renting in California, and the landlord wants us to just permanently move without any compensation. What should we do?",11vf8tg,"This is my first post asking for help and it’s a bit of a story but hang in there. 

We recently found termites in the house that we’ve been renting for only 2 months in Southern California. It seems like they have already eaten a part of the structural beam and are all over the house. They will most likely have to fumigate and do some construction on the house, but our landlord cannot give us a time frame of when it’ll be done. They asked us to (permanently) move out, with the possibility of moving back if we want to after everything is done. We’ll happily do so if they can accommodate our needs. We’ve also had a bad start to this landlord/tenant relationship due to other things but that’s a story for another post. 

We’ve done some research ourselves as well regarding temporary relocation and what to do regarding termite infestation. We found that our landlord is to pay for temporary relocation assistance to the tenants, including the higher rent at the temporary location or hotel costs, moving and packing all personal property, costs of moving machinery or equipment, etc. 

So far our landlord is still waiting to hear back from their insurance company and has repeatedly urged us to start packing to move out due to a concern over our safety. They want us to move out EVERYTHING and has said that we can come back after the process IF WE WANT. To that, we proposed that they give us our deposit, a month of rent, and reimbursement to hire movers to move permanently into a different place. Like I mentioned, we are young females (one still in high school) and one of us have a fractured finger so moving furniture and other heavy items will not be easy. Our landlords keep coming at us saying the termites were a shock to them and they didn’t wish for this to happen and that expenses are heavy on them as is. They explained that they had to take out a loan to do construction on the rental property and even had a recent car accident and had been nice to us by immediately getting an exterminator to check the house. Btw, they have multiple rental properties and have been landlords for a long time (according to them). I think they’re trying to make us feel guilty and just move out permanently. 

We, as tenants, gave them two options. 1) we move out permanently but they cover movers, deposit, and one month rent. 2) they provide us temporary relocation assistance either to a hotel or Airbnb and cover movers+storage fee because they require us to move everything out for fumigation and construction. Is this too much to ask for?because finding a new place in a certain neighborhood is not easy and it’s stressful for us too. As much as we would love to move out because as our landlord said, “who would want to live in a house with termites,” we’re having difficulty asking for any sort of compensation. They think we don’t want to move out and that we want to risk our safety over proper compensation.

So, what should we do here? Are we asking for too much? Are we in the right to ask for the required compensation or did we misinterpret the California housing codes wrong :|",SnooDoubts3824,10,0,0.38

The missed payment was $78, which was the monthly payment. They've been charging me $28.90 in monthly late fees ever since, and now the balance I owe is $395. I suppose I'll just pay it off now before it gets even worse. My experience has always been that if I didn't pay an account, at most, the debt would double, not go up times 5. It doesn't seem fair.

263,"Small claims lawsuit: Apartment exaggerated damages, created bogus receipt items, pulled from my credit card without authorization",11v5jxw,"2 months after my lease had ended, the apartment just directly charged my credit card bogus charges (fake or no receipt items) without my signatures nor acknowledgment. Due to the unauthorized draft of money from my credit card, I checked my other bank statements and realized there are also other duplicated charges. Out of all the money charged, I was only supposed to pay ~$200 (my $99 deposit went into paying a part of this) which I authorized. So the extra charges wrongfully billed is fraud, violation of implied contract, and taking of personal property. 

Within that bogus amount, $770 for bogus holes (77 holes). I had fixed all the holes visible to me upon move out. I'm sure there were NOT 77 holes, and the staff who did the move out inspection confirmed verbally. 

**QUESTION 1:**

Which, if any or if any combination, of these reasons is better in my defense?

1. I had fixed all the holes visible to me (proof of maintenance requests) and there are definitely not 77 holes.
2. Do not mention the holes and just emphasize that the walls did not have any visible damages (proof of panoramic images I took when advertising for lease takeover).

**QUESTION 2:**

Would apartment companies think this money is worth their time, or will they just mediate so I will settle for some of that $1100? 



**QUESTION 3:**

The online portal which they use to collect payment for rent and utilities have 2 methods of payments. 1 way is to save the payment method for future payment (but I did not have to sign an autopay agreement), and another way is to manually click the pay ""button"". So technically, I did not sign anything authorizing them to pay nor click any button to pay.

Considering it’s ambiguous whether using their online paying system means giving authorization, what wrongdoings are their actions still considered of? 

**QUESTION 4:**

How should I argue for unauthorized charges that encompassed some authorized amount?

------
Timeline:

- Beg of March 2020 (20 days after moving out) They sent me a 2nd move out bill which included charges more than the 1st move out bill (verbally mutually agreed on the 1st move out bill during move out inspection).
- Beg of April 2020 I never signed the 2nd move out bill, but bank directly pulled from my credit card which was previously stored in their payment portal $370
- End of April 2020 I told my credit card company to block further charges.
- Beg of May 2020 got 2nd charge of $770, told my credit card company it's the same charge but for different amount and asked them to reverse it.
- Aug 2020 I realized that my credit card company didn't do anything about the charges, and appealed and since have not heard back. I assume it's because they assumed that I authorized the entire amount.

------
p.s. This is almost 3 years ago and the staff of the apartment (whom I interacted with) I'm suing have already left. I noticed before and notified my bank during COVID peak when this happened. They told me to work it out with the recipient of the money, but the recipient ignored me. I also got sick so I was only recently able to circle back to this problem. I am indeed trying to defend myself which is why I am desperate for help right now. I have not encountered something like this before. According to https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=4.16.080, the statute of limitation for fraud and expressed contracts is limited to 3 years in the state of Washington where this incident took place. This means I have only have till end of this month.

His lawyer sent an affidavit to my insurance company to fill out to declare I wasn't on work duty at the time of accident and that I don't have any other liability coverage, and they're also asking me to give them a list of my assets and liabilities. In the documents, it states that completing the assets affidavit is not a condition to settle the claim, but will ""release your insured by release or otherwise"" (idk what this means).

270,Transferring Car Title,11v50tx,"Hi,

I live in Michigan, US.

About 8 months ago I had my mother sign away her car title to me. Everything was set and I believe all I had to do was go to the SOS office and boom I would have ownership of the car. It was a gift to some degree, but there was a money transfer for the car that was not documented. Of course with my jam-packed busy schedule, I never got around to it and it got lost. Me and my wife have turned our house upside down for the last month trying to find it to no avail. My mom's license plate sticker is expiring next month and I can not update it due to me not having ownership of the car, at least to my knowledge that is how it works. Regardless I can not sell the car without the title, obviously, if I wished to in the future. The car is not registered to my address either. I do insure the car under my address, which she does not pay for. Also, if she wanted to, I believe she could take the car at anytime.

 This would all be an easy fix to replace the title but we are not on speaking terms. IF I could get her to help me out and not screw me over, how would I do it? I have done some research, could she appoint me as her agent to sign off for her to replace the title? It would be in her name still, but then we could go through the process of signing it off to me like it was done prior, correct?

I would like to include her as little as possible so any information would be helpful, thank you!",MetallicMatte,1,1,1.0

Okay so I've come to this subreddit before for advice and found it fairly helpful. I'm not sure if this is better for here or the off-topic subreddit but I'm trying here first just in case.  
So for a little bit of background, this case has been ongoing for about four years now. The first year or so my lawyers and victim advocate were really on top of stuff. I had a lot of frequent updates and they seemed to take care of a lot. Once COVID hit a lot of it came to a grinding halt which I expected to a degree, but the past year I've had to do a lot for them and they've lost a lot of my emails, my partner's emails, and had me to try and get a lot of info for them that I legit could not get to.

The more frustrating thing is how often they need to push deadlines or I'm left in the dark for months while expecting something. This is the most recent example but the most frustrating: I was told in November via my VA that they'd be discussing a settlement for my case and it should take a few weeks. I contacted them in January and was told I would hear something in February.   
I heard nothing about a week into February so I contacted them again because I had been having issues getting messages and was worried something didn't go through. Was told there were no updates but I'd hear something about the next steps in mid-February. I actually don't hear anything until the last day of February. Which was good, I got a confirmation of my settlement number and that I would be receiving some final documents to sign and a call to get my bank information and go over the numbers. Someone did call on time and they did get my information, but it's been nearly three weeks and no documents. I got an email yesterday saying that there had been a 'mild delay' in the lawyers looking over the documents and they should be sent in about two weeks. I asked my VA what was happening and she said she doesn't have the details but there was some wording in the contract that made the lawyers uncomfortable and they're revising it over these next two weeks.

Is this normal? Like the wait times. I tried to look up this place for reviews and there aren't a lot out there (maybe ten at most), most are positive but I did find one negative review that explained they weren't worth it. I've never done this before and my dad was the one who set me up with this place.

If my partner and I hadn't been able to move in immediately afterwards, along with another friend, Dwould have been left with the difference in rent, about $2000. We spoke to Emily before, during, and after the move and since we were taking over her part of the lease, she agreed we could pay her back for her part of the security deposit over time instead of all at once because of the fees we ate to manage it.

280,Is it possible to have a non-convicted assault charge removed from a background check? (WA state),11v314h,"Back in 2016, a month after turning 18 years old, I was arrested on an assault charge. My mother was physically and emotionally abusive all my life. I’ve been punched in the face, thrown to the floor, shoved down the stairs, and shoved out of a moving car. After turning 18, she started charging me hundreds of dollars in rent. Since she wanted to treat me like a tenant, I informed her that I was no longer interested in being bossed around by her. If she wants to treat me like an adult by charging me rent, she didn’t have the right to boss me around to do her bidding. 

She came into my room one day, demanding that I help her fix her iPad. I said no and told her I was busy. She screamed at me telling me that I was disrespectful, and started pulling out large gallon sized trash bags and throwing all of my belongings in it. I yelled at her to stop, but she continued on. I’m a female and only weighed 80 lbs back then, whereas my mom weighed about 130. I snatched the trash bag full of my stuff out of her hands. I had long nails at the time so they grazed her as I was snatching the bag. She shouted that I assaulted her and said she was calling the police. 

When the police came, I told them what had happened. They asked my mom if she wanted me arrested and she said yes. As I was getting handcuffed, she said she’d change her mind about me being arrested if I apologized. The officers told her that’s not how it works and took me to county jail. I was booked for the night and released the next morning since my mom dropped the charges. I believe the charge was considered as a non-convicted misdemeanor. 

Shortly after that incident, my boyfriend at the time took me in and I never spoke to my mom again. 3 years after the incident, I had submitted a request with the Washington State Patrol to have the misdemeanor deleted. My request was approved and granted. 

However, the arrest still appears on my background check. I’ve been unable to signup to do delivery jobs such as Postmates, Instacart, and UberEats. Even though it has been 7 years since the incident took place and I’ve had no trouble with the law since, I’m still denied delivery jobs because of it. I thought that having it deleted from the Washington State Patrol database would be enough, but I guess I’m not understanding where information is pulled for background checks. 

Is there any possible way for this to be removed or sealed? It feels horrible that I’m seen as a risk, all because I wanted to standup to my abusive mother for once.

281,Damage to property that requires me to fix my damage before the damager fixes theirs?????,11v2yf2,"True scenario: The City installs a sidewalk that requires its contractors to cut everyone’s in-ground sprinkler lines. The City says it will repair the damages by caping off the exposed ends of the lines with new sprinkler heads. 

So far, so good, right?

The issue: When the City contractors show up at my door to fix my lines, they tell me they need to turn on my sprinkler system so they can locate all the cut lines they buried and to see if it is working properly with no leaks. 

I inform them that the system is inoperable, and has been since. Moved in two years ago. When the previous owners installed a swimming pool, they did not pay to have the sprinkler system redone properly, so they just shut it down and left it with problems such as a main timer box that is long dead and won’t power up, a huge leak that is coming from underneath the pool equipment, old and damaged back-flow preventer, a main valve that we can’t locate and that I suspect was probably destroyed when the pool equipment was added (probably why there’s a huge leak), etc. 

The contractors insist that I need to fix all of those issues in order for them to fix the damage they caused, and their subcontractor is saying that I can pay him to fix my part of the damage so that he can then fix the city’s damage at their expense. 

I did not plan on sinking hundreds of dollars into this right now, but if I don’t, the city isn’t going to repair their damages. 

Are they correct that I have to spend my own money for damage they didn’t cause  so they can fix the damage they did cause?

I have a legal advice question regarding my situation. I am a Section 8 client who applied for an apartment in LA back in December 2022. The unit was supposed to be ready on January 13th, but there have been issues with the inspection and leasing process. Section 8 inspectors reached out to the leasing office to schedule an inspection appointment, but there was a miscommunication about the inspection date (the leasing office claimed the unit was inspected by Section 8 when it was not).

I later found out the leasing office informed me that the original unit I had applied for was no longer available due to the current tenant deciding to stay, despite my legal holding deposit on the unit. They offered me another unit, which I agreed to, but it failed the Section 8 inspection due to needing necessary repairs (despite the leasing office telling me prior to agreeing that it was ready for inspection).

286,Do I have a case as a nurse?,11ve0nh,"I am copy and pasting what happened to me tonight. After you read them, understand that I work for a staffing agency. This facility that I had signed up for contacted the agency in hopes of having me reported evidently so they could jeopardize my license saying I abandoned my patients. That's not the case  though. I refused to count with them and take the keys to the cart because I would not be put in a situation to be responsible for 50 people. Do I have any valid reason that I can sue them? We as nurses have been taken advantage of for way too long (long hours, no breaks, understaffed) and I refuse to jeopardize my license and my patients lives by working extremely understaffed. I just need advice. If no one ever takes a stand against these facilities they are going to continue these practices. I am in GA. Thank you! Any advice on how to proceed is very appreciated. 

Below is a copy the messages:

Staffing Agency***Hello. C---- Health says you walked out during your shift. Are you still there?

Me*****I spoke with On-Call and told them the situation and I would not count with them until I knew what was going on. I was going to have right at 50 patients on my own the whole shift where as there is supposed to be a 7-11p nurse to get that night medicine out. That is too high of a patient to nurse ratio and it is illegal to expect me to do that. I will be reporting them to state tomorrow! I told them that I would not stay if there was no one there to do that part. On call documented it. I drove 45 minutes there and was there until 745 and didn't get a time sheet filled out. I am very upset with this! I will never return to that facility again. I will not risk my nursing license or my patients safety because they don't have management that will come in and do what they are supposed to do if they don't have proper coverage. So yes. I did leave. I refused to count and would not take keys and be responsible for them. I've been a nurse for 20 years and know for a fact that is illegal.

Staffing Agency****The facility stated you did not stay long enough to find out. 
We wish you would not have left though. We would have helped look for staff as well.

Me*****I spoke with on call and it was already 745. The day shift nurse was still passing medicine on the cart that I was supposed to have. I stayed long enough to know that there would not be another nurse there for hours if they did get someone and I refuse to be responsible for that many patients. I have never in my life experienced this kind of situation and I will report them. I have worked many years in management and know they have on call rotation and whomever was on call should have been there at 7p to take that cart until they had someone. 
I'm very sorry. This is not my nature but I know that I can't take care of 50 people at once. There are many scenarios that could happen with multiple patients at the same time and if someone lost their life because I couldn't get to them then I would be held responsible for that. I've been a nurse long enough to know that these situations do happen.
You can go ahead and cancel the remaining shifts I am signed up for because I will not step foot back in that facility. Thank you 

Staffing Agency****Ok thank you for letting us know

Me*****You're welcome
Will I get any compensation at all or not? 

Staffing Agency****I will have your recruiter follow up with you on Monday

Me*****There shall be sufficient nursing staff on duty at all times to provide care for each patient according to his needs. A minimum of 2.0 hours of direct nursing care per patient in a 24-hour period must be provided. 
Wanted to send you this. When you calculate the hours divided between 7a-7p and 7p to 7a nurse, you are legally not supposed to have more than 24 patients. This is Rules and Regulations for the State of GA

I admitted fault to my insurance (progressive) and they said they’d take of it. I even brought up what she told me about the furniture and the rep said he’d ask her about it and they’d investigate and pay if there was any damage. so that was that, progressive was taking care of it. 

recently checked the claim status and it says they’re paying for their back truck door by giving them a check and the case is now closed. today, i’ve received 8 missed calls from this lady. 8!!!!

I had taken a nap and put my phone on do not disturb. She keeps calling and calling but not leaving any sort of voicemail or even a text. which we had texted at the time of the accident to switch insurances so not sure why she can’t text me what she wants. I have a feeling it’s something with her furniture which not sure why she didn’t include it in the claim. 

i’m basically here to ask, do I need to keep in contact with her? do I have to answer her call? I could block her but she has my address. I live with my mom and if she goes and i’m not home, my mom would most likely answer the door. she keeps calling and calling and it’s stressing me out.


edit: turns out she did submit the furniture as part of the claim but i’m guessing they denied it, not sure why but i’m guessing because there was no damage. is it legal for her to go after me go pay for it since insurance denied it? can she go to my house to ask for money?",honeybvbymom,4,1,0.67

I bought a course from a online guru.

I have recently been working a new job and have been going through a lot of mental problems, I was scrolling through Instagram and saw somebody promoting some sort of course. what they were promoting doesn't really matter. 

""Get rich quick"" kinda course. Except for it was a business model that I was super familiar with and thought I could get it to work. 

I seem interested so I hop on a call with one of the closers, they tell me everything and tell me it's going to change my life, and they get me to agree to pay 900 a month for a Facebook group (up to 10k then payments stop) 

Well, I was in the group for 3 months and it wasn't anything that it seemed to be. regardless, I had agreed to pay verbally and was on their stripe payments getting charged every single month. 

I wanted to cancel but this was a recurring charge. I know. It's my fault for agreeing. I know. 

I had already agreed, they sent me a contract to sign stating I would pay the full 10k, but I never signed it and they kept telling me to but I never did. 

I ended up canceled my credit card and now I don't pay any more. they are emailing me saying that they can sue me, will I still be able to get sued if I never signed the legal agreement?

Tldr: I verbally agreed to pay a GURU $900 a month, they sent me a contract   for me to agree, I didn't sign it, ended up cancelling my card, now I don't pay the $900 anymore, they sent an email saying they can sue, however in the email it says  ""you signed a legal contract"" which I never did.

In under 24 hours, I was approved and was immediately sent a lease to sign (had an expiration of 24 hours). After reading the lease, I found I would be responsible for a few things that were not disclosed to me prior to applying, which were deal breakers. I went back and re-read the application to make sure they were not mentioned there (they weren't), but did come across this clause (which I overlooked, and initialed):

> I acknowledge and agree that the first month's rent is freely given to the owner and/or owner's agent in consideration of the owner's act of removing the premises from the real estate rental market in reliance on this application to lease, after the application has been approved. Therefore, I agree that if I fail or refuse, for any reason whatsoever to follow through with the Lease Terms of the above-described property, I understand and agree that the owner will retain the full amount of the first month's rent ($XXXX) as liquidated damages, which I freely acknowledge is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable expectation of damages which owner incurred as a result of temporarily removing the premises from the real estate rental market and attempting to find another party to lease the premises.

Am I reading this right? That the landlord can charge me the equivalent of first month's rent for simply refusing to sign the lease?

298,"Divorce, Custody, and Child Support Aid",11v0t6p,"Hi,

So I'm currently going through a divorce (26M) in Illinois with one child (2F).

This whole process has been hard as my ex-wife filed an OP against me to keep me away from my daughter as a power move. She used this time to steal all of my cash, a joint tax return, and racked up all utilities that were in my name. I was a stay-at-home dad (in charge of all four of her kids and her sister's 3 year old) and a full time student when she kicked me out of the house, so I was homeless, unemployed, and in massive debt with no funds.

It took about four months before I got the OP dismissed, at which point her lawyer quit halfway through a court date after reviewing all the evidence I had proving she was full of shit.

At which point, I negotiated 50% visitation, joint custody, and we split all medical, education, and extracurricular bills. We even split the child tax credit.

Now in a couple of weeks, we have financial court... I am coming after her for $16,000 (her half of debt that I was straddled with, half the tax return she ran off with, and equity in the house we bought). She countered and asked for child support.

This is where I need advice... She claimed she made $53,000 (I make $58,000) and my lawyer was under the impression I'd pay max $40/mo...

Except here's the problem, she about her income so she only made $17.50/hour working 40 hours a week. So my child support obligation goes up. Then I found out yesterday she either quit or was fired from her job, and I'm worried about what that'll do to my child support obligation.

I can barely make ends meet right now as I'm paying for my bills, my daughters insurance, marital debt, and lawyer debt. I make too much for state assistance (she claims me and three of her kids for LINK), and her house payment is 2/3rds of my rent.

When I do the calculator with her making no money, it says I'll owe around $600 and I don't know what to do. This woman has destroyed every ounce of my being, ripped me away from my child, left me in the streets with nothing, and I'm freaking the fuck out.",EmperorValEmbershade,4,1,0.67

Property management doesn't respond to emails but when I called last week they said they'd send one out.

If they can enforce that by keeping my security deposit or something, I'd actually sent my 60-day notice 2 weeks ago by email - again, crickets, no response or anything, but in one phone call they said that was how to provide notice.

The work included removing popcorn ceilings, installing hardwood floors throughout (1700 sq ft), and renovating the kitchen (new cabinetry, backsplash, lighting). There were LOTS of problems during the work and it was never really up to standards when they finally “finished.” One of the biggest points of contention was that the contract I signed specified that the hardwood floors would be installed with a floor glue, and it became clear they had not glued the flooring when it was installed. At the time we finished, they assured me that there were two methods for installation and that my flooring was properly installed. I had posted a negative review publicly during the time they were working because I had been unable to even reach them to get them to come finish the work. They basically came back an extorted me, saying that somehow I owed them $3000 and they would collect it if I didn’t remove my review and sign an agreement not to talk about this company. I was so beaten down at that point that I did it and tried to just move on.

My question is am I entitled to a full refund please? I paid the £700 late yesterday evening and pulled out this morning.
I would really appreciate any help because I can’t afford this place now and need the £700 back as I don’t have a job now either. Many thanks",Lucky-Window-2791,2,0,0.25
317,Kitchen Remodeling Issues- How to go About This?,11uxwg6," 

If there is somewhere else I should ask, please redirect.

In early October, we signed a contract with a kitchen renovation company with a deposit give totaling half the total cost of renovations. Six weeks later, final measurements were taken, materials were picked, and we were advised we’d get a call regarding a start date. With the holiday season in full swing at that time, we didn’t hear from anyone. We weren’t concerned at this point because again, it was the holidays and we live in an area where literally everything seems to be slower during the holidays. I mean, urgent care facilities were even closed for weeks.

On January 2nd, I reached out to the employee who we signed the contract with and he informed me the scheduler would get in touch with me. She did, and promised a start date would be provided by 1/6. I didn’t hear from here and reached out the following Tuesday, 1/10. At first I had sent her a text, then I called the office (kept ringing, no VM option) and then I emailed our initial contact again; this is when I received a text from the scheduler stating she was home sick with her child and that they were short staffed but she promised to get me a date by the end of the week, 1/13.

I am a mom of an often sick toddler so I sympathized, sent well wishes and went about my day. I did not hear from her on 1/13 and decided to reach out again on 1/16. I called the office to no avail. I text the scheduler again to which I was informed that they had Covid but are currently on the mend and that she PROMISED we’d have a start date by close of business that day, 1/16. After almost another week of going back and forth via email, we were given a new start date of March 6th, which was a month and a half after our initial start date of mid-January, which we were given verbally.

On February 17th, we reached out again this time regarding a question about the installation of our new stove. The did not answer the email until ten days later, which required me following up with them twice. They sent someone out on March 1st to assess and final plans on the stove and cabinet height were made. We asked once again for confirmation on the 3/6 start date, to which we were told that, unfortunately due to being short staffed and work on a prior project not being completed, that our kitchen work would not start on 3/14. 

On Monday, 3/13, I had emailed the point of contact asking for a start time. She emailed me back a screen shot of an email she had sent me on Sunday, 3/12. Shockingly, this had gone to spam despite how much we had been communicating. The email informed us of the same thing we have been hearing: they are short staffed, the previous project is taking too long and we have to push **our** start date back **again.** The same email stated that she was to send us an update on 3/13, which she never did. We responded and expressed our extreme disappointment is their lack of follow-up, in the fact that it's always us reaching out to them, and stressed that we have several other home renovation projects that are being held up due to this. We did not ask for our money back, but instead maybe some money off the project considering what a nightmare this has been. 

As of this writing, we have not heard back from them and truthfully, I know we won't unless we reach out to them again. What should we do here? To add, I'm pregnant with several complications already happening, and I truly do not need the added stress. Further, I would love to have this sort of work done before the baby gets here. I know this was long but I really didn't want to leave anything out; what advice can anyone offer, please?",mamaaaaagf,0,1,0.67

319,"Were you ""charged"" with a ""felony"" if the charge was remanded down to a misdemeanor in court?",11uxi3z,"LOCATION: New Jersey (Felonies = Degree 1-4, Misdemeanor = Disorderly Persons)

For reference, most employers ask for convictions but I aspire to work in high financial services where ""charges"" are inquired about through [FINRA](https://www.finra.org/#/).

I am a university student who was arrested and ""charged"" with a felony at first by the university police. Without my attorney doing anything at all, the charge was immediately remanded down to the municipal court as a disorderly person charge. My question relates more to the legal language. 

I understand I need to contact a lawyer who specializes in the securities industry and FINRA arbitrations in the future but on a lawyer's website, it says depending on the state an officer's charge is not the same as what the prosecutor brings upon you in court officially. 

What you are read in court / the prosecutor brings upon you in court is your ""official"" and formal charge. So if asked if I have been ""charged"" with a felony, would I answer yes or no?  I personally believe I would answer **no**. This is because while the arresting officer's summons claims it is a 4th-degree charge (felony), the prosecutor immediately remanded it down to a disorderly person charge meaning I was formally charged with a misdemeanor. Did anyone get advice or outlook? Not looking for a concrete answer as this is just a subreddit and I know I should and must contact an attorney about this, but more so looking for general advice and some opinions before I do so.

320,"Won a disability discrimination suit, bank said settlement check was fraudulent. Can’t get ahold of attorney.",11tspgl,"Edit: I am in Connecticut 

Hello,

**June 2020:**
Back in 2020 I was wrongfully terminated due to a disability.  If more info is necessary on that part I will provide but I don’t think it’s relevant to my problem.


I got a lawyer and over the following year I filed suit. 

**September 2022:**
Fast forward to September 2022 the first settlement hearing was finally scheduled and to my happiness my attorney and I were able to negotiate a settlement offer that I felt was fair and would go a long way to help rebuild my life as a combination of unemployment, the disability itself and COVID I essentially lost everything.  No house, no working car, etc.  

**November 2022:**
I received 2 settlement checks in November 2022.  They split the settlement I guess for tax purposes I don’t fully understand it.  

I deposited the two checks into my credit Union who claimed the checks were fraudulent and ejected the money from my account.  I called my lawyer and he said his check (issued from the same entity and bank) for my lawyers fees cleared just fine and he would contact the bank and the banking commission. I also gave him the direct contact info for my bank manager whom I spoke to about the issue before I called my attorney. 

**February 2023:**
My attorney calls me and says defense council says the checks were cashed.  I reiterate the checks were technically cashed but I never had access to the funds and 3 days later the money was removed from my account.  Bank manager & statement say fraudulent.  Sent attorney my bank statements.

Attorney says again he will contact bank and banking commission (as if he completely forgot he was supposed to do that 3 months prior) 

**March 2023:**
I receive a 1099 from the defendant for my tax filings.  I did not receive the W2.  I’m about to email my attorney that I don’t know what to do or how I’m supposed to pay taxes on income I still don’t have when attorney emails me asking for copies of the paperwork.  

I send him the 1099 and also say I never got the W2, explain my concerns about taxes and ask him to call me. 

3 days later I get another letter this time from social security.

In the time I was waiting for this settlement I had also applied for benefits because my disability got worse.  I was approved and at the time the letter said they’d re evaluate me in 3 years.  (Of course I would report the settlement income when I got it)

This new letter says they made an appointment to re evaluate me at the end of this month.  I freak out, until I get the settlement money disability is all I have and it’s not enough to begin with.  I’m concerned that social security got wind of the entities tax filings which likely include their payment to me and social security now thinks I have asserts that I didn’t report (which I do not have)

I call my attorney again but can’t get him on the phone.  I explain everything to his paralegal and she runs to him in the hall (he’s on his way to a hearing apparently).  He asks for a copy of the letter from social security and asks if I ever responded to his email about the tax forms.  (I had responded 3 days prior almost instantly). I emailed the letter and forwarded the whole chain to his paralegal just in case.

**Today:**
I called the office because I still haven’t gotten a call or an email response.  He’s unavailable.  I ask to tell him to call my today when he gets a chance.

The appointment with social security is getting closer, so is when my taxes are due. I still don’t have the money I’m owed and I have no idea where it even is.  Trying to get ahold of my lawyer is like pulling teeth and from my view knowing nothing about what he’s doing or progress in figuring this out leaves me feeling like nothing is being done and I’m left with nothing after I won the damn case.  

I’m also concerned about the meeting with social security because I don’t know what I can even tell them as part of the settlement agreement was me signing an NDA.

What the hell do I do?

**Update:**
There’s some other useful info in comments I’ve responded to but also, after a bunch of runaround I was able to get my attorney on the phone and now he wants to file suit against the bank.",Struggleaintshit,31,195,0.95
321,TN: Can Kroger be held liable for vehicle damage for a poorly built and placed curb over 1ft tall that appears to be hit alot?,11ve6dt,"Tennessee, My wife made a mistake, but I question the construction of a newly installed curb and the heavy amount of marks that indicate we may not be the only ones who have hit this curb. The Kroger has a Rx drive through. And for 10 years you pulled straight out. They recently renovated and this entire area is new. Instead of coming straight out, you have to turn and merge into a passby lane before leaving the drive-through.

324,How can we report this crime?,11uwtha,"Title is vague because I have no idea how to summarize this. Please do not crosspost this anywhere. I really, really do not want this to end up on TikTok or on one of those Instagram pages. It could have serious ramifications if this blows up and “Corey” finds this post. l am going to keep things as vague as possible to prevent any chance at identification. Names are fake. This is not a joke or bait post. Please help. 

This story involves my friend Anna, my friend Beatrice, and Anna’s ex boyfriend, Corey. The crime took place in New York state.

Anna and Corey dated for many years before the incident I’m about to mention. Corey confessed to Anna that he had committed a sex crime against a family member, who is a minor and lives in his household. He admitted that his parents knew of the crime and were protecting him. Anna broke it off with him and told Beatrice, who in turn told me. Since this incident, Corey has continued to harass both Anna and Beatrice, as Beatrice is the person to whom Anna is closest. Despite them blocking him on all socials, he has made alternative accounts to continue to harass them, and he has also reached out to many of Anna’s loved ones in an attempt to get Anna to contact him again. 

We have no proof that Corey committed this crime other than text messages in which he references it. It is Anna’s word against his, and his own parents, who DO have the evidence, are attempting to keep this hush hush. We are afraid that if the child stays in the family’s care that he will continue to abuse her. How do we report this? To whom do we report it? Can Anna get a restraining order if need be? We are afraid of him. He is physically much larger than any of us, and he has been cruel to Anna in the past. This is serious, and ongoing. It could mean life or death for the people involved because this guy is literally unhinged.

I bought my first home back in June 2021. The person who sold the house to me owned it from 2013 through 2021. One thing that was mentioned on the seller's disclosure was that the PREVIOUS owner (prior to 2013) had disclosed that there was some termite damage in the basement.

Before I bought the house, this was the one thing that made me almost back out. It wasn't until after having an inspector come and a licensed pest control company come to confirm that:

1. There was only one termite shelter tube.
2. There was slight damage to one piece of wood under the basement stairs.
3. There was no other signs of damage anywhere in the basement or throughout the house.
4. There were no signs of an active infestation.

With this all in mind, I went through and purchased the house.

I've been here almost two years and no issues on this front. This termite damage could have been from 10/20/30/40 years ago. My question is that when I'm ready to sell my house, do I need to continue the chain of disclosures? I don't want to hurt my chances of finding a buyer over this non-issue.

327,Can this be a case for seeking unpaid wages?,11uwe1z,"Located in NYC (first time poster on behalf of my partner).

 My partner's family had formerly operated a family restaurant business (LLC) with a family friend who was a co-owner, while my partner and his mom were regular employees (did not have their names tied to the LLC).

The restaurant had a crappy location and only survived from September 2022 to December 2022. Suffice to say the one co owner was not happy with how slow the business was becoming, so he closed the doors and my partner and his mother were jobless. 

I don't believe that my partner can claim unemployment due to having only worked for 3 months and had not maintained continuous employment for the last 18 months (the last jobs he had was where he left voluntarily and he has gaps in employment the last 18 months). 

He has also discussed with his mother about attempting to collect unpaid wages from the co owner. There are a few things to note:

-the business did not have a lot or enough money to pay him or his mom due to breaking even and not having enough profits
-there was no W2 or paystub/payroll established. Anything that was earned went back into the restaurant. The only money my partner and his mom could bring home was from the tip jar, which the co owner would try to claim as his own despite not being a regular employee. 
-his mom and him did not have employment contracts, only received verbal agreements on a starting wage of 15/hour (NYS minimum wage) and a few text message exchanges. 

From the three months time in which the business was operating he worked around 50-60 hours per week. While they didn't have a proper time clock he was told to write down his hours and give them to the owner every week. He has reached out to the co owner asking about getting paid for his time worked but the co owner said he wasn't responsible for paying the money, and that my partner needed to speak to his dad about it, even though his dad no longer is tied to the LLC. He has tried to speak to the co owner again on the issue but the co owner so far isn't willing to speak further about the topic and has been avoiding him. 

Is my partner and his mom still able to seek out for those 3 months unpaid wages? They are looking to seek legal aid but aren't sure whether they able to file for an unpaid wages claim or have to sue the former co owner in small claims court. I'm unsure how much legal discourse the situation can have but any insight appreciated.",Constant_Assignment2,2,1,1.0
328,Store that ends with Land and sells Pets is keeping my $5k puppy from me that I’ve paid for,11v83bx,"I met a healthy puppy on March 5, took a couple days to think about it. Did not like the idea of purchasing from this store but I fell head over heels for the puppy and decided to go ahead and pay an outrageous $5k for it. It isn’t the puppy’s fault where he ended up yet. Anyways, after a couple days my partner and I decided to go through with purchasing the puppy. I texted the sales rep and told her we want to take it home and she informed me that he had “sniffles” and he will be cleared by a vet in a couple days. This was March 9th. She put the pressure on to pay for it and sign paperwork that day so “no one else will be able to buy the puppy.” Part of that does say “no returns.” But I paid and signed for a puppy that wasn’t able to leave that day. March 9th was Thursday, she said it should be Tuesday, maybe Wednesday when it will be able to go home. Since I swiped my card, communication has ceased. I texted first on Monday to ask if he could still go home the next day. Then I’m told it will be Friday, March 17. I text first Thursday, the 16th, to confirm. Now he won’t be ready till the next Tuesday or Wednesday. I say I can give the puppy medicine, I’m just ready for him to be home and get him settled. Asked the rep to please discuss with her manager and the vet. Manager calls me, says it’s the vet not releasing the puppy. Call the vet and have the most unprofessional conversation and he tells me I shouldn’t have bought a sick puppy and the store is the owner as far as he is concerned. I say I literally have the receipt, I can email it over. Vet says no. I call the manager back and they tell me no returns. I say I don’t have the puppy and y’all can’t tell me where he is. Gives me a number to call for a refund. That number is a third party and buckled down on the now returns. If I don’t get my dog by March 22nd, I want to to take action. 

What are my options? I recorded the phone calls and have the texts I’ve made regarding the situation. Also I’m in Texas. Any help appreciated.

329,[VT] Neighbor had some logging done on his land. Logging company completely destroyed the private road running through our land.,11u597p,"Last year, my wife and I bought a parcel of forested land. The parcel contains a road running through the center. This road is a right-of-way easement for a neighboring parcel.

Up until recently, the road was in excellent shape. The neighbor had actually put quite a bit of work and effort into graveling and maintaining it. At some point in the last few weeks, the neighbor had some logging done on his land, and the logging company appears to have completely destroyed the road. It's impassable by anything other than a tractor. Not only that, but the logging company destroyed the railing of a wooden bridge that crosses a river at the edge of our land (the bridge is owned/maintained by the town).

We've been coordinating with several contractors to begin work on a home site on our land, and this road is/was the only way to access the site. It is now completely impassable, and the one contractor who has seen it confirmed that no work can be done while the road is in this condition.

I very briefly spoke with the owner of the neighboring parcel. From what I could gather, he is displeased with the mess the logging company made, but he doesn't seem especially concerned about it.

I unfortunately did not remember to get the logging company's contact information, but I feel like that's a likely next step.

My primary reason for posting here is that I feel like I don't know where I stand with regard to my rights and responsibilities. The road runs through our land, but it's a shared easement. Does the logging company carry the ultimate responsibility for returning the road to its former condition? Does our neighbor? Do *we*? Where should I go from here?

Edit: I think this just became a much bigger deal, and has crossed over into this subreddit's favorite topic: tree law.

335,(WA State) Peculiar rental situation,11uvarw,"So first off, I am contacting the tenant’s union Monday morning.
But I need some questions answered asap.
Here is the situation:
I was fired from my job back in November, and haven’t found one yet. I’m subsisting on what meager revenue I can access through doing Door Dash by foot (my car was repossessed in December, and my e bike was stolen while dashing in February). I was late on rent, and while dashing to get it, I was in a hit and run as the victim.
Anyhow, my landlord was talking about eviction, and I still had another time of being late before he can even think about it.
Out of the frustration, I gave my 30 notice of intent to move. The landlord then offered to pay me to do work around the house so he can sell it, for which I’ve only been given $20. And there is approximately 40 hours of landscaping and exterior work that was done. He also offered to let me stay on, as I have nowhere to go since I can’t find work or get help from anybody.
To further complicate things, my roommate gave his notice as well, but he couldn’t find a new plant yet, so the landlord made him pay rent, without giving him any kind of lease.
The landlord had us move into the basement, so he could have the upstairs professionally cleaned. Now, they want to come in and take pictures. But he is trying to force my roommate to move his belongings. 
Nowhere in this has the landlord made an attempt to pay our deposits back, and it’s 6 weeks past the end of my tenancy. It’s 3 weeks for my roommate.
The home has a ton of unpermitted work, including a full remodel of the bathroom, including the changing of plumbing and electrical.
I’m pretty much screwed right now, as far as another place to go.

The way drinking water works in our restaurant is when you first get hired you are given a reusable, washable food, service style plastic cup (like those coke/Pepsi ones, only 12oz). You get to use it for unlimited tea, water, soda, (and a shake but only on lunches). 

What you usually aren’t told until the first time it happens is, if you forget to wash or put your cup in the dish pit at the end of the shift, your cup goes to “cup jail” and you have to pay $1 USD to get it back. If you don’t have the dollar sometimes your manager will have mercy on you and let you have your cup (you will end up paying the money the same day). If your cup stays in cup jail, you have to bring your own cup in, which can also be jailed if it is forgotten. 
In other words, it doesn’t even matter if you bring your own cup in it will still end up being confiscated if you accidentally forget your drink or cup. This severely upsets me because for weeks nobody told me my cup was in cup jail and I was *using a random fucking one with no name label that one of my coworkers was also using on days when I wasn’t there.* when I finally brought my own in my mom etched my name into *it was jailed. A sovereign cup, I tell you!!!*. I am MAD. So what is the solution? 

I had an energy drink today, and I ended up bringing in my own water during my lunch, because I literally had no cup to use, but then I went back to using the unlabeled cup again, because my can of sparkling water got tossed by someone and I got fussed at by the same coworker that keeps putting it in “cup jail” that I “need to pay a dollar to use it”. Excuse me? I had an 8 hour shift I can’t drink water during?  What? And she said “no you just need to bring a dollar!” WHAT???? I AM SO UNCLEAR ON HOW THIS IS LEGAL????

Edit:: I don’t think i was clear enough in the original post about this as well— I’ll paste from a comment “kinda assumed it was stealing though since they also do it with cups or bottles you bring in from home. Even if you’re not out of the building yet. As soon as you clock out it goes to “jail” and you have to pay for your own item back. It’s not just the water it’s the actual cup I’m also worried about.” You can bring your own cup not provided by them and have to pay to get it back.

It is also up to your manager’s discretion to let you get your cup temporarily to pay later or not. If you have any cups already in cup jail, they will not let you do it. You just have to do without. It doesn’t matter what is wrong or if you have medical issues. It doesn’t matter if you have UTI’s or kidney stones both of which I’ve seen my coworkers have and simply go without water.",ContractSouth5574,9,0,0.18

338,Do I have a cause for legal action if my former retirement plan refuses to issue a 1099-R for a rollover but did so for another former employee?,11uuwyc,"I left a job in 2022 and had to rollover my retirement money into a new account with my new employer. I have confirmed with the IRS that even though this is not a taxable event, it is a reportable event and should be disclosed on my tax return.

The plan administrator for the old retirement plan has been extremely uncooperative, and insists that a 1099-R is not necessary and refused to issue one. I have this in writing. I have already filed my taxes using IRS form 4852 (*Substitute for Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, or Form 1099R, Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRA's Insurance Contracts, Etc.*), but the return has not been approved.

I recently conferred with another former employee of my old employer who left the business and completed a rollover the same year as me, and learned this person was issued a 1099-R. They worked with an employee of the plan administrator who issued them the form within a day of request. I reached out this person and they said they would help, but have ghosted me for 3 weeks despite me following up. I can only assume they spoke to the plan administrator and were advised not to help me.

The IRS advised me to fill out and mail them a Form 3949-A to report alleged tax law violations by an individual or business. I recognize that I don't have specific damages save for this holding up approval of my tax return, especially as this all relates to a nontaxable event, but I'm mad and I want to know if there is anything else I can do. Does the fact that they complied with another ex-employee's request cause for a discrimination claim? If I need to contact a lawyer, what kind of lawyer should I be seeking?

341,Landlord withholding deposit in bad faith. TX,11uusiu,"Hi all. First time posting here, and on mobile.

I recently left Amarillo, TX and moved out of state. I had scheduled the walk through of my duplex for 9 am 2/21/23. At 9 that day, he was at my neighbor's (and his tennant in the house next door's) auto shop but was ""too busy"" to do my walk through. He knew I was leaving the state and happened to be busy the whole day. He told me he would call to discuss a few things, and never did. I contacted him a week later and requested all contact to be via rest or email for my records and requested for a copy of my lease and everything else I may have signed. A quick rundown of how it's gone

-landlord claims I owe him $500 dollars in addition to keeping my deposit for spraying for bedbugs last November. I was never informed I would be paying, how much it would be, never signed any documentation (not even in a lease).

-landlord has sent me pictures of a dusty vent, a dusty ceiling fan, dirty grout in the shower, and a maybe 1"" long 1/8"" tall spot on the corner of trim that is missing paint.  I have pointed out several times that cleaning items do not count against a deposit

-landlord has sent me a picture of a cat I had babysat temporarily. He says I broke the lease, as he had told me no cats. I never signed anything, nor did I know there were not cats allowed

Where it gets a bit iffy is I technically never signed a lease, at least not what I'm used to a lease being. I signed a paper that stated what my rent was, my security deposit, and that I had 2 dogs. Nothing less nothing more.

When I was calling the landlord after he was too busy for the 9am appointment, he did say he was raising my rent as of Feb 12 in an attempt to recoup the losses for the bedbug spraying, but I do not have that in writing.

I have already sent and have confirmation of receiving of my letter of demand

Do I need a lawyer? Suing for bad faith says they'll pay reasonable attorney fees, but I don't think small claims uses lawyers. Do I have a good case?(can send documentation in a message).

343,Need help regarding elder law,11uup02,"My neighbor, aged 80, recently moved to a senior living facility as a renter in assisted living.  She has her own apartment there.  She suffers with depression and anxiety but has her own therapist and psychiatrist which she has used for years.  After a disagreement with one of the workers at the facility, she made a flippant comment about jumping off a bridge and returned to her home.  

Then a police officer came to her home and convinced her to return to the assisted living facility.  I was with her at that time .  The officer was kind and just said that the facility was worried about her.  So she returned.  This was around March 5th.  

She called me today and said that the assisted living facility has placed her in a mental health institution.  Three cops were waiting for her and carted her off to the mental health institution.  
She called me to crying and related the above information to me.  The psychiatrist there is actually out of the country for 2 months and she has only had a couple meetings with him over Skype which she said lasted for only a minute.  The mental health facility has also accused her of having some sort of drug in her system.  Lord only knows she would have no idea where to obtain any illicit drugs.  She doesn’t even drink.  

The assisted living facility is keeping her dog at this time.  He is her emotional comfort pet and has special medical and dietary needs.  

I have reached out to an elder care attorney but it being Saturday, I doubt I will hear anything until Monday.  She said the mental health facility is limiting her visitors and any visitor must have a PIN.  She will give me the PIN on Monday.  

What are the chances an attorney can get her out of the mental health institution?   The poor thing is estranged from her 2 children and has no one to advocate for her.

346,My vehicle was dinged by a car door at Walmart.,11v4iv2,"I purchased a new 2022 Traverse about 8 months ago.  It currently has 7,800 miles on it.  While at a Walmart recently, my daughter and I went shopping and my wife stayed in the vehicle.  A few minutes later, my wife calls me and said someone pulled in next to us, flung open their door, and hit out vehicle.  I tell her to look for damage, take pictures, and get the plate number.  

A moment later, the people come out and my wife tries to talk to them.  Instead, they jump into their vehicle and speed away.  My daughter and I arrived shortly after.  I pulled up the dash camera footage(Viofo A129 Pro Duo 4k) and clearly see the impact.  I also took screenshots where you can clearly see the driver.

I go to my local police station and provide them with the video, screenshots, photos of the damage, photos of the damage to the other drivers door edge, and a photo of their license plate.  I ask if they could provide me with contact information for the person.  The officer says he’ll look into it and let me know.  

Two weeks later, I stop by requesting an update.  They said the officer created a private property crash report for it.  This was news to me because he said he wasn’t. He would just investigate and provide me with the contact info if he could verify it was her.  They gave me a copy of the report and it has both of our info on it as well as insurance.  

According to the local body shop, it’s about $480 in damage.  I was hoping not to have this on insurance.  $480 is $20 shy of my deductible.  I’m also worried how having a crash report for a door ding will depreciate the vehicle’s overall value.  

What’s my recourse here?  Should I file a claim against her insurance?  Attempt to work it out directly with her? Just forget about it all and swallow the damage cost?  The police clerk claimed that their report doesn’t get sent anywhere.  It’s just for their records.  Sorry if this isn’t the right sub to post about this.

349,i (27F) had a one night stand with someone who i later found out was in prison,11vdupu,"i am taking full responsibility for my actions but i do have questions. please help. 

Wednesday night, i got too drunk and was irresponsible. i had unprotected sex with someone i had only known for a few hours. he was not drunk, only i was. he ejaculated inside me without my consent and i had to take plan b. however, plan b does not work if you are already ovulating and of course, it's not always effective even when taken properly. 

again, i do take responsibility for my part in this but as i reflect i am becoming more and more concerned. he knew i was intoxicated but we still had sex. he finished inside me without that ever being agreed upon. 

the next morning, he told me he did not have a bank account and asked me to order him an uber to work. then later that day, he texted me to ask to see me again to ""order food and watch a movie at my place"" all in which he wanted me to pay for. his ride to my place, the food and his ride back from my house. i said no. at that point, i was even more repulsed by him and wanted to understand why the fuck he was so lost in life at his age. no car, no bank account (only cash), no drivers license, no HOME (he said he's one with nature and lives in a tent). he told me it was because he was in prison for a while and was trying to get his shit back in order. 

i tried not to judge his situation but it's like...what was he in prison for, i ask myself. he also revealed later that he was two kids who he obviously does not see. 

my question is, with his history being the way it is and his current mind set being how it is, is what he did sexually wrong? is ejaculating inside someone during sex without their consent wrong or am i being ""sensitive""? should i feel like i am to blame because i had sex with him while i was drunk?

363,Medical Malpractice / Fuddled healthcare turns injury into chronic illness.,11v2xuw,"I am wondering if anyone has any information or experience in medical malpractice lawsuits. I am interested in pursuing one and first wanted to check in here before trying to talk to lawyers by phone.

Initial injury: broken left acetabulum, non-displaced fracture. Treated for such, was on crutches when sent home from hospital

Unfound injuries from initial incident: six herniated discs in the upper thoracic, one herniated disc in the neck and multiple bulged discs in the thoracic and cervical spine. Even though I said that my back hurt the day I was in the emergency room, the doctor poked my back, and I didn’t exclaim enough for him so he did not check my back.

Issue: This was a whole body accident where I stated I hit my back, said it hurt, and complained about my back to multiple doctors and ers and they did not want to check it. They though my pain was just from my pelvic fracture. 

There were several incidences where acute pain in legs, back, abdomin, and everywhere sent me to the ER. Eventually parts of me started falling asleep, being excruciating, and having stinging nerve pain. 

This was all basically ignored by two hospitals and their affiliated doctors in the same region in a period of six months post injury. FINALLY, a doctor outside of this system thought to look at my upper back and neck and brain which had not been checked the day of the accident - despite me saying I landed on my entire back and neck. Now, I was in denial about hitting my head, so I said I didn’t hit it, but really I did, I just didn’t feel it because everything happened so fast and I was wearing a helmet.

Fast forward almost two years and I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia with an onset of this injury. I am basically extremely limited in what I can do because I did not properly heal from my injuries because THEY WERE UNFOUNDED for six(thoracic) and eight months(cervical).

Now I believe I have to prove they caused this, not that I just would have ended up with it anyway. My argument and firm belief based on my experience is that because I did not know about the herniated discs in my back and neck, was put on crutches on those herniated discs, was advised, I could lift things on herniated discs that we were unaware of, did things when I returned back to work that I would not have done had I known that I had a back injury, I stated that I had nerve pain from the very beginning in my upper back/mid back. This was ignored by multiple doctors despite my worsening symptoms.

From my research, I can see that when doctors do not find nerve issues in the pelvic MRI and the lumbar MRI, that they are supposed to then look further up the spine for issues radiating down. Also the fact that they did not check my entire spine after the kind of injury that I had is just asinine!!

Does anyone have any advice or info on this? 

I believe I ended up with an incurable painful syndrome at 34 years old because my back was not treated properly and found at the initial accident. I could have healed those injuries before doing the things I did. And I guarantee you that they would never have put me on crutches if they had known that I had herniated discs up there. They would’ve given me a walker.

However, along w the laptop, he also took her internet modem, router, phones, and disconnected her landline. His reasoning was that he purchased the equipment for her, so he is taking it back. Now she is left with no WiFi, no landline, and only her government issued cell phone. My grandma protested but, not wanting conflict, eventually allowed him to take it so he would leave.

368,Neighbor’s dog is aggressive and has attacked my roommate’s dog three times now. What can we do?,11tpbik,"Location: Texas

I live in a duplex with my roommate and her dog. Our duplex has a backyard which we share with the unit next door. This has never been an issue until a few months ago when a new neighbor moved in with his 120 pound German Shepard. The neighbor leaves his dog out for hours on end, unattended and not tied up in the shared backyard. This has become an issue because any time my roommate goes to take her dog out or we go to use the backyard, if the German Shepard is in the yard she will charge at and attempt to attack my roommate’s dog. 

I say attempt because she has some pretty gnarly health issues that affect her mobility, so luckily for us, she can’t move very fast. We’ve now had three incidents of an attack, not including a couple of times that she has charged my roommate and I. She has never broken skin except for one time when she bit our HVAC technician. 

We reached out to our neighbor and requested that he not leave her unattended in the backyard for multiple hours at a time so that my roommate can use the backyard throughout the day to take her dog out. The other unit in the duplex also has a side yard (which is NOT shared) that we suggested he keep her in instead. 

He was surprised about his dog’s behavior and said he would keep her inside, but unfortunately nothing has changed. My roommate’s dog was attacked again yesterday when I was taking her out and it really shook me up. I’m between calling our property management company or animal control. We are tired of that dog’s presence determining if we can use the backyard or not. Do I have any options here to get the dog removed?

ETA: Before either of us take my roommate’s dog out, we do always check to see if the German Shepard is out there first and use the front yard if she is. The incident yesterday happened because the dog was laying behind a tree and I didn’t see it when I checked.

Update: After I reached out to property management, they contacted the neighbor and requested that the dog be removed from the premises immediately. Apparently mine is not the first report they’ve gotten. The neighbor sent me about 20 text messages about how his dog gets along great with other dogs, he’s spent so much money on her medical care, I was ruining his life, he fought for my country (he is a navy vet) and he didn’t appreciate me repaying him this way, now she has to be on the street because of me. He basically tried to guilt me into thinking this was all somehow my fault. I told him if he had issues with the decision to have her removed that he needs to take it up with management and that I would not be discussing the issue further. I’ll continue to follow up with management in the coming days regarding the dog’s removal.

Hopefully he will either leave the property himself to stay with the dog or the dog will be re-homed to a more responsible and loving owner.

369,Non-married ex wants me to sign a quitclaim deed,11uscg2,"My ex partner and I have recently split. Before the split in 2022, we paid a lawyer to write up a contract to get 50/50 of the house via a buyout or sell. We looked over the draft, he and I verbally agreed to the terms, then via email, my ex confirmed with the law firm to finalize the document. We paid them $1k, then once we received the contract, my ex and I never got around to signing it (big mistake, I know).

Flash forward to today and now my ex doesn't want to uphold that contract we verbally agreed / paid the lawyer $1k for. Instead, he's working with a new attorney to offer me $60k ($20k less than what my half of the equity would be in a buyout) if I sign a quitclaim deed. In this offer he also states:
- he will pay me $60k via a HELOC on our house, applied to his credit, once I sign the quitclaim deed
- he will refinance the house once the housing rates drop down to 4%, thus taking me off the mortgage (we split 50/50 closing costs, I forfeit rights to any additional equity)
- he would assume responsibility for all mortgage and escrow payments
- if he defaults payment, the house goes to sale or refi immediately to prevent foreclosure
- in the event of his death, his mother would have the option to negotiate a buyout or sale with me 

I told him I wanted to see the contract (this was all drafted in notes) first before we discussed anything further. This makes me very uneasy, but I want to work things out with him. Is there a way I can protect myself so that we both 'win'? My ex doesn't want to sell, nor does he want me to buy him out under our original unsigned contract...if we had to go to court, is this favorable for me or him? We've split everything house-related 50/50 and I have receipts. 

I'm already asking around for attorneys too, so if you have any advice/questions I can ask my attorney that'd be appreciated. Thank you.",nommymcnommerson,2,0,0.5
370,Mother in law threatening to sue over loan (NC),11uyhtu,"In November I landed a new job that would let my family move to NC to be closer to wife’s family. We were in a difficult financial spot and so moving was going to be difficult for us, however we got a plan together for me to live with a friend while I gathered the money from my new much higher paying job with the intent of bringing the family up in aprox 6 months or so.

Well my MiL decided that she would rather have the kids and my wife here sooner rather than later and offered to get a loan to help us move with the agreement we would pay her back with our tax refund this year. We made it very clear to her that we would not be guaranteed a large sum like we had previously gotten and if not would give her what we had and make payments every month on the loan until we got some of my bonus checks in. She agreed. 

Well we got our confirmation this week that our refund is going to be much less than the $6000 we owe my MiL. She’s now threatening to sue if we don’t pay the full sum by the end of the month (which isn’t even remotely possible for us). We have been making payments towards the loan and even reached out as soon as we found out about the loan to make other arrangements to cover the Loan.

I went and checked there is no damage to his vehicle.  I could just see very very minor scratch which could not be possible with my car dent. He is asking for insurance details, should i be giving him the details ? I have not clearly done anything here. I'm not at fault and he doesn't even tell the exact date. He says its in recent times. Should i be calling cops ?

Update: so I have spoken to him directly, he is accusing me of a scratch on his left side of the car from the bumper damage of my right side of car. Whatever he is saying is based on assumption that I have a sharp edge and he didn’t take out his car for a month. There doesn’t seem to be a cc camera or dash cam video . He wants me to give the insurance details and let the insurance company decide if I had hit it or not. If I don’t give he would be going to file a hit and run which is quite baseless.

380,Tenant Rights - California - Deposit - Retaliatory Landlords,11uwx9r,"My housemates and I live in California. Our landlords gave a previous tenant their full deposit back and a letter of recommendation upon moving out, the landlords were given verbal notice and text message notice of this tenant vacating prior to me moving into the residence and signing a lease. Similar to the last tenant that moved out, the landlords were given over 30 days text notice when I was planing on moving out before my other housemates. The other tenants were originally planning on filling that room, then decided that they were going to move out instead.. I had not received my deposit by the time my other housemates decided to move, which was over 21 days after I moved out, and my prior landlords are now claiming that they do not owe me my deposit until 21 days after my other housemates move out. The landlords are now claiming that text is not sufficient and that they will be withholding my deposit until the 21-day period after my other housemates vacated the premises. It has not been 21 days yet, and they are claiming to still be going through the ""discovery period"" as they themselves move back into the residence after not living there for 15+ years. Collectively my housemates and I lived there for 3 years, there were prior renters to any of us living in that house. They have stated that they will be withholding some of the deposit and producing receipts by next week. I believe they will be withholding the deposit because there was a mouse that they alerted us to when they replaced an appliance in the home, but they never took care of the mouse and replaced the appliance knowing that there was a mouse living behind that area. We as tenants did our best to try and eradicate the mouse, but not before it ate through a wire and the appliance broke again. The landlords stated in a walk through with my housemates that they would be charging us, the tenants, for a new dishwasher as we were unable to catch the mouse. However, landlords are responsible for eradicating pests, and this would constitute uninhabitable living conditions. Our home was always clean and our landlords would often remark at how clean it was when they needed to come and repair something. Additionally, while living there the wiring that they had previously done themselves stopped working and the entire electrical panel needed to be replaced. We did not have power in 2 rooms, the hallway, or the bathrooms for over maybe 3+ weeks, while the tried to figure out what was going on. They never compensated or reduced our rent when we did not have electricity in multiple areas of the house. Withholding the deposit and claiming we owe them for the dishwasher (and who knows what else?) seems like retaliatory behavior. It seems like they are trying to find anything they can because they are the ones moving back into the house now.  They also gave the previous tenant that moved out their entire deposit back. Note, I lived in this house for less than 6-months and the house is in the same condition, if not better, as when I moved in.

381,Doc ignored messages. I have cancer,11v9q6c,"I called my doctor's office and had message sent describing symptoms and asking for a referral to specialist. No response.  8 days later I send another message.  RN asks what referral I'm talking about and just lists off 2 unrelated ones.  I restated symptoms and my request.  RN replies and acknowledges receipt, says she's forwarding on to doc or a covering provider if doc wasn't available.  This was all on that 8th day from initial message.

Still nothing comes back to me.

On day 19 I call and insist on someone talking to me and have a mssg sent because they wouldn't pick up.  Minutes later an RN calls from the office.  I restated symptoms again to her and she says I should go to ER and questions why I hadn't.  I insisted on also getting an appointment for the next day and could only get one via phone, but I took it.  This evening I went to ER but wasn't able to stay long enough to be seen.

So morning of day 20 comes and the PA calls me.  I restate again symptoms and he questions why I hadn't gone to ER because these symptoms definitely warrant it.  (If pain were more significant I would have, but it was intermittent)

I finally was able to get to ER that afternoon.  Tests and 7 hours later I have a neoplasm (cancer).  The ER doc was mad at my doc for not having me go in when I initially messaged them.  Not as mad as I was.

Obviously I'm changing docs but I'm preoccupied with taking care of what I can to protect my family from whatever will happen. 

Last thing I want is to deal with cancer and a lawsuit at the same time, but this can't be allowed to happen to anyone else.  Cancer got 3 weeks of unhindered growth and I don't know how much less damage may have been done if I had just been told it warranted an ER visit in the first place.

382,Informally evicted by assisted living,11v5790,"I (36) live in a group home and am female. 

In my group home there are 4 rooms, two upstairs and two downstairs. Two guys live upstairs which is fine, and the understanding was always that the room downstairs was for another female. Whoever moved in was always female and we’d share a bathroom. Well, a month ago the manager let’s call F, she unexpectedly moved a male in next to me. This is triggering to me and I express to F that I don’t feel safe even though the client seems fine. I have trouble sleeping because I’m fearful that the client will break into my room even though I logically understand he won’t. 

So finally after talking with my support people (who were upset F moved a male directly next to me given the entire reason for my being in a group home was ptsd around men) I decided to get on a waitlist for a supportive housing apartment, where I’d be alone with mental health support. Basically a group home but it’s an apartment and more privacy.  The waitlist is “a couple or few months out”. I tell F. She’s heart broken - I was her favorite client as she’s said over the past 2 years. She tries to convince me to stay. Move upstairs next to a diff client. Etc. 

Anyway, now that I’ve officially told her I’m moving, she wants me to move out early, before I come up on the waitlist. She says she has a person for my room, then denies having said that. She’s using things I said 6 months ago against me saying being here is bad for me. She literally wants me to move out to wait to move into the apartment. 

I always was weary around her - I’ve seen her fuck over clients before. I was hoping it wouldn’t be me. She keeps saying what if the waitlist is longer than a few months. I keep reminding her her responsibility is to me first, not a prospective client but she’s playing it like she’s doing it for me when she’s never, ever brought up me leaving.

397,Part of Road that I live on is blocked off,11uy5qz,"Hey, I don't know much about road laws and I'm unsure how to describe my situation in specific detail. I live on a dirt road with several other people. The road goes off the highway and terminates in a loop that allows someone to turn around. The last 1/7th of this road, along with the aforementioned loop, is now blocked off by a gate.

I don't know the exact details, but I believe everyone on the road ""owns"" a bit of it, from what my parents say we have an easement agreement or something on ours that prohibates us from blocking it. This would make sense since we live in the middle of the road. 

My question is, are the people at the end allowed to close off this road to the rest of us? We don't own anything down there ourselves, but we've used the dirt road freely for almost two decades now. I can't even ride my bike all the way down the road anymore. I live in Arkansas.

also living in the house are my 56 y/o father, my eldest sister and her husband, my 16 y/o sister and her 3m/o baby; all of us are tenants without a lease

recently my mom left my dad and now he's been going on a near constant destructive streak throughout the upstairs area he stays in with my sister/BiL

he keeps threatening suicide, has threatened to kill my other sister's bf, has shot holes in his bedroom wall, has knocked holes in the wall with a sledgehammer, and absolutely refuses to seek help or change his situation.

I keep my door locked and fear for my life as well as the lives of my grandma, niece, and my pets

we have called the police many times but they won't do anything, saying that since he's not committing a federal offense they can't come in and apprehend him

on the rare occasions he is arrested, he's held for a few hours and then let back out where he continues

yesterday, after his suicide threat, they said for us to call them so they can evaluate him; they knocked on the door telling him to come out with his hands up, and when he didn't, they just turned and walked away

my grandmother refuses to evict him because he's her son and she can't kick out her child; she will not see any fault in his actions and enables his behavior

I can't do it anymore, I'm tired of living in this hell; I have nowhere to go, work a minimum wage job, and the closest friend lives in a house with a no pet rule

402,"New place I moved to has some leaks and electrical issues, could I be on the hook? (SoCal)",11utk7v,"Southern California/LA

&#x200B;

Moved to a super cute new place in a nice area of town. But the landlord is elderly and the place has been fixed up on the cheap. When I shower, there are leaks. The fridge icemaker sometimes leaks water. And there are visible electrical issues - lights will change in intensity, power will sometimes go out, causing the Internet router etc to reboot. My PC got turned off from this one time while I was home.

&#x200B;

Given how beautiful where it is and the market, I won't find a place at that price elsewhere if I dismiss these 'quirks'.

&#x200B;

My concern though is that if the water was left on the ground when I was out of town, or should something more severe happen - what am I responsible for as a renter?

I have Renters' ins.

I have notified her of some of the leaks, seems pointless to keep mentioning it, except from a documentation standard to protect myself perhaps?

I haven't mentioned electrical issues yet. It's not a huge deal, the lights flicker. The Internet went out 2-3x (it's been a week), my PC shut off once. But I'm concerned about possible more serious things like fire etc. They put electric heaters in the place which has been really nice, but one seems to have.. ""melted""; there is some sort of cable drooping from it now and charred external shielding. I intend to take a pic and let them know this weekend.

&#x200B;

**Could I be on the hook for any of this if not fixed? Collateral damages perhaps? (Water leak and electric issue causing additional damage, ruined floors, etc?)** I don't get the idea that they are looking to keep the place tip top, I more get the idea they are at the end of their reign, without much support, unable to do a lot of the work without subbing out to people who would do substandard job.

409,"Dealership forged my signature and I have proof, what can I do",11tsoy7," I purchased the car a couple years ago and just realized the paperwork given to the lender is not the one I signed. In fact I was at work at the date and time the “signature” shows.  I work for a very large health system so there would be no question of the validity of my time sheet. 

 I had purchased a car through this dealership before and had no issues, so it never occurred to me to look over the documents the lender has. 

 Right after the purchase of the car I went through a messy divorce and have no idea where the copies of the electronic paperwork ended up. I’m having issues with the lender ( bad financial decisions led to using a sup prime lender) so I started digging into and found that the document they have on file is not even close to the terms I agreed to and signed.  Right away I went to the dealership to ask for copies of the contract ( didn’t tell them why I needed them) I was told they had since switched owners so it was archived and the lady that deals with that will email them to me the next day.  Well that never happened so for the past few months I’ve been trying to get ahold of them and have been unable to- no return calls, emails etc. finally I sent a certified letter and got a call the day after they received the letter.  I knew the number that popped up and didn’t answer because I wanted everything talked about in writing. I emailed the financing officer and was given the run around for about three weeks and yesterday he finally told me that the contract has been destroyed because they only keep them for a short amount of time, then send to their headquarters in Indiana who store them for a certain amount of time before destroying. ( I bought this car 11/30/19) I asked for the contact information of the headquarters in Indiana and he told me he isn’t allowed to give that to me and that was the last I heard from him.

The mother has CPS at her house regularly because her other two children have mental health issues, as a direct result from her parenting. She lets them drink, smoke, and stay home from school to do as they please. The older child has now dropped out, and the younger has been held back in 8th grade 3 times now with an abundance of learning disabilities.

12:07 PM - I successfully canceled it and watched Freddy push the button on his tablet canceling the order. He said that if the charge hadn't gone through yet it wouldn't... And if it did go through I would get a refund. I went home. 
7:41 PM - I got an email confirming the order even though I had canceled it. 

Friday 3/17
12:08 AM - Got an email with tracking information about the phone saying it is on its way.

Today the shipment still says on its way and the charge is still pending. I have this timeline because of messages I sent to my partner and because Gmail shows the exact time you got your emails. At this point have they sent me something I didn't want? I saw the order get canceled, and seven hours later they were confirming it... 

If I have to bring it back, am I obligated to pay their $50 restocking fee on the phone I didn't want?

433,Questions about brothers case,11uj4h4,"Hi, so long story short.. my brother that’s a year older than me got arrested recently. Unfortunately this has become a situation where this has become a relief to my family and I because then he is not on the streets. For the past couple years he has bounced around homeless shelters, he honestly fits in with that crowd and gets along with them.. he’s stayed with me a few time in the past but come be unpredictable and moody. I just got married a year ago and 8m preg now so taking care of him financially/emotionally is harder.
Recently he was arrested again, we were hoping they would do a psych hold on him. He needed it. Last time they just let him go after a domestic violence issue. His wife is not the most stable either. Anyway, they diagnosed him with schizophrenia. Sadly he has been diagnosed with different things over the year but nothing has seemed to stick- Manic, Schizophrenia, Bipolar. He is 1000% the ultimate narcissistic, blames everyone around him for everything.
My question is, is there a way to talk to judge to recommend some sort of mandatory check-ins like outpatient therapy or something? He needs professional help but refuses to get himself. He’s 31 now so not a lot we can do as a family. He’s just gotten worse over the years and I’m afraid one day he’s just going to run into the wrong person while having one of his episodes.",NoPen7856,2,0,0.33
434,adult guardianship,11ucv09,"I'm a disabled adult. Or supposedly disabled. I don't want to say my age but I'm way over 18.

I'm wondering what rights do I have as a disabled adult. After all, the Americans with Disabilities Act is a thing so my rights should be protected under that.

Okay, can my guardian legally take my phone if I do something she doesn't approve of? To clarify, it won't be for doing anything bad per se. But for stuff that other people do every day such as being on Facebook or talking to friends she doesn't like (which brings me to my next question).

Can my guardian legally tell me who I can and can't talk to or be friends with? And it won't be because someone is a bad or dangerous person. It'll be because she doesnt like the person for some judgy or superficial reason or because she doesn't like someone the person is related to (again, for some judgy or superficial reason). She will judge people based on what they wear, their style, etc. or their lifestyle (and I don't mean lifestyle as in selling drugs or prostituting but I mean like if someone is into New Ageism or Wicca, etc.). Or if someone is gay or trans. Just stuff she doesnt approve of (don't have to be bad or dangerous stuff either).

And my third question. Can my guardian legally keep me from dating or having sex? Do I have the legal right to have a romantic/sexual relationship? If someone has sex with me, could my guardian press charges and would I have a say in the matter to tell my side of the story (that I wanted to do it, that I like the person, that nothing is really wrong with me and it's all a mistake/misdiagnosis/misunderstanding or that my guardian is just delusional and think I'm disabled when I'm really not which I do suspect, especially after learning about the Gypsy Rose Blanchard story)?",PoeticPeacenik,42,5,0.72

I questioned it twice and the landlord confirmed it was March 5th and even gave me a $300 bill as last payment for that month. I hurriedly signed a lease elsewhere and moved out by March 5th- cleaning the apartment and returning the keys to the office. Now I am receiving a bill saying I owe 1k something still because my lease doesn’t end until March 25th.

I had to quickly move a month earlier than expected as well as having to pay all initial fees ~3k for the new apartment and now a 1k bill for the old apartment I am not even living in. I have receipts for all of my payments and the email chain with the manager confirming my March 5th move out date.  Please advise. What actions can I take and do I have a case?

But for the sake of the investigation, they were going to take my work laptop anyway. Apparently, once the verdict of the investigation is decided. I'll either be allowed to come back to work or terminated. That was the gist of my talk with HR. After this, I was promptly escorted out of the building with security.

We're both contract workers hired through a recruiting firm, and this one person is the only one I regularly talk to. She is also the only one on our team I directly work with. I was the same deal for her up until recently when she gained a new friend.

445,Neighbor’s kids keep tossing trash over privacy fence.,11u7usg,"The neighbors moved in about a year and a half ago. For the most part, they’re fine, though there have been some unrelated incidents when their personal drama was presented to the entire neighborhood. However, since they’ve moved in we occasionally find misc trash in our backyard. Everything from torn paper plates to broken toys to lube to a three legged cast iron porch chair. The latest was two shot glasses, a port glass, a few Fireball individuals, and the shattered remains of what I assume is a third shot glass. 

The chair has been toss over twice, and matches those on their back porch. We have never witnessed the acts, but every time we’ve confronted them with the items, they’ve claimed ownership. 

We don’t have cameras yet, as I still need to talk to my landlord. After the last time, 2nd time with the chair, I determined our course of action would be filing police reports if for no other reason than to officially document the history in the event something escalates this matter to a court room, such as my dog being injured, prompting us to sue for vet bills. My intention was only to state the facts, which would only include pointing the finger at the neighbor if I had a solid fact doing so, such as him stating “Yeah, that baggie of nuts and bolts is mine. I thought the kids to throw them in the trash. I’m so sorry. I’ll talk to them.”

However, after we found the shot glasses, the officer told my wife it’s a civil matter, they can’t do anything, and wouldn’t be filing the report because we hadn’t actually witnessed the act. I’ve since talked to the neighbor, and he again claimed ownership of the shot glasses. 

Is this illegal dumping?
Now that I have his admission of ownership of the shot glasses, do I have something concrete to file the police report?

A few weeks ago my mother unexpectedly passed away as well leaving me as her next of kin. As far as I can tell, taxes for 2022 had not been filed yet. I have questions regarding both tax filing and handling of the estate and potential tax debt

From what I can understand, I would be legally responsible for filing their taxes. However, I have no idea about their tax history (i.e whether they filed jointly or separately), limited information on financials from the year as I only have my mothers W2, and have a suspicion there may have been some tax debt from prior years. Not saying they didn’t file because I believe they did, I just think they didn’t always have the money or pay what they owed. 

This is in Minnesota and estates under $75,000 with no real property don’t go through probate, which this meets that criteria. The estate has just enough money to cover the funeral services and an older car with very little value. There will be no inheritance from the estate and my intent is to pay for the funeral and leave the few hundred remaining in her account for now.

Saying that, what is the best way to go about filing taxes for them? How do I find out if there is any tax debt? Lastly, from what I can find tax debt is one that doesn’t go away with death. Can they hold me as the next of kin responsible for that money?",fur_missile,3,2,1.0

She persistently told him that she’s not interested and to stop, but he didn’t get the message and says he doesn’t respect her relationship with me and that he wont stop until she says yes. For cultural context, they are both Hispanic and recent immigrants. He somehow got her address, from a mutual work friend, showed up to her apartment multiple times (and on one occasion, drunk). 

She filed a report with HR on Monday, days after the last occasion where he showed up drunk, and he’s now being transferred to a different department. I drove her to work that day and also picked her up to take her home. She heard from office gossip that he left work early. On that same day, we’ve installed a door cam and a camera outside her window facing the entrance to her building so we can have proof if he comes again.

This same day, Monday night, I slept over her place to help give her peace of mind and I woke up to my work car being scratched with a very fine object, the damage is not rugged like a key, so I’m thinking it was a possible blade. There’s a city camera that has direct sight of the car in the street. I work for a black car company and this is significantly impacting my work - I can no longer keep the vehicle with me and I have to drive to the company now for every job I do and can’t keep the car with me because they think I was negligent with company property.

(He said I followed him to another part of the building, but it was a 10+ minute gap from the time he went there and I went there and I had a purpose - put a check on someone’s desk- visible on camera. When confronted with this, he basically backed off. 

I had a one on one meeting with the owner and he basically said he doesn’t want either one of us to leave, doesn’t want to burn bridges, etc. but agreed it must stop. Anyway, holidays came and he was out of office for part of it and then I was out first week in Jan. During the time I was out on PTO, more of the same continued. I’m not doing my job, I’m hiding stuff from management, acting immature, messing with his computer or phone, spying on him, blah blah blah. 

While out I started looking into other jobs. I was offered one and accepted it hoping this would be the end. As I get ready to give my notice, the owner and him wanted one final conversation to see if it could be worked out. That conversation was a disaster. So I give a notice, agree on an exit plan (company will pay my health insurance while I’m in the waiting period aslong as I’m available for questions that may arise). I’m also an IT person and had discussed with the owner that I would still assist in that area with them as a freelance client (I have others). Needless to say the guy didn’t like that and threw a fit. Basically all of this has now gotten WORSE since I left. He has -

Told multiple people that I stole money, both inside and outside the company. 
Said I was withholding multiple people paychecks, showing favoritism, etc. 
Said I was Lying about cost of things
Said I did stuff without owners approval. 
Disclosed personal information to people inside and outside the company that he gained access to after I left. 

And has even gone as far as reaching out to one of my freelance clients essentially trying to get them to drop me as their tech. 

He also was trying to get one of the reps to say that I was stealing and even lied to the owner saying they said something they didn’t. The rep is a really good friend of mine so they told me everything. He wasn’t aware I was good friends with them though. 

What I have - 
I have screenshots of emails of him threatening he won’t ‘play nice’ anymore
Screenshot of emails of him saying his check was wrong ‘4 times in a row’ but payroll records show otherwise, 
communication between him and the rep mentioned above and then what he told the owner being different. 
Camera footage that shows I did not ‘stalk him’ on the day he claimed. 

He doesn’t have money (in fact he’s having to give his brother money to help repay money his brother appearently embezzled) so I’m not going to get anything money wise. Which I’m ok with. I just want it to stop. 

What are my options? Thoughts? If I could drop $1.5-2k and this be a done deal I pretty much would in a heart beat.",NpaMA,0,0,0.5

So I was diagnosed with ADHD and started on Concerta a little over a month ago. I was told that I would be subjected to random drug testing, which makes sense to make sure I’m actually taking it. However, I was told that if it comes back positive for weed that I would not be able to get my prescription anymore. I live in a state where it is recreationally legal. Is my doctor actually allowed to do that? How is it really any different from having a drink? I was not told I can’t drink alcohol, which I would think would be more of an issue… I enjoy smoking every now and then, just like having a drink. It’s fun. Why is that so bad?
My doctor said it’s also company policy. So can I just be refused from being able to see any doctor there if they do find weed in my system? I also have a PCP that I see through them. I just don’t see how that would be right. Isn’t there something about “duty/continuity of care”?

467,Father died - No communication with stepmom about the Will,11u6szh,"Dad died on October 2022, in Nevada. Since the funeral in November, my sister and I's former stepmom has ignored all of our communication. We haven't even asked about the will, we've just been calling and texting to check in on her. I sent a Christmas card as well. 

We were never particularly close, in fact, she made a lot of effort to separate our father from us and completely left us out of the obituary, did not include any photos of us in the photo slideshow at the reception after the funeral, even their preacher did not mention us in his addressing the crowd, saying everyone related to the deceased in different ways, some as a husband, employer, colonel, or friend (he didn't say "" as a father""). We were not asked or given a chance to speak about our father. The only person that spoke at his funeral was my former stepmom. We had asked but she said they already have everything planned. It was very strange. 

So, we shouldn't be surprised that she's cut off contact, but it still hurt. I was telling a friend about this and she asked me, ""Have you seen a copy of the will?"" and I told them, ""No, I haven't"". This hadn't even occurred to me, to be honest. She told me that maybe our stepmom is strategically avoiding us to not talk about it/have to share it. I don't think there are many assets to be had, as my former stepmom would remain living in their house + his pensions would support her as she may live many more years, and after his stay at the hospital, I imagine they have quite a bit of medical debt now. So, I wasn't expecting anything really. But, it did get me curious.

So, I finally called the county where they lived/he died and found out that the will has not been filed with the probate office. I guess this is the office that executes the will or any transfer of property, etc. The law clerk gave me an example, like if a will stated that a grandparent wanted to sell their car to their grandchild for $10, the probate office would be the office to make that happen and transfer the title for the sale of the car for $10. 

So, the kind (and not providing legal advice) law clerk said, if there were no assets to transfer, then she might not have the motivation or reason to probate the will (because the pensions would automatically go to her, she has her name on the house, she got her life insurance check already, etc.). But, that means that if my sister and I were mentioned in the will, we'd never know. If by probating it, she'd stand to lose any assets or money, then maybe she wouldn't do it. There's no ""will police"" that will track someone down for not executing a will. And a friend suggested there may even be a statute of limitations on claiming that you were included in a will. 

I haven't just point-blank asked her for a copy of the will just yet, but she hasn't responded to any of our texts or calls just to check in on her, so I don't feel that would be successful. 

I've been told to consult with a lawyer, but I really don't want to pay a lawyer's fees just to get a copy of the will and find out that sure, enough, my sister and I weren't in the will (and then I have to pay the lawyer fees out of my own pocket). A friend of mine said, in some states it doesn't matter, they have automatic percentages that go to different family members, but I'm not trying to scam my stepmom out of money (even though she's a pretty awful person). I just want to know what my Dad's original intentions or wishes were. I know while alive my Dad had said that he hoped to give my sister and me a bit of the sale of the movie (he was gonna get like 3-5% and verbally said he wanted to help me and my sister out some). I wonder if he put it in the will. I doubt it, it was probably just something that when the money came in, he could share a bit with us, just an idea/hope. But, yeah, I'm just really curious and don't know what to do. It's a sad and painful situation and any help is appreciated!",SnooSeagulls20,6,4,0.75

477,A part-family member owes me roughly $3800,11uevic,"TLDR:I worked with my aunt's boyfriend under the table for about 5 months, he owes me almost $4k, and I have been promised to get the money for about a year and a half now and have still not seen a penny. He has also blocked my phone number and refuses to communicate.

Hello all,

I apologize for any excessive details but I feel that some context is necessary. In 2021 I graduated high school, and at the time, I lived with my father, stepmom, my stepmom's sister(so my aunt we'll call her), my aunt's boyfriend, and a couple of my sisters as well. Around the time I had graduated, my aunt's boyfriend had recently started his own painting business and he needed some help with some paint jobs. My family thought it would be a good job and skills to learn to have me work with him after high school, mostly for the summer and the fall. My aunt's boyfriend said he would pay me a little above minimum wage($16/hour), but that it would be under the table so that it would sort of ""help us both out"".

I worked for him for roughly four months from June 2021 to October 2021 because it ended up becoming such a terrible job. I would work anywhere between 9-14 hours a day, with super inconsistent days on and off, sometimes overnight, and as time went on he began to pay me very inconsistently. In his eyes, I was one of his lowest ""priorities"" to pay money because I already had some savings of my own(which he of course knew about) and because I was ""family"" too. On top of the bad hours and schedule, it was a very toxic work environment as well. He would take the jobs as an opportunity to talk shit about all of my family members, including his own girlfriend(my aunt), and he was also just an extremely negative person who would lose his mind if he didn't get his way or if you didn't do things according to his exact rules. He would have spit flying out of his mouth with rage if any of the other few men we worked with stood up to him, and he would even get so angry that he would want to settle these conversations with coworkers by **literally having physical fights** with them.

I was always promised that I would get paid at some point, over and over, and I was honestly too gullible, I feel like this man took advantage of me in many ways. I even lent some of my own money to him so we could buy many cans of wood stain because he couldn't afford it at the time. He was basically using each paint job we completed to pay for the supplies from the previous job. I did everything properly, when I got a new job, I gave my 2 weeks to him, and all was good on that end, besides still being promised that I would be paid. I was also living in this house still, and my aunt is the owner of the house, so I was paying rent to her and her boyfriend technically. When I had my new job, I would ask a few times a month when I would be finally paid, as I wasn't even working with him anymore. Whenever this happened, this man became enraged again and didn't want to talk about it, and he would specifically pull me aside alone to tell me not to talk about it in front of anyone who lives in the house, and promised me again that it would come eventually, but that it would be a while. I of course told my dad and one of my sisters all about this each time. It sucks to have my family involved in this problem, but at least they know what's going on.

I moved out of this house to live on my own in January 2022, and as time went on I tried to maintain contact with this man and keep asking when I would get my money, which I have a record of on my phone of course. I have the list of the exact amount of hours I was not paid for, and how much money I lent him as well, and I have sent it to him multiple times. I would also communicate with my aunt(considering they are dating) and she constantly promised me as my aunt that I would rightfully get how much I'm owed at some point. I have given them both nothing but time and waited this whole time patiently to get anything. I have given them extra time as well because their dog died and there were many expensive vet bills I was told. My stepmom keeps in contact with her sister(my aunt) and so she would update me occasionally on how their lives are going, and she encouraged me to wait and give them time as well because both my aunt and her boyfriend were not doing good financially. Turns out her boyfriend was so irresponsible with managing the painting company that he had to close it down, and there were so many unpaid bills from his paint job that there were debt collectors withdrawing money from my aunt and her boyfriend's bank accounts because of it. Also around July of 2022, both my aunt and her boyfriend blocked my cellphone number out of the blue. So I have been giving them time and have been relatively unable to contact them this whole time.

First off I know this is usually said as a joke but in this case I'm truthfully asking for a friend. Also because in most cases it matters, this is occurring in Washington State. My friend (38 F) has been in a relationship with her boyfriend (46 M) for about 6 years and for about the past 4 they have lived together in the house that she solely owns. Things in their relationship have been going south for about a year but as of about 2 months ago she has given up on the relationship and just wants him gone. He continues to be belligerent and emotionally/verbally abusive, he drinks every single day, and he has also been physically abusive in the past but not recently. That being the case she has indirectly brought up the idea of him moving out and he has made it clear that he won't, at one point even saying that she'll have to serve him an eviction notice. We've both done some online research and from what we've found because he's established residence there he can not be evicted barring any further threats or acts of violence. For the last 2 weeks she has said to me things like ""I'm just waiting for him to beat me up again so I can get him to leave"" and she says she's joking but I think deep down she means it. Of course this is the last thing I want to happen so I'm desperate to find another way to get him out. Thank you in advance.

My husband and I have a mortgage on a condo since 2019. This week, for the second time, one of the old pipes sprung a pinhole leak which we noticed when it soaked through the drywall.

We tried to reach out to the HOA because the insurance person said they should cover it, but we were ghosted until we gave up.

Now, when it happened a second time I called a plumber right away and got the repiping started because I need my home to have functioning plumbing. I paid half of the estimate up front so they would get started and we may have to finance the other half if no one pays out. Insurance is sending an inspector Monday and are again saying they only cover the water damage from the leak. The insurance adjuster again advised that we get the HOA to pay the plumbers, so I sent an email when I was again repeatedly sent to voicemail.

493,"Apartment Complex Bait and Switch (Austin, TX)",11u4p67,"Hello all,

I recently applied for an apartment on March 6th for a lease starting March 17th. Background check went through March 8th. I did not hear anything from the complex until calling on March 14th, and I received an approval letter for unit on March 16th via email and text through Appfolio. Included in the text is a message saying to activate the online portal to pay the security deposit of $300, which I did.

Upon corresponding with the manager via the text, we schedule a call and I receive the call from a different number where I learn that the unit I intend to move into is not available anymore, but that I can possible get a different unit, one that is 30% less sq.ft., or wait for an available unit in April or May. I have decided not to continue with this complex for obvious reasons, namely not getting the apartment that I had applied for.

I understand I am entitled to my deposit and application fee back under Texas Property Code 92.354 (Or 3x the value + $100 if I have to sue) but do I have any other methods of remedy? this feels very illegal to bait and switch the apartment to try and force me into a smaller unit under the duress of being homeless.

Brother started drugs when i was 10. became high school dropout and stayed home all day and night. later developing schizophrenia and would have hour long rants about how he wants me and my family dead. then, after he got bored of weed, he started experimenting with *hardcore* (drugs cocaine, fentanyl , ect) causing alterations so bad where police had to get involved

by the time i turned eleven or twelve , he  became suicidal. mom found rope in his room while he was on a schizophrenic episode saying he wanted to hang himself so i could watch. police were called , they took him to a hospital for eval and potentially being hospitalized at a mental facility. 
stayed the 72 hours at the hospital & came back home . 

never ending loop , he gets high and drunk, quits his job, has rambling schizophrenic episodes that scare me so bad, parents still give him money and a car . despite him destroying our last cars and causing thousands in damages , gets a job, grace period, gets violent and it starts again

495,"Was served for a past debt, debt got transferred, does judgment stand?",11u85id,"Good evening.

In 2020 I had a few sessions with a doctor and for one reason or another I did not pay the bills (negligence on my part). These debts eventually went to collections and I was served by the collection company in 2021 or 2022. I did not attend the hearing and a judgment was placed against me.

The collections agency was wrapped up and is no longer in business, but a new collections agency has taken on their debt accounts apparently. The new company served my employer with a garnishment demand.

My questions are:

1, Does the judgment for garnishment still stand with the new company, or would they be required to go through the process all over again to serve and garnish me?

2, The two bills in collections are on my credit report as being for $120 and $196 respectively, however the new company is trying to garnish me for a total of $1,190. I have not received an itemized list of debts owed from them yet but I am guessing the $800+ will be interest and fees. Is this legal? This is 73% mark up on the reported debt owed.

I am not trying to dodge the debt but I am wondering if I can delay the garnishment and if perhaps the new company has illegally tacked on fees that I should not be liable for, and what I should look at to ensure the new debt collector is acting faithfully and is not trying to extort me. I am in Utah if that makes a difference.

510,Company is playing run around with my relocation reimbursement,11u2hsu,"I really apologize if this is super long, excess information, or ends up sounding like a rant in certain places so there is a tl;dr at the end, thank you for taking the time to read this.

Back in late December of 2022 I was hired to become an employee of a new tech-forward delivery service in Texas. Originally, they wanted me to relocate from Southern California to Dallas, Texas before the 16th of January so that I could fly out to Virginia for training. I asked for a later date as moving to a new state and being prepared to fly out within two weeks is a little extreme in my opinion. The company completely agreed and decided to move my start date to the 6th of February instead. The good news that really pushed me to move out was the promise of $5000 in reimbursement for relocation assistance. On January 8th, I signed my offer letter and got prepared to move over the next couple weeks.

Once I found a place to live and got my internet service set up, I was able to log on and get to work on the onboarding that was asked of me by the company. This included everything from tax info to direct deposit stuff. However, one thing discussed in the onboarding that I did not receive was access to my email because it was to be set up on my first day (Feb 6).

On January 30th, 2023 I received an email explaining when and where to be on the 6th, what to bring, who I’d be meeting, and a brief overview of the day and weeks to come. I was very excited for the 6th and to start working.

My new contact for the Dallas area we’ll call Sam. Come the 4th of February, I received a phone call from Sam informing me the “hubs” for the delivery service are behind in preparation and therefor they’ll have to move my start date to the 27th of February. I was trying to be patient with the company because they had recently received a massive amount of money from a large corporation, had been making fantastic progress on new quick delivery systems for people, and with all this have been massively expanding their company to six more states. So, I agreed as Sam sounded pretty sure that the 27th would be the date and that he was very apologetic that we had to move the date.

The one weird thing that came up in the conversation was that he asked if I had already quit my previous job? I moved from California for a job I was supposed to start in a few days. I didn't think much of it as I just figured Sam’s life was probably pretty chaotic having to set up all these hubs and employees in a new state.

To be clear, I didn't quit my last job, I lost it because the company unfortunately went under. I got very lucky because my experience in the field was pretty high and I found a few jobs fairly quick. I chose this job because I’ve never lived in Texas and I jump at the opportunity to live in new places. Anyways, I was relying on my own savings and unemployment as income. I saved up enough and calculated unemployment to last a few months so I wasn't worried about waiting until the end of February to start, especially because I should have the reimbursement coming my way.

I decided to check in on the reimbursement while I awaited the end of the month. By February 7th, and after some back and forth, the company agreed to pay out the reimbursement and that I should receive it by February 17, 2023. Unfortunately, this would be the last time any information was passed to me.

I never received the payment on the 17th and there was no record that any payment was pending or coming through. Throughout the following week (Feb 20 - Feb 24) I sent multiple emails trying to get some clarity on the situation and by the end of the week was even including that I would appreciate a response to my emails. 

As I stated earlier, I do not have a company email (or no way of actually accessing it) because it was to be set up when we got to our first day orientation. So, I should have no reason to assume they are sending information there. Even then, all my emails trying to get information have been from my personal email and there are multiple back and forth threads from back in February (after my onboarding) utilizing my personal email. If I or they were not getting through, they should at least try and call me to sort things out about my email if that was the issue.

Around Feb 20, I got another phone call from Sam, before I answered I figured this was a response to my reimbursement issue. Instead, he called to inform me that the hubs were still behind in preparation and my start date would be pushed out again, this time without an estimated date. However, Sam told me he would check in with me on March 1 to discuss the progress.

– Before I continue, at this point I started looking for other employment so that I could support myself while dealing with all this. –

Come February 27, I called Sam to see if he had any information on my reimbursement and to explain the lack of communication on it. He was not happy to hear I’d been treated this way and asked me to forward all my emails to him so that he could send those to his VP. Honestly, this was the biggest breath of fresh air for me and completely reinvigorated my faith in the situation.

Again, I never received the money nor any follow up via phone or email. So, I did what I am so good at doing by this point and called Sam again on March 9th. I explained that I was not very happy about all this and also asked why he never had the update call with me on the 1st. What I am about to write, I did not make up and am quoting as closely as I can. You cannot write this stuff.

Sam’s response was that he figured my phone call with him on the 27th of February was our check-in. However, I clarified that it couldn’t have been because our check-in was supposed to be about my *employment status,* not the completely separate issue of my *reimbursement* which at this point is almost a month overdue.

The update he had for me on the hubs was that the company was having issues receiving the permits to construct the hubs and therefor my estimated start date was in the Summer. He also wanted to push my reimbursement issue to another manager in the Dallas area but could not promise anything would come from it.

So with this information, and after two months of being on the hook, I learned that the company hired me before they even had the building permits to construct the hub I would be working out of. On top of that, I could not promise that anything would come out of my *promised* reimbursement issue.

It was obvious at this point there was only “lip service” happening and that nothing legit was occurring on the other side of the line.

Now, I come for advice. I am more than prepared to take legal action on this issue. I am owed $5000 for reimbursement that I was promised a month ago, I have been strung along for employment with minimal information, and now know I was hired without the possibility of being hired and was never told the truth.

Tl;dr I was hired in January for a company in Texas that promised to reimburse my move up to $5000. After having my start date pushed back multiple times and being ignored about getting my reimbursement, I have finally had enough and are ready to take things into legal hands.

Is there any advice on next steps? If I need to clarify anything, just let me know. Thank you very very much!",promitski,2,3,0.8
511,How are revenge p*rn forums legal?

Multiple posts were made that were directing men to go to her worklplace. I went to the forum and saw a few other girls I know posted under our state's tab. Our state has revenge porn listed as a felony, yet when I reported my own case to the DA they told me it'd ""be too much work"" and i was out of luck..so they don't really enforce it (shocker i know /s)

So how are sites like this legal? Is it because revenge porn is not banned federally? Can i create one for people to post known creeps and predators?? Like for instance, with my case the guy took photos of women who were passed out and would share them or blackmail girls. He admitted to it over text, and i found a bunch of other victims by messaging girls on insta. He threatened to sue me for defamation but everything i messaged to ppl was true AND in his own words. I really wanted to warn other local women about him bc he literally gloated about violating me and these other women.  (and he used his cute puppy to lure ppl in!!!!)

So is it legal to create a site like this or does one exist? I feel it'd be great for the safety of women in general. Once a guy was hitting on me at the bar and he left to go to the restroom, a woman approached me and said ""hey do what you want with this info but that man is dangerous, he dated my friend and beat the shit out of her, here's where you can look up his court case"" and holy shit did that save me.

523,Do I have a case for wrongful termination from my employer?,11ub4e6,"Hi Reddit,

I am currently employed at an independent pharmacy in New York. I work part time, on average 3 days/week since December 2021. I recently discovered that I am legally entitled to sick pay according to the NYS Paid Sick Leave Policy that I did not receive thus far. I figured I was not entitled to sick time because of my part time status and I don't have other benefits such as vacation/holiday pay. To my knowledge, I was supposed to be paid at least 5 days sick pay when I got COVID and had to quarantine right when I started the job in December 2021. In addition, I did not receive 40 hours in 2022 (I have accrued enough hours for the year at the 1 hour accrued per 30 hours worked). I also got sick last month and was supposed to work 27 hours but left early mid shift only working 12 hours (leaving 15 hours that should have been paid using sick time). After learning this, I contacted my employer today and he said (after much back and forth) that he will not pay me any sick time as I was not ""qualified"". I referenced the NYS Paid Sick Leave policy to which he responded he will no longer debate with me and if I wanted to contest him, that I should just hand in my keys and ""we should just end it here."" At the end of work today, someone came to collect the keys. My questions are:

1. I have very clearly in writing that bringing up this sick time pay as a debate would lead to immediate termination. This looks to me very clearly as retaliation. Do I have a strong case for a wrongful termination lawsuit? Is it worth pursuing this route? My sister is a lawyer who would represent me at no charge, but don't know how much compensation these cases usually pay out.
2. He contacted me later tonight saying that officially I will be terminated April 15 and if I can confirm my schedule for next week. Should I continue to work until April 15, and try to recuperate my sick time after termination? Or would this diminish the above retaliation/wrongful termination case?

Basically, I can go one of two ways here. Work until April 15 with confirmed pay and try to get my sick hours payed out to me. Or, I can confirm with my employer that giving my keys today was my termination and very clearly retaliation then sue and try to receive a settlement.

525,Small Claims Court advice & responding to a counterclaim.,11u547z,"Our former landlord kept our entire security deposit for repainting the home we rented for 4 years. They said we damaged the walls by mounting our televisions and hanging curtain rods. Our move out “walk through” was the morning we turned in our keys and the new tenants were taking possession of the home that afternoon. Therefore, we were not given the chance to repair the damages ourselves. I filled a case in small claims court because the bill sent to us by the landlord didn’t have an itemized breakdown of the cost for fixing the holes in the sheetrock. The invoice total was over $3,000 but the landlord said we only had to pay $1,450 of that (the entire amount of our security deposit). 

We were good tenants and took care of the home as if it were our own and we were never a minute late with the rent in four years. 

From the beginning of our residency in the rental, there were major electrical problems. We frequently went days (up to 9 in a row) without hot water because of flooding in the crawl space. Our HVAC system went out too many times to count. The last month we lived there, we had no power for an entire week with temperatures hovering at around 90 degrees. Our landlords “generously” offered us $350 to find alternative lodging (for 3 people and 2 dogs) while the base of our electrical meter was being repaired and county permits were secured to turn the electricity back on in the house. In fact, I had to communicate with the landlord’s electrician and the county permit office, repeatedly, because the landlord disengaged himself from the entire week long process of rectifying the situation in his rental home. 

I have text and email proof of the majority of this ongoing and blatant disregard of the law regarding the warranty of habitability by the landlord. 

I filed my claim and then the landlord (who  also happens to be a LAWYER) filed a counterclaim suing us for $3,140 plus attorney fees and expenses of litigation “due to Plaintiff’s stubborn litigiousness”. 

I don’t understand the legalese of the counterclaim and now I’m super anxious that I’ve started a battle I can’t win. 

Would a judge in a small claims court take into account all of the times we didn’t have hot water, heat, air, or any electricity at all when considering whether or not the landlord should refund my full security deposit or have I screwed myself?",SnooSongs1615,0,2,1.0
526,Not at fault apartment damage,11uatar,"Hey all, so I am currently renting a ‘between apartment’ meant as a temp place while I relocate. The landlord is notoriously shoddy & sue happy.

Again the garage is on the opposite side of my building & I usually only run over there to empty trash or park my car in the garage during bad weather so it has been about 4-5 days. My neighbor told me he noticed it about 2-3 days ago.

527,Is there any legal recourse against a school?,11uk0es,"(Texas - public school)

On Feb. 9, 2023, My daughter didn’t get off the school bus after school so I started searching for her. 

I called everyone i knew and we all started looking for her with no luck. 
After an hour of searching I called the school AP (assistant principle) and left a message saying I’m calling the police because I can’t find my daughter and the last place she was at was the school. None of the parents who were at the school for after school activities could find her there either. I thought she may have been kidnapped. I was panicking.

I hung up and just as I was about to call the police the AP called me back saying they had my daughter and that time has slipped by and didn’t realize the time. They said there was an incident at school during PE and I need to come to the school. 

PE is at 2:30pm,  this call was at 5:46pm. Over 3 hours after the incident.

When i arrive at the school I learned that my daughter was in a fight. But the school did not tell me all the facts. 

I asked to see the video of the incident and the admin advised they had not looked at the video yet and there may be no point as there are many blind spots at PE. 

They then tell me that they are arresting my daughter (she’s 12) for assault causing bodily injury as she punched a girl in the face with a lock. 

They said that all the witnesses said my daughter started the fight for no reason.

My daughter told me that all the girls they talked to were the girls who attacked her and were lying.

My daughter had scratch marks, hits and chucks of her hair all over her.

I asked if they had checked my daughter out for injuries or taken any photos of all the marks on her and they said no. So i took her to the bathroom and took photos of everything. 

My daughter was jumped by 15 girls at school. She had been warned by her friends that they had over heard the group of girls planning the attack during PE as there are no video cameras in the locker room and many known blind spots on the field. 

This school is known for not doing anything to stop bullying and my daughter has seen over and over the administrators doing nothing to help the students so she didn’t say anything to the teachers as she thought they wouldn’t help anyways. 

Sure enough when PE started the group of girls started harassing my daughter and my daughter tried to get away from the girls. She walked to the field to run laps and as she walked outside she picked up a lock and put it in her pocket just in case the girls escalated their harassment to physically attacking her as they said they were going to do.

The girls followed her to the field, calling her names and pushing her. 

My daughter tried to get away from them and as she was walking back towards the school the group of girls swarmed her. They push her and she turns and hits one of the girls in the face with the lock and then all the girls start hitting my daughter, kick her in the back, pull chunks of her hair out. 

The PE teacher stops the fight and takes my daughter to the assistant principle saying that my daughter started the fight. 

She did not though, she defended herself against the group of girls.

They had my daughter arrested when it was clearly self defense. 

The video proves it and yet the school is ignoring the video. 

There is a witness statement confirming what my daughter said happened but they ignored that as well.

Two of the girls who attacked my daughter admitted with written statements that they intended to beat my daughter up and was harassing her but they’ve ignored this as well.

Nothing has happened to the girls who attacked my daughter. 

My daughter though was arrested, suspended for three days, been in ISS for over a month and now they are trying to send her to an alternative school for kids they consider dangerous. 

My daughter has never been in trouble. Never had any disciplinary actions, she’s a good kid who only tries to defend herself against these girls.

I know it was 15 because i counted them in the video. 

The school says there is nothing I can do.  They have immunity and can take any disciplinary action they want. 

My daughter is depressed after this incident, can’t sleep, angry that she is being punished for defending herself while the girls who attacked her were let off without any discipline action at all.  

And to make matters worse, these girls are spreading lies about her at the school saying my daughter attacked them with a knife.

I told the arresting officer and school admin the day after the incident that the girls are spreading lies about what happened but they’ve done nothing about it. 

My daughter has been hearing these lies spreading and it’s making her even more depressed. There seems to be absolutely nothing we can do about it.

The girls who attacked my daughter are known bullies as well.

This school has created a bully mentality. The bullies know they won’t get into trouble and that the school won’t take any action against them. Punishing my daughter and not them only reinforced their belief of this.

In September 2022 my boyfriend was arrested for domestic violence against me. This incident occurred in a city three hours away from where we live but in the same state (Washington). It is my understanding per state law regardless of whether or not chargers are filed someone must be arrested on domestic violence calls. 

My boyfriend did not assault me, we did get into an alcohol fuel verbal altercation but nothing physical occurred. Nothing like this has ever occurred before or since in the nearly four years we have been together. This incident occurred on a Saturday so he spent the weekend in jail. Monday he was released and they said they were not pursuing charges…. Until six weeks months ago. 

The city re filed charges based on the allegations in the police report. It states he punched, choked, and kicked me. All untrue and did not occur. On Feb 8, 2023 a no contact order was issued. I filed a motion to rescind this order on March 10, 2023 the judge modified the order to allow for electronic communication. I have since filed another motion with a new revised statement.

My boyfriend and I have followed the orders. Earlier today he was offered a plea deal but they are sticking firm on a no contact order between us. I do not want this order nor do I need it. I would like to move back into the home we have shared for three years. I love him and this whole ordeal has caused more turmoil and stress than I endured that night in September. We have another hearing this Monday.

535,"Vague work week hours laws, looking for clarification",11u9n64,"Hello, I work for a manufacturing company in Oregon and am hoping to get a definitive answer from a legal expert in labor law. ORS 652.020 states that no employee in a manufacturing environment may work more than 55 hours in a 7-day work week unless the employee voluntarily signed a waiver allowing them to work a maximum of 60 hours. 

Some people at my company regularly exceed that 60 hour maximum. Our payroll and timekeeping administrator is very good at their job and issues warnings to employees if they exceed 13 hours even by a minute or forget to take an additional required break. 

Given that we have not been warned or reprimanded for exceeding the 60 hours, I'm wondering if it may be possible that they are disregarding breaks & meal periods when calculating the time worked? For example, a 13 hour shift gives four 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute meal periods. So technically only 11.5 hours were ""worked"" in that shift, if that makes sense. You do that Monday through Friday and you've only ""worked"" 57.5 hours, which means you're compliant in not exceeding the 60 hour maximum. It seems like a bit of a gray area and no single person has been able to give me a clear and definitive answer. HR said that 60 is the maximum, and it is stated in the employee handbook.

Months later I start to reapply around March and got hired with my girlfriend for funpix, we both worked there for about 2-3 months until I decided to transfer to security to help my girlfriend get promoted for funpix since they wouldn’t promote either of us and turns out the moment I transferred she immediately got promoted. 

The only issue was the safety team (security). I’ve heard many complaints about the security team but I just ignored it because I really wanted my gf to get hired and they did get paid a little more than any other department. There are 5 tiers for their department and normally takes months to upgrade to the next tier and I was surprisingly promoted fairly quickly, almost within a month to tier 2. Many of the officers there and higher ups complimented me on how a great worker I was and why they really wanted to move me up because I worked super hard. As a couple months go down as a tier 2 unit it was the worse time I’ve had working for cedar fair. A lot of times they threw me on my own to learn and constantly worked me passed my availability which I’ve had before I started working again for the franchise. My availability consisted of not working on Wednesday and Thursday which they’ve made me work plenty of times and I couldn’t work past 6. 

That did not matter what’s so ever in their case. They forced me to work till 11pm, 12pm, and 1 am. I have made many complaints but would always get ignored till one day they threaten to fire me and/or demote me. It caused me to be stressed and mentally drained especially considering how u understaffed we were, not to mention having only 3-5 security officers walking around an amusement park in the heat watching over 20k+ people while also helping (no offense) the numerous amount of careless parents who lose their children from like 3-14. It was a really stressful job and I wasn’t use to it. 

Aside from what my job responsibilities I was just super stressed on how poorly I was treated by the team and yes I did miss out on a couple of days and showed up late because of the fact I had to leave work at 12-1am and come in the very next morning, ALSO working 13-14 hour shifts with no breaks. Which was like once or twice but still. One week I miss 2-3 shifts and was sent to the office and was forced to sign a paper and was demoted back to tier one and that’s when I quit on the spot. 100% why I probably was put on the do not hire list but that also means I can’t apply to any other department, which I’d understand if it was just security but the other 10 departments?? I feel like that’s not fair and it doesn’t sit right with me. They have a history with abusing power, at least that’s what other people told me. 

I went in to try and speak with HR but they wouldn’t let me and said they’ll have a manager give me a call which I think is complete BS , then I asked if there’s a corporate number and they said they don’t know. I really do love working for cedar fair and have created such great experiences for families that come into the park, I’ve even been invited to some families cookouts who live out of state, even super close friends with the “fury guy” awesome dude btw.

I have seen management open the elevator/etc using a FOB, like we've always used to enter/exit. This is just a new one. I would like to have what they have. I do not wish to consent to using this app.

What if we're in the basement parking lot and have no service?

What if we just didn't wish to keep the app open to save battery? (they're literally asking everyone to \*just keep it open\*)

This is a poorly coded app that has had bugs from the very beginning of the implementation, from having to wait a whole half-hour to ""activate"" the lock from their phone, to literally waiting endlessly for the app to just crash. Management has not communicated all of these instances, and I've heard them from neighbors complaining.

545,[FL] Landlord Withheld a Portion of Security Deposit Late and with No Explanation - Do I have a Case?,11u2evo,"This is in Florida.

&#x200B;

I rented for 10 months from a guy who was a first-time landlord and clearly did not read the law at all. I gave him a $2900 security deposit. The house I rented was a new construction and I was the first tenant. He did not provide me with any kind of written notice about how the deposit was stored. I assume he probably stored it in his same personal account that I sent rent checks to.

&#x200B;

Prior to move-out, I cleaned the entire house myself. There were some marks on the walls from furniture, but no holes or other damage that I thought would constitute more than just normal wear-and-tear. Landlord never told me to expect any charges to be taken out of the security deposit. We never did any kind of checklist.

&#x200B;

My lease ended on 1/31, although I turned in the keys a day early, since the landlord already had a new tenant to move in on 2/1 -- which gave the landlord no time to clean or paint in-between.

&#x200B;

I received the security deposit returned to me on 3/17. The check was dated 3/3 and the envelope was stamped 3/13 from the post office. So this is all more than 30 days after my lease ended. He returned $2700, keeping $200 from me. He included no written communication or any explanation as to what the deduction was for. It was literally just as check in an envelope.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, I did not take before-and-after photos to demonstrate the extent of the wear-and-tear. However, he clearly violated the laws around handling the security deposit. I want my $200, but its not a huge sum. I fully intend to reach out to the landlord first, but I wanted to know if I had to sue, would I have a case here?

&#x200B;

Also, I will mention that this guy had me showing the property to the new tenant when it was still under my lease. The landlord lives in NY and this property is in FL, so I was doing him a favor by showing the house. The landlord proceeded to ask me on the phone all sorts of uncomfortable, discriminatory questions about the prospective new tenant's race and how he was dressed (I'm white, new tenant was black, Landlord is pakistani).

555,Risk of eviction due to an Apartment fire.,11u7p9c,"About a few weeks back, an electric grill that my dad uses caught fire in our Apartment. Before it could get any worse, we brought it out into the apartment hallway.

It was put out with no one getting hurt and the most damage being some barely noticeable scorch marks to the tile floor. The Fire Department came and ruled that it was just faulty wiring. Cut to now where we've just received a letter asking for our removal due to the fire. Do they really have grounds to remove us for something out of our control.

556,"I booked a person's return flight impromptu during a trip and then cancelled it after I found out I was lied to. She is threatening to sue, Am I in trouble?",11uh0m1,"Hi there, I am currently in America. A person I was talking to for about 4-5 months romantically who is originally from Canada came to visit me in LA. I had agreed to book her flight to LA and we had agreed that we won't book her return flight yet. The plan was for her to stay here indefinitely and then figure out her return details later. The most explicit thing I said was that if she feels uncomfortable at any moment, she can safely go back and I can take care of that. I said this because she has anxiety, but just to be clear, we were planning on meeting each other for almost two months before that and were into each other. I just didn't want to visit her in Canada because I already did so once and she bailed on me the night we were supposed to meet in her city and didn't come, although she said she was severely anxious that night.

On one drunken night out during the second day she was here, she was being very cold to me, and so the next morning, I asked her what's going on. She told me many things that I did about that night that simply weren't true. I knew that they weren't true but she said I was too drunk to remember. I still gave her the benefit of the doubt even though I was reasonably certain she was wrong. After that, we were completely cool, and she said she was not annoyed at me at all. She then casually mentions how she has to go back to her city the next day because her dog sitter was only dog sitting until then, and then said we had a plan for her to go back on Wednesday. We did not have a plan for her to go back on Wednesday, and she did not mention anything about her dog. The previous day, she even casually mentioned to a friend at the bar that she's staying here indefinitely so now I was 90% sure she was lying. I said we didn't have a plan and she said she did and started yelling at me to book her a flight the next day. Eventually, she started yelling at me to book her a place as well since she didn't want to be around me.

I did end up booking her a place for that day and also impulsively booked her a flight. I was distraught and both of those things were expensive and I was confused as to what was going on but assumed that there may be a misunderstanding and still gave her the benefit of the doubt. After she left, I went to go talk to my friend and hang out with him. I wanted to get my mind off the fact I just had this happen with a girl who I thought would be my girlfriend. We were discussing the details of the night since he was present and that's when I asked if any of what she said was true. He confirmed she was lying. For example, there was a point where she told me that all of my friend's friends found me annoying, but I got my friend to ask them and myself if they did and that was a lie. She also at one point went to do coke with someone and went into the restroom and locked herself with a guy. At this point, I did not know anything about the coke. So I got concerned and started knocking on the restroom. That's when I learned she was doing coke. She told me that I overreacted especially because she and the dude both apparently told me they were going to do coke. But I knew they didn't, and the dude confirmed later on he did not tell me they were going to do coke and that she was lying. At this point, I'm extremely hurt and felt lied to and gaslighted by. She did during the moments when was yelling at me tell me she has a friend in LA and if I don't help her, she can figure stuff out. So because I was hurt and felt like I was being treated as her lapdog, I cancelled the flight by the night. I then texted her and said to get her friend to get her back to Canada after I was angry. She slept early and woke up and saw my text and obviously was very angry. She ended up paying for the flight herself at the airport.

Now, she wants to sue me for the cost of the flight. She said this is a clear cut case and is saying that I should send her the money within the next day. My parents are in Canada and she said the lawsuit will end up at their home. This scares me because my parents are extremely religious and would be hurt by the fact I was even talking to a girl before marriage, much less being in a different city with her.  I am currently in America. She doesn't know my parents or their address so I'm not sure how the lawsuit system works. She also said this is classic fraud and will pursue criminal and fraud charges against me. She also said this is a clear cut case and that she will ensure I'm publicly humiliated if I don't give her the money of the flight since apparently we had a binding agreement. If I am sued, is what she is saying correct? I am currently in California and that is where everything happened.",Separate-Tax7048,5,0,0.33

I'm a 25 year old woman, and I was working at a timeshare company for about 6 months. During Hurricane Ian, both of my worksites were damaged and flooded. I lost my home, my car and most of my possessions. I had asked my director and my manager for a leave of absence so I could move out of state to stay with my girlfriend temporarily, as I had nowhere else to go, and I could no longer get to work.

I was told that I probably wouldn't get a leave of absence, but they'd keep me on the payroll and help me figure something out. 

I moved up to Wisconsin temporarily, and was there for about 4 months. During that 4 months, I qualified for unemployment assistance. About 2 weeks into moving away, I got a phone call from my director that I was being laid off as there was no work for me, and I was too far away to commute to any other sites nearby. 

I stayed on unemployment and kept open communication with the office about how I was looking for work, when I was returning home with my girlfriend and what my situation was.

Everything was fine until recently. I checked the unemployment website, and they said that due to a recent determination, I was receiving benefits I was unqualified for because I had quit my job and lied. Now I owe $1100 dollars back to the state government for fraudulent unemployment benefits.

Mind you, I still don't have a job, I only have a place to live because my girlfriend was able to put money down on a place for us to live, and we are using her car.

I contacted my employer and asked for proof that it was a layoff, and I was told they'd check into it, but it was more than likely a resignation due to relocation.

Is there anything I can do to defend myself and get things turned around?

565,[CA] Can my landlord stay in my house for a week without my permission?,11ssbtx,"I have been renting my house from a family “friend” for the past 9 years. The house belonged to her parents who passed away and she lives out of state. The house is big and in a good neighborhood and she charges me below the average rent for the area. However the house is old, has mold issues, and is full of her parents stuff as she has never gotten around to cleaning it. She would come and stay at the house about 3/4 times a year for a week each time to “clean” (she cleans about an hour for one day and the rest of the time is spent hanging out with friends, family, etc.)

My bf moved in last year and they had a big fight recently and she has told us she wants us out of the house. It’s her house obviously so I told her that’s fine and we’ll be out by end of April. **edited**

She texted me saying she will be visiting and staying at the house during the first week of April to “clean” aka use the house as an airbnb. I don’t want her to come for many reasons. 

1. It’s awkward. 

2. I work nights and she constantly invites her friends and they make a lot of noise during the day. I’ve asked her multiple times to keep it down while I sleep and the request is usually ignored. 

3. She has let two of my cats out on two separate occasions (luckily they found their way home).

4. After never missing a rent check, paying off my previous roommate’s back rent ($2600), paying for my own hotel when the house had termites (I didn’t even get a discount on rent the days the house was unlivable), and various other issues, she implied she will be giving me a bad review if I put her down as a rental referral. 

For all those reasons I do not want to see her or have her in my living space. She however has made it very clear that since she’s charging me below market rent she has the right to do whatever she pleases in her own house.

Before my first day back, I went to visit my coworkers and reminded them again I will be in a boot and be using a knee scooter and they said again that was fine.

So on my first day at work I come in with my boot and a knee scooter since I couldn’t put weight on it for two more days (my foot was unexpectedly worse than the doctor thought). I was there for about 3 hours and was working the entrance door checking memberships when the sales manager told me I couldn’t work in a boot because I was a liability and sent me home and now I have to extend my leave which really sucks cause I don’t get paid til I get back so I have like zero money.

When I was texting some coworkers about this, one of them mentioned that the head of the meat department is currently in a boot and sits down all the time and leaves early all the time because they can’t walk.

Can they legally send me home due to my boot even with a doctor’s paperwork saying I was okay to return to work?",ginabeena,5,1,0.57
569,Maryland (Recording someone at work),11ubedm,"I have a friend who recorded a conversation with his boss several months ago when he started his job.  He was new at the job and recorded his boss interviewing someone as part of the job. He recorded the conversation with the intent of learning the interview process.  He is not 100% sure if he got consent from his boss to record the conversation. He believes he did, but it is not on the recording.  He forgot that he had recorded the conversation; months later, he discovered it and told his boss about it.  

They ended up firing him because of the recorded calls.  They do not have access to the recorded calls.  They only knew about the recorded calls because my friend told them.  

He read stuff online after the fact and now knows it was wrong for him to do it.  How likely is his boss or former employer to pursue legal or civil action? Should he consult a lawyer now or wait it out?

He is nervous, and I would like to provide some insight from someone experienced in this case.  I have read things online that inform us that it is illegal, but I was more interested in whether or not he should be concerned. I appreciate any help you can provide.",Sufficient-Ad-1787,13,0,0.25
570,Neighbor tree dispute,11u5lkj,"NY state.  We recently had a snow storm.  During the storm, a large branch fell off a tree and knocked down a power line leading to a neighbor’s home.  The tree is on my property. The power line was promptly fixed by the local energy company.  My tree branches will sporadically fall onto his property throughout the year, yet, nothing substantial, until now.  I often pick up the branches, break them down and burn them in a fire pit.  There is no damage to his yard or home nor has there ever been.  We’ve been neighbors for over 10 years.  During that time, we’ve had two large trees removed that are close to his property.  On top of that, I attempted to collaborate with him to have a few smaller trees removed but the power lines were in the way.  This is the first time he has lost power due something of this nature.  

Just today, I received a certified letter from the neighbor expressing concern for his safety and the nuisance associated with the trees.  No town/lawyer involvement.  Just a letter from him.

The feedback I’m hoping for is multi-faceted.  Mind you, the trees bordering his property are in good health.  Am I responsible for the upkeep of branches that extend over and/or fall on his property?  Where might the responsibility lie for the trees that are close to the power lines that run to his home and mine?  The lines are about 15-20 feet off the ground and run about 80 feet from the utility pole to our homes.  Should the power company bury the lines or are we responsible for making them free and clear of potential hazards?  Does he have any legal right to enforce trimming of my trees at my expense?  We’ve never had an issue with this neighbor.  He’s in his 80s.  Mows his lawn 2-3x/week.  We’re a busy family that keeps up enough and we don’t feel our upkeep from a general standpoint is an issue.

573,WA Real Estate listing after Death of Seller/Probate,11u57ei," 

I am a real estate agent in WA who had a listing agreement with a seller who passed away around 10 days after listing their home/condo. Sellers Attorney had me cancel the listing, which had an expiration date of Sept 2023.

Originally the PR was sellers close friend, who wanted and also trusted me to relist the home, but attorney convinced friend to have attorney find a PR.

Now 3 months since cancelling listing, I receive notice from sellers friend that PR, who is all the way across the state in Spokane, said that I don't have the credentials to re-list the listing and they want to hire a diff agent and wants the friend to show the agent the property and fill them in on everything. Sellers friend was confused as to why I am not qualified. Sellers friend knew how much time I spent to help the seller move out, fully clean, and prep Sellers home, and thinks I am the right person for the job.

Seller friend is not happy with attorney or PR. Friend mentioned Attorney took a long time to pick a PR, worked very slowly, and still has not sent all the doc or urn to PR. Seller is still paying dues on home and nursing home after death ($7k/month).

**Questions:**

Do I have any rights to that listing? Does Attorney or PR have any fiduciary to uphold Sellers choice of RE Agent?

I don't understand how I am not qualified? Are there certain qualifications required for the RE agent to have to relist the listing? I have been an agent since 2018, in good standing, and lived in the area all my life.

Can PR just pick any random agent to re-list the listing? even though Seller picked and trusted me with their listing.

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated, Thank you.",Onelife888,0,1,1.0
574,Rent mgm issues,11u55tk,"Hey, my co-signer gave notice of moving out to the landlord 1 day after the rent was due and moved out 2 days after that, all without my knowledge, the notice is valid for both of us tho, so I'd have to either move out on April 5th or apply to remove the cosigner, the requirements asked for that to happen will make my application be denied. I don't have the money or credit history to get a new place. The contract says they would start eviction on the 10th and the email from mgmt says they would actually begin the eviction process on the 15th, I paid the rent in full on the 14th.
On the 13th MGM sent an offer to 'incentive to move out' which is if the property is vacated in 15 days they would forego the collections and eviction process (1 more year of contract) and keep the deposit and also send the equivalent to 1 rent to the new address in 10 days because I paid that offer was withdrawn. The early termination offer was 2x rent. The cosigner isn't willing to cooperate at all. So my only option here is to apply for renting on my own (removing the co-singer) 100% certain I'd fail, or move out on April first. This is north Carolina.
I don't have a credit history, I'm short on money. I'm looking for charity help in the city already.

576,[FL] HOA/Property Management shut off my water for over 24 hours,11u4zyx,"I live in a condo that’s run by an (almost nonexistent) HOA and units are bought by different property managements. On Tuesday of March 14th I noticed that my water was not running.

I immediately made an insurance claim with my renters insurance giving them the contact info on the note and (maybe stupidly) messaged the number on the phone that my insurance will handle this.

In the course of three years working at my current company (everyone in the office is white except for one fellow coworker of Asian descent) I have had: 

1. My boss ask if he can call me mulatto
2. An HR who wears shirts with AR-15s (part of the reason why I’ve never come forward with the harassment is because I felt unsafe since it seems she sides with the ideals)
3. This same HR openly asked me in front of my boss if I was pregnant because I requested two weeks of leave for my elopement/honeymoon. I said no and that it was for the occasion listed and then she assured me that I “wasn’t showing”.
4. A higher up and part owner who has rapped lyrics at me and only me in the office (I’m the only black woman)
5. He told me “Happy Kwanzaa or whatever” before leaving for Christmas break 
6. This same higher up/part owner of the company told me that he “can’t say he hasn’t peeked once in awhile” when I told him I was going to the Ladies room (bathroom) when we were alone in the break room
7. When a worker from the warehouse had to leave on an emergency to find his missing family in Somalia because of an incident, our warehouse manager asked what the point of going was because Somalia “was a mess anyways”. 

I have a half of these instances documented in notebooks and text messages but I have not recorded anyone (I didn’t know Minnesota was a one party consent state).

The other day my dog escaped when I was leaving and ran after a person who had just walked by with their dog. My dog ran to the other dog and the owner dropped the leash and both dogs took off. The other dog was really scared and pooped all over itself. My dog did not touch the other dog or person she just barked at them and chased them. I grabbed my dog and profusely apologized and then took her home. 
Yesterday I got a cease and desist letter from the manager saying that a serious incident occurred and I have to stop wantonly disobeying the park rules. It says that I agreed to the park rules when I signed the lease in august of 2013 but this is where it gets weird. I asked for a copy of the rental agreement and the one she gave me isn’t right. I originally lived in one mobile and in august 2013 I moved into a different one but in the same park. She gave me the one I supposedly signed for the new mobile home and the only thing written by me was my signature on one page. Nothing else is filled out or initialed or anything. And it shows it was signed by me and the current manager but she didn’t work here in august of 2013. The old manager was here until she died on October 29 2013. And after she died a higher up from the management company paid me, my mother, and my daughter to clean out her mobile. My mother was the assistant manager at the time and when the higher ups came to her house they had to ask what was going on with the old manager because they didn’t know she was even sick. 
It is impossible for us both to have signed that paper on that date and I’m not sure what to do now. She keeps writing notices for reasons that are unwarranted. She wrote us one to tell us to get rid of a dog that had been gone for 6 months. I told her that my son moved out with his dog and a few weeks later she followed my son from my mobile down to my mothers and when he got out of his truck she asked him if he got rid of his dog yet. Even though she knew he moved out with the dog. 
She writes me notices saying that I can’t park my car in certain spots but let’s other residents park in the same spot. She wrote me a notice to not park in the street but when they have their bingo, art and crafts, potlucks etc., they park in the street for hours. I don’t know what steps to take.

My claim was for reimbursement of expenses on a property I was renovating for a friend, and I had $3,660.46 in legitimate receipts to claim reimbursement for. 

Her ruling, issued one month after the trial ended, was a simple judgment statement with the amount noted: $2,556.90 (with no breakdown of how she reached her judgment.) 

I then asked the court clerk to ask the judge to give me a breakdown of how she came up with the judgment total, since her math wasn’t mathing (my claims worksheet was 3 pages long, and yes, complicated... it was an extensive renovation happening over 3 months during the summer of 2021.)

The following is verbatim from her response to my question for a breakdown on her judgment:

“The small claims officer is not required to provide an explanation of the judgment, however regarding the judgment in this case the following was considered:

1. The limit for monetary award in Arizona, for Small Claims action in Justice of the Peace courts, is $3,000. 
2. While much evidence and many documents were provided by both parties regarding labor, materials, and compensation, the claim and documentation for “supplies” expenses totaling $2,556.90 was clearly documented, and undisputed by either party.

3. While evidence of extensive effort on the part of the plaintiff is clear, proof of contractual obligation by the defendant remains less defined, and plaintiff’s claim for reimbursement of labor costs questions the distinction between labor for hire and labor of love.
4. the court determined that the plaintiff was not entitled for rent monies to be returned, as the plaintiff did reside at the property during the time frame in question. The plaintiff was not entitled to a return of a “deposit” as her departure was premature (reference email 9/29/21) per plaintiff’s own verbal commitment, and the distinction of deposit vs. rent accrued is unclear.”

So, I was confused after I got this response. You see, I didn’t ask for a refund of labor. It was discussed in court totally by the defendant as a reason for not paying me for my expenses since I lived there for a time where rent wasn't paid, but I did not sue for it, and he did not countersue for rent.

I also did not ask for rent monies returned. I paid rent, and lived out that rent for two of the three months I lived on property (his entire defense was I was working for free rent and did not deserve paid rent reimbursement, and that I chose to leave.)

My entire small claims case was receipts for supplies purchased to be used on the property, and other expenses such as the plumber, landscaper and home utilities paid by me on behalf of the property owner during the months it sat vacant while I worked on it. 

And the judge was wrong: the small claims maximum in Coconino County is $3,500, not $3,000 as she notes. All my paperwork from Coconino County, received in September 2022, notes the max is $3,500. I checked to see if the amount increased in 2023, since I did want to sue for labor expenses, and the max amount was not scheduled to increase in 2023.

Is there any way I can ask the court to break down which receipts she was ok with, and which receipts she was not ok with? Because I highly doubt she rejected over $1,100 of proper receipts. And I just feel beat up by all of this.

Thank you.

note: the following may reveal this judge’s name, which goes against one of this sub's rules, but this judge is a public figure in Page, AZ and this is from a local newspaper article from the write-in candidates for JoP in Page this past November.

“I have been an assistant magistrate with the City of Page since 2014. I am entrusted to carry out the duties of the presiding magistrate judge in his absence and on weekends. I have held initial appearances, conducted arraignments and issued sentences. I have signed bench warrants, search warrants and orders of protection. I have also attended the New Judge Orientation, a three-week mandatory training for all incoming judges in Arizona. In August 2022, I was appointed by Coconino County as a justice of the peace pro-tem and have been working at the Page Justice Court. I have been learning the processes and procedures, and have been training under the guidance of various judges from Coconino and Maricopa counties. I am scheduled to be on the bench regularly through December 2022.”

597,Cabinet company giving run around after installing but not completing cabinets - is small claims going to care?,11u2ss7,"We contracted a cabinet company to install cabinets/countertops in our laundry room in June 2022. After removing the old shelving, they installed the majority of the cabinets in September after some backordering delays from their supplier. We gave them 50% upfront and then another 25% of the cost upon delivery of cabinets (per contract). Since September, we have had dozens of communications with them via text, email, and phonecalls asking them to:

* fix the things they messed up (butchered one of the cabinets going in - needs a full replacement)
* install the countertops
* start/complete plumbing for sink area (including installing the sink/faucet)

We cannot get them to come out and finish. It's one excuse after the other (no staff, cabinet is backordered again, replacement cabinet got damaged somehow, countertop prices have changed, etc.). That's WHEN we can get them to respond as they often take to ghosting us for a couple weeks in-between updates. 

We are at our breaking point and have finally decided that they are clearly not going to finish this project for us and that we will hire the remaining work out to another company. 

Currently, we've paid them about 9500, with the total cost being about 12500. Our pricing breakdown they provided us stated that the cabinets themselves cost about 10250. We think that any other cabinet company is going to cost us more than the remaining 3K to finish out the work, but I am worried that small claims court will not help, given that it appears we have paid less than the quote says the cabinets are worth (as in, we have paid 9.5K for 10.25K in value). 

Are we SOL in recovering any damages for non-performance of the contract? Is there anything that can be done through the legal system to recover our time, energy, loss of functional space for nearly a year, etc.?

We had a good conversation, and she had someone remove the limb. At the time I addressed that the tree is beyond saving, and it should probably come down, but she didn’t listen.

It's literally a room with lockers that we access through a keycode door. It's self service so it's not like they r paying for extra help. Oh and the just changes their hours to no one in office just call corporate or make an appt and then they will be there. The carriers r the ones that place the packages in the lockers so their staff literally doesn't even handle them.

603,Job trying to get me to quit to avoid Severance,11u2751,"So my job is based in Ontario, Canada and I have been working from home for the past 3 years. Recently the company has gone under some 'restructuring' due to some negligence that costed the company money and, as the only remaining remote worker, they are attempting to 'pull me back to the office'.

Well when C-19 originally started in 2020, we were told that this would be a permanent position and that working from home for our company was a way of the future, also being told that we were allowed to 'move anywhere in Canada' and still remain employed with them in this role. I ended up taking time off due to C-19 for a brief period and in that period I had moved to a city to be closer to family in case another major medical issue came up. While I was away however, some new managers moved in and began removing certain remote workers due to their own negligence. I, however, remained onboard as I had a top notch track record with the company.

Some attempts were made and failed when they attempted to pull me back about 2 years ago and were unable to due to my location. This was generally accepted and they actually designed a new role around my unique position, justifying financially having a person who remained isolated and remote. My work has always been done to the same high degree of quality and remained so to this day.

Well on Tuesday, about 3 days prior to creating this post, the new structuring occurred once again and I have received a ""return to office"" notice with them citing some contract they have failed to provide to me after requesting a copy for my own references. The company is well aware that my city is roughly a 4-5 hour commute as I would have to take the train, also costing me roughly $200/day in travel expenses at the very cheapest as I would have to ride a commercial train rather than the typical city commute transit due to my location.

It should also be noted that the other position that was created, was signed and dated with a witness as my new job description, of which I have a copy. According to the new acting Supervisor, my job ""is bullshit"" and is ""time killing work"" but my ""real job"" is that of my old position and will not admit that my position is of any legal standing.

It appears that their intention is to force me into a position where if I do not show up for my shifts in an office that is located 4 hours away from me, I will be self-terminating due to ""no show"" negligence.

Note: this job pays < $20/hr but it keeps my roof over my head and yes I am currently looking for new work, but if I willingly quit, I can't claim EI right? Any advice?

It is also non-unionized and my schedule has been changed several times without prior notice, expecting me to change a shift from morning to evening with zero notice. The management team receiving my complaints is also not responding to any of my messages.

Thank you for reading and all help is beyond appreciated!

TL;DR: Job went remote, moved away, signed a new job contract as a remote person, my job falls under a new acting supervisors ""pay umbrella"" and says my new job contract doesn't count. Now they're trying to get me to quit or fire me under the inability to not show up for work.

Edit: Forgot to mention; my usual shifts for the past few months have been a steady sun - thurs 0600 - 1400 Hrs. When my Thursday shift was switched to 1200 - 2200 Hrs. and I told them through several avenues (Calling, email, messaging the main office and letting coworkers know, etc) I was still marked as a ""no-show"" on our clock-in system. I requested this to be fixed several times now and have not seen any fixes.

I was also told that HR would be in touch with me since Tuesday, again on Wednesday and once again on Thursday, but I have not heard anything from them.

I have also been keeping track of all records concerning this matter and creating a paper trail.",OTKFlook,2,0,0.5
604,Cash performance bonus being offered as a vesting agreement,11u23jw,"I'm hoping to get some guidance regarding how I can negotiate a cash performance bonus that is being offered as a vesting agreement on the condition of continued employment. While bonuses aren't explicitly outlined in my compensation package, this feels incredibly predatory and more of a loyalty test than a reward for good performance.

If sharing the exact language used in the offer letter/contract is helpful, let me know in the comments and I can share that as well.

I am familiar with these more common uses for vesting agreements on conditions of continued employment:

* Equity bonuses or refreshes (stock or equity generally have a vesting component)
* Sign on bonus (makes sense that you agree to stay of a certain period of time)
* Relocation packages (must be repaid if you leave before a certain date)
* Payment for continued education like an MBA (must be repaid if you leave before a certain date)

I'm trying to decide if and how I should discuss this with my employer. I'm not super happy at my job, and I would certainly consider leaving for the right opportunity. I'm also concerned that I could be laid off due to economic reasons and would still have to pay back the money, which feels really unfair.

Even if I were to accept the money and slide it into savings just in case, a large chunk would be taken out immediately for taxes right away, meaning I would still have to come up with a few extra thousand dollars to pay them for the privilege of discontinuing employment with them. That's even with a 2-week notice and doing everything the right way.

I'm curious to find out the following:

* What is the breakdown between my bonus for past performance and vesting in my future at the company?
* How does this agreement impact future bonus structures? Is this considered a pre-payment for performance in 2023?
* If this bonus structure is due to having a poor year (as a company) last year, why not structure the payouts differently to help with liquidity? -- not sure if this is the right question, but basically, I want to know if the real reason is that last year we didn't do that well like I was told, but it seems they have the money to do these lump sum payouts.

Overall, it just really rubs me the wrong way. I work in a will-to-work state (if that matters) and any advice, things to ask, or negotiating tactics I should try would be extremely appreciated!",justine_fritz,0,0,0.5
605,Is behavior issues and exs work schedule enough to justify going more custody and potentially changing sons school district? (Me),11u21re,"My ex and I have 50/50 custody of our 5 year old son, with a 2-2-5-5 schedule.

Son started at an elementary school this past fall and has struggled with behavioral issues, he has been placed on an IEP and in his day to day class room setting he is doing great.

The school district son attends is in the town his dad lives in, due to it being much higher quality than where I live. I live about 30 minutes south of where he goes to school, and work 45 minutes south of the school....

Son also attends a before and after care program located right at the school, and lately the behaviors he was exhibiting in the day at school are present at the after care program, *but only on the days his dad is picking up or has dropped off, and it is not carrying over into his classroom.*

On days that I am dropping off and picking up son, we are waking up at 6 am, leaving the house by 6:30, dropped off at 7 am and is picked up no later than 5:45. (I am in the process of searching for a job closer to his school or remote work, with preference to the remote but it is taking time.) Occasionally my fiancé will drop him off or pick him up if he is going to be able to take him a little later, or get to him a little earlier, it just depends as he works as a contractor.

His dad lives 4 minutes from the school.

On days dad is dropping off he is waking son at 5 am, dropping off at 6 am and picking him up at 5:45-6pm. His dad changed jobs, and is now also working as a contractor so the location of his work could change on any given day.

Fiance and I currently rent, and have just signed a lease to move into an area that has a better school district than where son is now.

**Once I find a solution to my work situation, is the behavioral issues coupled with the longer days at school enough justify requesting a  switch to a 70/30 schedule? In general, are cases based on this generally successful? Should I start the process now or wait until we are fully moved into the new place? Will the fact that I rent and his dad owns his home affect anything?**

**I am terrified if I initiate a custody request change I could end up losing time with my son, and it is already so limited.**

In getting more custody. I would have to change his school next year, but I don't think its right that son is spending most of his waking hours in the care of individuals who aren't his parents. I am working on getting son a referral for a behavioral therapist, but sons dad says ""its just a phase"" and ""he has to get used to this, all kids deal being at school that long""..... but its not working for OUR son, and it is beginning to affect his self esteem and socially within the school.

There is alot more to this than just sons behavior that makes me question if 50/50 is what is best for him (lack of parenting/discipline at dads house, dad didn't even know his primary care provider, son coming home with concerning stories and dad introducing son to 3 different new partners in 2 years)

Also, We looked for months in his current district, but nothing has come open that would meet our needs, and had to make a decision on something as fiancé and I are expecting a baby in September and we would have had to take sons playroom away to fit the baby in our current place.",Smart_Number2741,1,1,0.67

Alex moved out in February. For about a year prior, she was in charge of certain utilities. Come to find out, all her accounts have been in the red for the past six months because she hasn't been paying the bills - but she *has* been taking Ray's money for the past six months to cover his share of the bills.

Alex is the primary name on the account and Ray was added, with his name spelled incorrectly, as an authorized secondary. I'm not yet clear on whether that was done with Ray's knowledge or if Alex put his name on there so she'd have a scapegoat for the unpaid bill. Will update when I find out.

I worked at a company for around 1.5 years for their HR department and was a generalist position so I handled things from (relevant to this) employee investigations for not showing up to work to helping deliver  terminations to the employee. 

I received an email from a lawyer who states they are a part of the company’s “Outside Counsel” who mention that they are working on a case brought against my former employer. They stated in the email that they believe I have helpful information to the case. I did not respond to the email and received a follow up email asking for response as well. Did not respond to that either.

I then receive a text message from a former colleague who still works for the employer in the HR department. Their message is essentially can I give you a quick call on behalf of a termination you processed at the company (naming the terminated persons name) and asks me to respond to the lawyers email.

623,Filing a Discrimination Complaint through the Division of Human Rights (New York State),11u09k5,"(I am in New York State): 

Has anyone gone through this system to file a claim of discrimination against an employer?

I was fired last year for what I believe to be discriminatory reasons and I couldn't afford a lawyer, so I filed a claim to DHR.

It's now gone through my complaint > company's rebuttal > my response to their rebuttal. Waiting on seeing if there is probable cause to move forward.

I know the wait could be a bit so I am wondering if I should attempt to save up money for some sort of lawyer if possible on the chance it does move to a public hearing. I know the website says that DHR will provide you with a consultant to present your claim for free if need be, but I don't think they are actual lawyers.

Has anyone gotten to this stage? Is it recommended to have a lawyer? When I was looking around for lawyers before filing on my own, the cheapest I could find was $3000 upfront and I couldn't afford that. I know they would all take a cut of any winnings which I am fine with, it's the upfront fee I couldn't afford.",CaptainFuzzyBootz,0,1,1.0

I specifically selected the building because it had 2 elevators.

Came back from my vacation and has been broken intermittently every day.

628,"Older parents divorcing, dad is a deadbeat trying to get as much as he can",11tzur0,"Hi all,

My parents are going through a divorce, however, it is turning into a hellish situation.

My dad has not been working for about 10 years, my mom has been the one working this entire time and supporting everything (with assistance from me). My dad did not stop working because he was unable to, he made the choice to stop working after he was fired and has basically been a dead beat this whole time. He applied for social security, and has been making less than 20k a year off of that.

He just uses the social security money for his car, food, the phone bill, and that's pretty much it. My mom covers everything else you could think of, and I will assist her from time to time.

After grappling with this issue and all of us trying everything we could to get him back to working, she decided to file for divorce. We live in California, and divorce here based on my rudimentary understanding is you get fucked if you do not have a prenup which she doesn't.

Instead of asking for half of all her assets, he asked her to pay him out 50% of the valuation of our house. Our house is in poor condition, so it's not worth much as of right now (Probably 400-600k and that's being generous on the high end). My mom wants to divorce him, add me to the mortgage, and we will own it together.

The problem is, they still owe 100k on the house (I know, so close to paying it off). Her only option is to re-finance the property, and give him as much as she can. But the way the math comes out, no matter how you slice it…it's not going to be 50% of whatever the house is worth. He's purposely raking her through the mud, so he said ""Figure it out"". She obviously doesn't want to cash in her 401k to give him more money, and she's fed up.

Her lawyer keeps begging her to just settle it with him so it'll be ""easier"", and keeps saying if they go to court there's a chance things can go sideways and the judge will say ""split all the assets in half"". So instead of just owing on the house she'll have to give him half of everything.

Are there no other options? Wouldn't a judge be understanding of her predicament? She has literally paid for everything for 10 years, in my mind he should be grateful he's even walking away with anything.

Ideally we don't want to sell the house, that would be a LAST resort. Thank you for any insight.

Side note: My parents are older, my mom is 68, my dad is 69. My mom wants to retire, and this is dragging it out. Also, people keep saying this isn't my issue...but I live in the house currently with them. So adding that for additional context.

&#x200B;

Edit: My mom IS listening to her lawyer, need to stress this. I am posting this for my own understanding and wanting to seek additional options if there are any, she has accepted her reality. Please note my original question of asking if there are other options, instead of just saying ""She needs to listen to the lawyer"". She is currently doing that.

So mid January I had a coaching session with my manager Ellen so she could find out why I was taking so long to go into available after calls or using the ""personal"" aux. I explained to her that I have really bad anxiety and sometimes I need just a few minutes to talk myself out of an attack. I also have really bad ADD so other times I will forget I'm not in available and it was something I was actively working on. She told me that my coping mechanisms ""were band aids and aren't really working are they?"" She also suggested that if i had a panic attack to just go home for the day when i dont need too i just need time to breathe and dont need to lose out on a whole day of pay. Continuing on, she said that I wasn't allowed to have my coping mechanisms because then other members of the team would ask why I can do stuff they can't. this was all said over an unrecorded teams meeting ao i have 0 record.  So I filed a complaint with HR went through the process of getting medical accommodations and I requested a new manager. I was granted FMLA time but NO one has told me where to go or how to log that time taken despite my multiple requests. They also listed me under a new manager in the system but them made me physically still report to Ellen and the other manager having 0 to do with me at all. Fast forward a bit and my mom passes away. I took my bereavement but working was super difficult and my stats were tanking and I was taking longer on breaks by mistake. 2 weeks after mom i get a formal warning about  this. i sign off and start trying to fix it. I still end up over the next two weeks end up having to take a lot of VTO and paid call offs for mental health so I have BARELY been at work. This past week on Wednesday I get a written final warning for time theft. With 0 room or time to even try and improve from the formal warning. As a result of having to take time off my reliability is at an 80% and i was told if it goes any lower ill be terminated. Now today I have been dealing with severe stomach issues and have been taking periods in the bathroom of 10+ minutes bc I couldnt afford to call off. Ellen has messaged me that I can no longer use the bathroom and that if I need to to call off for the rest of the day and risk getting terminated. 

I would really like to know if I decoded to sue would I have any leg to stand of if I wanted to look into legal action.

639,(US-IL) HOA not allowing internet upgrade,11t70xe,"Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile. 

Just moved into a multi-story condominium for which the HOA has gotten a bulk package internet that is included in our dues. It is only my ISPs base package and is limited to 100Mbps which is not sufficient for my work which requires me to send and receive large amounts of data and hold video conferencing calls internationally with multiple guests. I work from home 2-3 days a week. 

I called the ISP to come and upgrade to gigabit, but they said the wiring is not fit for gigabit speeds, but they could hook up 500Mbps. Not great, not terrible, so I paid for the upgrade which to my surprise was for the entire year and came out to a few hundred dollars. The first technician who came out last week said there were records of upgrading service for other units so it should be a matter of setting up an appointment to access the conduit box and make the upgrade.

FF to today. A second technician comes out and is immediately turned away by our maintenance man. From what I understand, there are 8 connections, 4 are required to be connected from 100Mbps and 500Mbps would require that the remaining 4 are connected. The ISP has stated they will run wire and connect at no charge. The issue is the HOA is adamant that 2 connections be left for an intercom system that goes to the front desk and only to the front desk for which they ask that I buy a land-line phone for that express purpose. The land-line phone will not be able to dial out or receive calls from any other source than the front desk.

I checked my HOA agreement and this is the only language surrounding the intercom and internet:

""-Door Phone Required for Intercom: In order to be contacted by the front desk to be notified of guest or food delivery arrivals, you must plug in a corded phone to the phone jack located in the kitchen. This does not require a paid phone service as it is a direct one-way intercom from the front desk to each unit.
......
Internet service. [ISP for the building] provides internet service as part of your unit's assessment. You should be able to plug your personal router into a connection located in the bedroom or living room. If you would like to upgrade your service to a faster speed, please contact them at (phone number) to set up an account for additional services and/or for service calls. ""

I spoke with the office clerk and the ISP tech today. The ISP showed me in the notes for the building that the company keeps that 500 is possible and has been done, but gigabit isn't. The office clerk confirmed that some have done it before, and they even used to have gigabit access, but they *went in and removed it for the intercom system*(why and wtf?!). I asked her if I could speak to the maintenance man who denied it, she called him, he shouted at her and hung up. I asked for email contact for the board and she said ""If you get in contact with X, he will do everything he can to help you, but if Y(other board member) gets involved, she will absolutely say no.""

I wrote a kind and cordial email to them today explaining that this is a need and not a want and that I would do whatever I can to make as little extra work for them as possible, but I am expecting the worst since it's apparently pretty political within the HOA here.

I looked at Illinois law and the only thing I'm seeing is that the have to power to grant easements for access to internet. My question is what can I do legally if(most likely when) they don't allow me to do change these wires for the internet upgrade? Can I make a case that the verbiage is conflicting or maybe that it doesn't state that I'm limited to internet speeds that will soon become, and in most cases already are, obsolete? Are there any statues that allow them to limit my access to a utility like this?

Most notably, I don't think I actually suffered any damages, but its a shady spot to be in because I can never know if these actions will affect my career.

So, I work for a large defense contractor, Company A. About a month ago a recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn, asking if I would be open to a position at another defense contractor, Company B. I basically said I'm not exactly looking, but always willing to move for the right price. They asked what the right price would be, and after I told them \~30% more than my current salary, they said that it was within budget and asked if they could submit my resume to Company B. I agreed, and quickly got selected for an interview. I interviewed at Company B, and from what I hear they were thrilled with my experience, I would be a perfect fit, and their hiring manager wanted to provide an offer. 

Unfortunately, when the hiring manager looked for approval within senior management (my salary was not exactly cheap), senior management at Company B said there was a non-compete agreement that prevented them from giving me an offer. This was odd to me, because I don't have a non-compete with Company A, and in the recent past I personally know some employees from Company A that have moved to Company B. I asked for more clarification, and was told that it wasn't a legal non-compete, but more of a ""behind closed door handshake deal"" between managers from Company A and B that they would not 'poach' each others' employees. After hearing this, however, Company B decided they would back out of their handshake agreement and after some negotiation presented me with an offer that was \~25% more than my current salary.

Company A has always treated me well, and out of respect for them I reached out to my current manager to inform them of the offer I received. My chat was mostly to say ""Hey, I got this great offer, while I love working for you, I will have a hard time saying no, and I'd like to give you the opportunity to match it (or at least make it more difficult to say no) before I accept"". Obviously my manager had to go to Company A's senior management to get any sort of approval to match the offer, however senior management at Company A knows about the backdoor handshake deal, and were pissed to hear Company B reneging on their deal. Company A calls up Company B, they hash it out, and now Company B says they will respect the handshake deal and rescind their job offer to me.

Now I'm in a bit of an awkward position. Company A, while they are being very kind to me and have explicitly told me they are not upset or angry with me, may have a different outlook on my career. They \*may\* see me as a flight risk, willing to move at a moment's notice should another offer come along. My manager appears to have my back, and he's taking the stance that ""We must have missed the mark on your compensation if other competitors are willing to give you 25% more"", and so they are going to have a salary review meeting on Monday. I may come out ahead and they may offer me more money overall to do the same job. All of that said, all of my leverage is now gone because Company B rescinded their offer, and Company A went out of their way to intercept this and ""force"" it to die. The recruiting company's interference with my career has, in my opinion, negatively affected it, and Company B \*may\* have done irreparable damage, I just don't know if they have yet.

All of this to say - while I don't think anything here is explicitly illegal, it all seems very unethical. I don't know what sort of actions I should take, if any, in order to protect myself in the future.

648,My Sister (83) does not know where original will is. Has a copy of though. Can she sign the copy or update/sign (notarized) - Texas!,11tie9m,"My sister and I are getting our affairs in order. I’m updating my will and I’m wanting to make sure her will is airtight so the house we co-own goes to me upon her death.  She has a copy of the will (well, I do). If we can’t find the original - could she just notate (line thru the COPY stamp and initial, and re-sign and date). And have that notarized to become the official original version of the will. It clearly states the house comes to me. NOTE: there is another sister - I don’t think she would contest the will - but - stuff happens.  I’d like the house no matter what cause I’m going to need to invest in repairs for this old house.  Thanks everyone. It’s just been difficult to get to sleep with this on my mind.  Looking back - I could have had the house willed just to me. But I had seen a lovely family friend cut out of the will where everything went to her brother. It seemed so unfair.  I think I’d still get the house with the the current situation - but it sounds like it’s a good bit more difficult. But it still seems it was the right thing. She deserved to have a home in her name.

650,Capital gains on property left in a trust in Massachusetts,11txlkg,"Looking for some advice in order to make an informed decision. Here is the situation. My grandmother left a house in a trust that my father was able to live in until his death at which time the property would be split between my brother and I. The trustee who is an attorney is refusing to make a decision. My brother wants to buy me out. The property was originally purchased in the mid-1970s, I am unable to find a purchase price. After consulting with a realtor, fair market value is 300 K. My brother has been paying the taxes on the property for the last eight years or so. Property taxes are roughly 4K a year. There have been no improvements made to the property and it is in very bad shape. My brother is claiming that he has 130 K into the property and is offering me 75K as a buyout. He is claiming that if we were to sell the property, after capital gains taxes, we would end up splitting 65K. To note: I don’t believe my brother has paid in 130 K. I believe it’s more in the neighborhood of 60 K. I don’t want to deal with the property, but at the same time I don’t want to get ripped off. Anyone have any ideas on this? I’d really appreciate input from a tax attorney. I’ve already consulted my accountant. Also, wondering what the responsibility is of the trustee.

651,"Employer claims ability to sue me for monetary damages due to education rendered in a state(GA, USA) apprenticeship program",11txjcf,"TL;DR: Can I be sued for monetary damages if I quit with or without notice?

I work at a business that trains its apprentices while paying them an hourly wage. ""Education"" hours are also clocked in paid hours. 

Apprentices are legitimately registered with the state, but still working as full time employees. 

Many apprentices work in the business as fully licensed service providers though they only have apprentice licensing. Their respective registered masters are frequently not present though state rules dictate their direct supervision of apprentices. 

Upon employment, employees sign a contract that they are not given adequate time to read nor are they allowed copies of the contract. 

Often the employees perform apprentice services for the masters and on the clients for a matter of weeks without having yet signed their contract or been issued their apprenticeship license. 

Word of mouth in the business is that after receiving full licensing upon passing the state exam that the employee is required to work there for three years from the date they received their license. I was told upon signing my contract, however, that it is three years from the date of signing. Neither is confirmable because I am unable to access or own a copy of my contract or the employee handbook. 

Can I be sued for monetary damages if I quit with or without notice? Georgia is both an At Will Employment and a Right to Work state, so I don't think that I can, but any legitimate enlightenment on this situation would be incredibly helpful.",tromiway,2,1,1.0

I am a 22yo recent graduate and work in NJ for approximately $15/hr 41 hours a week while looking for another job. I get paid Bi-Weekly and after my check last week, my boss told me that around $150 went missing from the register. He didn’t blame me, and I told him to check the cameras to prove I didn’t take it and he said there would be no need, and he still believed me. About 10 days later and 3 days before I got my check (this Thurs. 03/17) my boss had told me that they are taking the $150 out of my pay check, I didn’t really want to fight it because it was early and I work 11 hour shifts, last thing I wanted was for them to be annoyed at me for 10 more hours so I was stupid and didn’t fight it at the time. Low and behold I get paid and my check was only for $460. Not only do I know they took the $150 but I feel like I should still have gotten paid more than $610 (I took 1 day off, should be worth approx. $165 before tax) 
To my knowledge taking the $150 was illegal itself, but now I am freaking out about other possibly stolen wages. Was it simply legal for them to take the $150? Should I talk to my higher ups about this and risk being fired on the spot or jump directly into legal action? Is there more options I’m missing?

They asked me to cover a show for another host at the last minute. They said the compensation for the show would be $80, due to it being a last-minute request. I did all the work to prepare, set up the show, etc. When I got there it was a complete mess, none of the staff knew anything about it, etc. But I still did all the setup and was ready to go, and hung out for the whole ""shift"". However, no players showed up and there were no games. So the show was effectively ""cancelled"".

I email the host team to tell them about this. They say ""oh well, sorry. We'll give you $15 and call it good. We want you to have 'a little something' for your time.""

Now, I've been a contractor before and I know that in a 1099 situation, it's ""too bad, so sad."" But does the fact that I'm supposedly a W2 employee make any difference here?

Up until recently she was in charge of a different area than mine so she did not directly oversee me. That changed when my manager was fired and his area was given to her. Because of this realignment my company is telling me that it’s a violation of policy and is offering me to step down and take a demotion with a drastic decrease in pay, or I can resign my position with zero compensation. The fact that they asked me to personally resign just isn’t sitting well with me since this is not a choice I’m making on my own. Essentially the company is firing me for a violation of policy that I had no control over. They were also well aware of our relationship and have been for years. The last thing I want to do is jeopardize my wife’s job in any way but I wanted to make sure that I’m not taken advantage of either. Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.

I showed the DMV my buyers order and tax breakdown that showed I had already paid both registration and title, but they said I had to pay again and that the dealer is required to refund me since they shouldn’t have charged me those things in the first place. I told the dealer about this a week ago and they are ignoring my calls and not responding to emails. In total it’s about 400 dollars they owe me.

The blog shows less elaborate recipes than what my business offers.

As it is, I showed him, spent the afternoon there with him in his kitchen (he doesn't actually make the cakes now, he runs the business side of things) and got paid $1,000 for it.

676,Did my boss offer me a fair severance and I should move on after they discriminated against me and fired me or should I involve a lawyer?,11udxbe,"I recently got fired 5 days after my wedding and I believe it was a wrongful termination. 

I have been working from a hybrid schedule for a couple of years. I go into the office on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday while working from home Tuesday and Thursday. I work at a small person company (about 12 people) in California and have full time for about 5 years after a part time gig for about 6 months. I was making about 70k a year. Remote work has been allowed since the pandemic. 

I took Monday off because I got married on Saturday. I was working from home on Tuesday when I received and email from my Boss/CEO stating he wanted me come into the office 5 days a week from now on. I responded that this hybrid schedule has been critical for my professional and mental health and could explain to him why I valued it so much. We agreed over email to meet face to face on Wednesday. 

I go on and work like normal on Wednesday and I meet with my boss and manager. My boss reaffirms he wants to come in everyday. I let him know that I am bipolar and really need the 2 days a week at home for a few reasons, telehealth medical appointment, social anxiety, and concentration. My boss says I should come in every day and do my telehealth appointments from an extra room at work. I explain this will not work because I need to be in a safe space for my therapy appointment and sometimes I cry. I would rather not have the other employees see this. Also, this doesn't really address all my issues. My boss tells me that the energy level on the sales floor is low and he needs all the local people to come into the office. I offer to get a doctor's note and tell the other employees why I would be allowed to work from home if it would help. He asks me at the end of the meeting if these 2 days are really crucial to me and says they will get ""back to me Friday"". 

I work from home Thursday really hard to show I can do it and go into work on Friday. My boss calls me into talk. I walk into his office and my manager is sitting in there. I sit down and my boss says okay we can offer you two options. 1st option is that you start working on a part time basis for a trial period. I am pretty confused and say that I would like to find a way to continue to work full time. I ask them why? My boss says there is no energy when he walks out to the sales floor. It just feels dead out there. I say I don't think it is fair that two other employees with similar roles get to work remote and I can't. My boss states he thinks I should come in everyday and use the extra room for telehealth. I feel like I am talking to a wall at this point and tell them I don't understand this. I just had a great performance review at the end of the year where you called me consistent and now you want me to work part time, is this because of my performance or my disability. 

Saying that made my boss visibly mad. He started almost yelling, ""you no longer work for BLANK COMPANY. You need to leave immediately."" I am in shock but all I say is thank you and shake their hands and leave. 

I get my final paycheck through direct deposit immediately and my boss emails me a paper saying I am fired. He also mentions he wishes to discuss a severance agreement. I wait a few days but finally get it. Basically I say they did nothing wrong by firing me and I get $10,000. 

I feel deep down like I have been wronged and wasn't given the chance really to be heard. They didn't even ask for the doctor's note. I feel bad about accepting the money because then I am legally saying they didn't wrong me and I don't agree with that. I talked to a lawyer who agreed to work on the case on contingency and told me I could make much more than that offer. Is it smart for me to head down this road? 

I have never sued anyone but I am hoping this would just settle. I've been really struggling mentally and recently signed up for some therapy sessions. It really sucks that this also happened right after my wedding. I basically spent most of my life savings on that because my wife and I had stable jobs at the time.

680,Paying Rent on Terminated Lease while Landlord Remodels,11tv67j,"Hello! Seeking advice to see if I have any case or should bother finding a lawyer. Firstly, my lease was intended to be from Dec2022 - Dec2023. I paid an early termination fee, having given them notice in January, to terminate. In my state and in the lease, it states that I am responsible for payments until a tenant is found - ok, understandable. 

HOWEVER, they are asking over $200 more than what I was being charged in rent. Some insight - there is no washer or dryer in the BUILDING, nor is there a dishwasher, parking, etc, and they are asking $1595. They didn't even place a sign outside saying it was available until I asked. But still, alright.

BUT NOW they have decided to remodel the kitchen, having just informed me today (17March). For context, I had moved out 05March. I feel that I should not be responsible for payments at least while they remodel, as no tenant will be able to live there for that time.

I purchased a 2017 Chrysler Pacifica from a local dealer (Jeep, Ram, Chrysler) as well as a warranty through my bank, and the dealership is now telling me it already needs a new engine.  I've probably had the car in my posession for about 5 days in total over the last month, the dealer has had it in their service department for about 2 weeks this time, and before that for about 4 days.  Both times it initially went in because the van wouldn't start, was told it was a starter issue, and then again.  The second time it was there, they were ""being thorough"" and checked it through well and they technician noticed white smoke coming from the exhaust.  Was told it was a bad head gasket and they would need to fix that, but it seems they think the damage was severe enough that the van now needs a new engine.  I know coolant can leak into the pistons and cause all kinds of issues, but this car was suppose to have been inspected already and was good to go, didn't have any issues on the test drive or anything either.  The dealer is now telling me they need to tear the engine apart to see how much damage is really done, and also to submit to the warranty company.  I spoke to the warranty company today and they are telling me that they honestly likely won't cover it as I only just bought the van and if it's wear related, it wouldn't be covered under their policy.  They did tell me if that were the case the would refund the entire amount I paid for the warranty ($4450 through my credit union) so that I could possibly pay for the repairs myself, but that I would then no longer have any coverage as that would just be cancelling the policy and paying it out.  

&#x200B;

That went on much more than I had hoped, and I think may have been less succinct, but It's been a crap day and I've had a few drinks.  I just don't know what to do at this point and if there is anything I can do to fight the dealer over everything.  It was an ""As-is"" car purchase, but I was told that it was inspected, and they did repair a few things before I actually picked up the car.

692,W2 unpaid wages,11tubzj,"This advice is for the state of Iowa.

This is NOT a contract question, but in 2022 I was a salaried employee with a written contract clearly stating my gross wages. Until 2022, I received paystubs with each paycheck. I and other employees requested stubs several times, but was never granted access to a supposed quickbooks account. I am no longer employed there , but after a suspicious W2, I was given permission to speak with the accountant directly because my boss ""had no way of generating stubs"". I was informed they only did bookkeeping and had no idea who ran payroll for my employer. Luckily they were able to give me a spreadsheet containing most of the information I should have been provided bi-weekly.

Problems:

1. Net over-reported on W2 \~$1000. I immediately recognized my W2 didn't match my bank deposits for 2022.
2. Gross under-reported \~$600. This part is rather confusing because my salary and bonuses are not itemized. On pay weeks I did not receive bonuses my gross salary is \~$200 LESS than my contractual bi-weekly gross should be.
3. Bonus confusion - as stated above the spreadsheet did not have paychecks itemized. In addition, it appears the bonuses were lumped into a single month for the entire year which does not match my paper checks I deposited obviously. I don't know if that is illegal, but it sure made understanding it confusing. The bonus may be over-reported which is why my gross is only off by \~$600 from what the correct salaried amount should have been. Again, I can't split up the numbers. It is everything the accountant could provide me.

I have tried talking about this with my former employer, at first only asking if they figured out how to generate pay stubs. It took a lot of badgering to finally be handed off to their accountant who doesn't even run payroll. Trying to keep opinions out of this, but I was told between the time of receiving my W2 and filing the below wage claim with my state department by my former employer that I was overpaid the previous 2 years implying I shouldn't be asking about this discrepancy. I was also told that I should have known what I was being paid the whole year and I shouldn't be bringing it up now. I only knew my net (WHICH DIDN'T CHANGE) in the absence of proper paystubs.

I have also filed a wage claim with my state, but they have informed me that it is beyond their scope, partially due to the time of filing and partially due to the complicated nature of the complaint. **They suggested I might need to seek legal counsel, but I have never hired a lawyer. I assume it will be more expensive than the $1500 difference I am calculating. Do I have any options or do I have to just take my lumps and pay in at tax time due to withholding being lower than they were supposed to be?**

PS the reason my gross was different was that the accountant told me they were only given last year's net and worked backward off of that and my new W-4 with married withholding instead of single resulting in the lower gross total.

693,"Bought a ""orginal stock/non modified"" Subaru Legacy with an pre-purchase inspection and I find out after the fact it was engine swapped.",11tu82t,"I recently bought a car out of state, which I had been searching for quite some time due to the car being kinda rare. I had the seller get a pre-purchase inspection (PPI) since I was out of state, which came back clean and showed that the car was stock with no issues. However, when I took the car to my mechanic for some fluid changes a few weeks later, he discovered that the car had a different engine in it than the original one.

The car I bought is a Subaru Legacy with an EJ255 2.5L Boxer 4 motor, but the engine swapped in was an EJ20X 2.0L Boxer 4 motor, which is not the original engine and comes from Japan. The engine swap is typically done when the original engine blows and a replacement is needed, as the EJ20X is much cheaper than a new EJ255.

I bought the car expecting it to be completely stock with only 95k miles on it, and I was assured by the seller that it was all original. I only found out about the engine swap after I bought the car and took it to my mechanic.

This also wasn't just a regular mechanic who doesn't know and could have missed it. They claim to be a Subaru performance shop and theres several signs that stand out telling you its not the right motor (Unplugged connections, a stamp in the engine block saying ""EJ20"" when it should say ""EJ25"", a label on the timing cover gasket saying the engine model and bulges from the engine in spots that the original motor wouldn't bulge out).

I have been trying to contact both the shop that did the PPI and the previous owner, but I have not had any luck. I am not sure if the car's engine mapping has been updated to account for the different engine, and I am also unsure if the necessary parts were swapped out during the engine swap to make it work properly.

It appears that the previous owner bought the car with a blown engine and did a cheap engine swap before selling it to me. The car was registered by the guy I bought it from on 12/12/22 and only 46 miles less than before I bought it.

I paid $12,500 for the car, with $500 sent through Venmo as a deposit (which I have buyer protection for). I am wondering if there is anything I can do to get my money back, or if I am out of luck. Should I try to go through Venmo to get my deposit back?

The car was inspected on 12/30/22, I bought it on 1/06/23, and my mechanic found the different engine on 01/27/23.

697,Seeking Legal Advice for Friend in Divorce,11ttvg5,"I have a close friend who is in the middle of a nasty divorce. Her estranged husband of almost a decade left her for her best friend. After separation and prior to divorce filing, she left their home and moved in with her parents, leaving him with the house and the car. At this time, he was working a solid job and he DOES want to be a present father to his children (two children 6/3years.)

She was a stay at home mother the entire marriage, as he was very adamant about a nuclear family of him working and her raising the children, despite her voicing concerns about her desire to work and find individuality. Now it's been 6 months, divorce has been filed and she has had legal representation the whole time. She was informed this morning that he has now lawyered up. 

She's not asking for the house, or the car, or full custody. She is fine with him taking all of it, and settling with full joint custody including working out stipulations so neither have to pay support, both will claim taxes alternating, both will pay for the children's schooling. All she wants is for him to settle her a cut of his 401K, so she can start her life over and not have to start from absolutely nothing, in so many words homeless (living with her parents.)

My question is: Is there any basis for her to be granted what she's asking for? If not, what should she fight for? Mind you, he's now currently unemployed, house payment is behind and he was denied a refinance on the auto. She's so scared she gave him everything for the sake of the kids and now she will have nothing.

701,"Fired in a ""Right To Work"" State, however, employer was potentially in breach of contract. Advice?",11ue340,"So my wife out of the blue was fired from her job as a team leader in a small company in a state with ""Right To Work"" employment laws. Her employer has been largely absent during the entirety of her employment, rarely ever responding to emails, repeatedly cancelling meetings within minutes of their start times, often deferring his responsibilities to underlings, offering nothing in the way of guidance, and pretty much leaving her to fend for herself in terms of establishing what the exact parameters and responsibilities of her position even were. Mind you, this is a company that goes overboard in publicly decrying how transparent, open, and respectful it is to workers.

Last week she sends an email to her boss praising the company on the whole, but in lieu of any sort of meetings or reliable correspondence, includes a detailed list of issues that she thought merited attention. His initial response is one of appreciation and thanks for making the effort to bring these things to his attention, a week goes by with no other communication, and then this morning she's terminated. Via email.

The reasoning he offered was...well...hard to define. The termination email was a screed of often contradictory paragraphs, praising her for certain behavior in one instance and then condemning her for the same behavior in another. In short I think she was fired because she wasn't doing her job to his wholly undefined expectations. She was never warned or reprimanded, and was only ever informed of her supposed short-comings in her termination email. 

This is where the iron sharpens the iron.

She'd only been there for about two months, within the 90-day probationary period defined on her hiring contract. However, the clause on the contract that defines the probationary period states the following, ""During this time you will receive guidance to help you become familiar with, and competent in, performing the work you have been appointed to do.""

If her immediate superior is the one that is responsible for providing ""guidance"" and so on, basically does NOTHING to train her or provide said guidance, (the proof of which is contained within numerous emails, texts, Slack channels, etc) and then fires her for supposedly not doing the job to his liking, is he potentially in breach of contract?

705,Woman I was dating is pregnant and ghosting me,11u597x,"I'll try to keep it simple.

Girl and I were dating, we broke up.  She tells me a week later that she is pregnant.  It's tough but we decide not to keep it.  I send her the money for the pill which she is supposed to be taking Saturday.  I offer to be there with her through the process, seems like the least I can do.  Today she ghosts me, and I don't know what I should do in response.  

I know this happens a lot in the opposite direction, and there's articles and all kinds of information on google about that....but I haven't found anything that is helpful online for my situation.

Like what does this even mean for me?  I can't know now whether or not she is going to actually terminate the pregnancy and I'm concerned that it will end up being a surprise in 9 months when I get served with a request for child support.  

It's also possible that she does follow through with it and I just never hear from her again.

I hadn't considered this option until now, but it could even be possible that she lied to me and just took the money.

I'm freaking out because I can't know for certain and I was trying to do the right thing.  I told her what my thoughts were on the situation and she seemed to agree with it.  I repeatedly told her when asked (and have the texts to prove it) that I wasn't going to pressure her into it.  She has 3 kids already and I really don't think she wants another one given her situation, but I am still freaking out not knowing.",kajidourden,7,0,0.3
706,My employer descriminated against me to assert power then bribed me to not quit. TW SA,11u75u1,"The title is a very shorted version of events. I don't post a lot on reddit but I really need help as I'm ready to leave this job now. I'll try to be as specific about what happened and location without revealing either party.  
I live and work in Corvallis, Oregon, USA  
This job is in child care.  
At the time of the initial event I was in a very abusive relationships which is why I did not leave my job at the time.  
In Augest of 2022, I was moved to a new location with more staff and longer hours. Was great, was meeting new people, thought I was making friends. I had a coworker I was getting close with. I have severe PTSD and they wanted me to talk about it.  So I upon them pushing me confided that I'm a survivor of SA. This conversation happened outside of work.   
A few days later I got called into a metting with a manager who already didn't like me because I got offended when they called me a liar. So in this meeting I was accused of making my coworkers uncomfortable. Basically I was accused of harrassment. They pushed me to confess but I had no idea what they were talking about. No write up, no documentation of any kind. Just two managers writing my responses, as I'm in tears at their accusations so confused. Being told to just own up to it but them not directly saying what to own up to. It ends with being put on forced leave for a few days. I was also told not to talk to anyone while I'm gone.   
I come back from the forced leave and go to have a meeting with that same manager. They look at me and ask if I feel better, if I'm rested. I told them no, you said to think about every single thing I ever said in and out of work to co-workers. I did not rest. You put me on edge and caused me severe anxiety. I then proceeded to announce my resignation, if I'm ""harrassing"" people and making co-workers uncomfortable, I'll leave. Everyone deserves a healthy work enviorment, so if I'm the problem I'll leave. They responded to that by begging me to not leave, and confessed to lying about me doing anything wrong. That I just looked stressed but because of my work ethic if I was asked to take time to relax I would say no to just do more work. A different manager who had worked with me a lot was in this meeting and told me they would pay me for my forced leave and that this tactic used by the other manager was not okay, they apologized. I was begged to stay and do my shift that day, which I did. With more tears. I was also told not to tell people I'm a SA survivor. That even when giving people TW and asking for permission to share my trauma, I never should. People lie and say they are comfortable with things even when they aren't so I'm not allowed to talk to co-workers anymore.   
A few weeks later was time to renew contracts and I turned them down, until I was offered a promotion which would get me away from the manager who pulled this stunt on me.   
Then in Feburary that managers father came to my site to have a meeting with me, saying a client saw a scar on my arm during a transaction, and emailed him about it. So he wanted to know if I was okay, then dropped the news he wants me to work directly under him in a new posistion, which I thought was a promotion, but it was a if you don't take this job I'll fire you.   
I'm no longer in my abusive relationship. I'm now okay and plan on leaving this job. I forcing employees to take leave due to mental health violates the equal employment act. Does this behavior count as workplace harrassment? If so what steps can I take now? This is my first job outside of family, in a field I'm very passionate in. I'm afraid of retaliation for reporting them to the Oregon Labor Board for discrimination. The enviorment is also just in general toxic enough that I have to hide my gender identity at work. I feel extremely uncomfortable, I talk as little as possible to other co-workers. We just had a director change because the old one gave employees ""Hope"", is a quote from the COO (Cheif operating officer).",professor_allen,1,0,0.14
707,House Inheritance Gone Bad,11suc0i,"tl;dr I helped my parents with the majority of the downpayment on their house a long time ago with the understanding that I would stand to inherit the house one day, and recently learned they have cut me out of their wills.

Details:

In 2005, when I was 19 years old, I helped my dad and stepmom purchase a house.  The three of us were living together in a rental before that. My parents could not afford a down payment on their own, and I had $35K from an inheritance from my maternal grandmother.  I allowed this 35K to be used to cover a little bit over half of the down payment (they put up about 30K).  The rest of the ~$325K home purchase was from a mortgage my parents took out.   My name was not on the deed or the mortgage.   My stepmom was against the idea of including me on the deed so I didn't press the issue at the time.  There was no written agreement for the money that I provided, but it was verbally understood that I was a silent partner and would stand to inherit the house in the future.  I never considered the money to be an unconditional gift as I expected the house to be mine at some point.

I lived in the house with my parents during college breaks and summers, and then moved out on my own shortly after graduating.  Years later I got married and moved to another state. In 2014, I had a falling out with my parents and communication with them ceased.

My dad passed away recently and I just received a copy of his will, in which I was explicitly cut-out from being a beneficiary.  My cousins are now listed as the beneficiaries if both my parents were to pass.   The copy of the will I received was dated 2020, and I believe it is likely that earlier versions would have had me listed as being the beneficiary to receive the house if both my parents passed.

My stepmom is still alive and living in the house.  It is likely that she has also cut me out of her will, and that my parents intentionally violated our prior understanding.  Reflecting on the situation, I feel they took advantage of my generosity and did not follow through on their promise.

Do I have a case that is worth pursuing with an attorney?   Would my claim be for a majority equity interest in the house, or would I be limited to requesting some kind of monetary payment, like repayment of the 35K plus interest, as if it were a loan?  Would I be filing a claim against my dad's estate, or would this be a direct action against my stepmom since she is now the sole owner of the house?   Any general advice on if I have a good case or how to approach this situation is appreciated.",Schmoopea,35,99,0.91
708,I just had a job offer recinded and don't know where I stand legally,11tsdd7,"Hi I am based in the UK and I would like to know where I stand legally in this situation. I received a job offer by email today. After being told by the interviewer that he would be ""very surprised if I didn't get the job"" I was informed there were 5 positions available. 
I informed my homelessness team and my job advisor that I had been offered a job.
Then just a few minutes ago I received a phone call telling me there had been a mix up and a different person who shares my first name was actually hired, not me. She went on to tell me that there was only one position as the others had been filled yesterday (complete lie as they only finished interviewing this morning and I was told the wouldn't offer anyone jobs until after the interviews were all over) 
I am a wheelchair user and I think that they changed their minds after realising this and made up this excuse to cover their own backs. I have asked them to email me so that I have their excuse in writing. But do I stand anywhere legally with this (say if they are lying and didn't hire someone with the same name today) 

Can anyone help as I don't know where to go from here. I am totally humiliated. I told my freinds and family, I told my homelessness advisor and job coach. I was so excited and it's just been ripped from me. Please help if you can.

712,How do I go about getting a new lawyer?,11tku6c,"I hired a lawyer in September of 2022 (I know that’s not super long) regarding workplace harassment/wrongful termination. 

I have sent her everything she needs/asks for within a day of her asking, aside from ONE time recently while I was visiting my best friend and took a few extra days to respond

She didn’t say a word to me from December 23 to February 1st. I emailed twice, called the office countless times only to be routed through a phone system to actual endless ringing. I emailed the first lawyer I had been in contact with, who consulted with me about my case before determining it could require legal action, the one who ended up sending me to a partner firm and thus this lawyer. Which I feel bad about, he’s not my lawyer, it’s not his fault, or his job to be like “why are you not taking care of this client.”

I finally got ahold of her assistant the next day, and was told I wasn’t forgotten about! Yay! I truly am not trying to come across snippy in this post, in reality I am sitting here thinking about how she probably has so many other clients and while my case is my priority, she has dozens. I have happily been walked over because I let this shit roll off my back, i know she has other shit going on! Plus it was the start of the New Year. So that’s how I justified it to myself. 

I was told before the new year that we had plenty of time for claims. Except that time is dwindling and I haven’t heard a proper update from her since mid February. The formal demand she’d made so much progress on in mid February, which she’d said the first draft would’ve been ready the next week for me to to read and approve, that she asked me for info for in, has not reached my email. And now It’s been 2 weeks since any word at all. 

At what point do I say that I am not receiving the service I need? What is the process for going to another lawyer? Would anyone even be ok talking to me if I have a lawyer already? I’ve been wanting to reach out to other lawyers about their services but would they be willing?? How do I say that I will be seeking counsel elsewhere as this is not working for me? I had a friend go through a lawsuit who said her lawyer was constantly updating her and I’m sitting here begging for an update and getting it over a week (OR MORE) later.

714,Medical Saga after root canal-next potential legal steps?,11trzp2,"2 months ago I went to the dentist who let me know I may have an infection on tooth 13. It wasn't causing pain however I went to see an endodontist anyway to see their thoughts. They said I would need a retreatment of an old root canal. They did the retreatment then used my old crown and recapped the tooth, prescribed antibiotics and sent me on my way. Within 2 days I was in excruciating pain, pressure and pain in tooth and excruciating non stop headaches. This continued for 2 weeks. In this 2 weeks time, I returned to the endodontist 3 times and they prescribed pain killers and steroids. Told me my pain was a flare up and sometimes flare ups last a while (this had been 12 days). Then after 2 weeks I woke up with my left side of my face swollen. I went back to the endodontist and they told me I most likely had a vertical root fracture (they couldn't see it but said it must be it) and would have to get oral surgery. I had emergency tooth extraction that day. I then ended up in the ER 2 hours later due to fever and vomiting. In the ER they let me know the infection had spread to my maxillary sinus and that I had an  oral antral fistula. They prescribed antibiotics. Since then I have seen neurologist, acupuncturists, chiropractors, botox treatments and in care with an ENT. I have had 3 rounds of antibiotics. I am still with horrible non-stop headaches and also now have TMJD. I am scheduled for sinus surgery in 2 weeks and hoping that will help me. If not next step is a pain clinic for a nerve block per my ENT and neurologist. I can't help but think the after care from my endodontist made the infection worse (2 rounds of steroids) or didn't follow proper after care (more imaging due to extent of pain and length of pain).

716,HOA asking for social security number in application,11trp5o,"In the process of buying. HOA management company changed during closing process.

We did not receive the governing documents at any stage. We have asked for them from the new management company but have not received them.

We are past the appraisal, and have now heard that we must apply and be approved to the HOA. In the original disclosure, we were told we would not have to be approved.

I know this seems like it's maybe not worth even fighting over, but the new HOA application is asking for our SSNs and DL numbers. We have to send the application by mail because the management shift is so new. So I would be providing my SSN over paper... I called to inquire about this, they basically said yes we need it, but they could make the process more ""secure"" for me by taking it over the phone, and then shredding the paper they wrote it down on.

So, do I have any recourse? Can they really force us to provide this sensitive of info? Can I get out of this closing process due to this? We have 20K in escrow, and I guess if it's between losing that or providing my SSN I'll provide the SSN...

717,"[OHIO] My roommate is consistently paying rent late, costing me overdraft fees when rent comes around. Can I sue him for this?",11trmzb,"Hi there, r/legaladvice

My roommate consistently pays rent late, causing me to be charged overdraft fees. Without his share, I often end up a couple hundred dollars in the negative for a few days, and can sustain up to $30-$60 in overdraft fees during that time, which he does not assist in paying for.

I have no desire to rectify this situation. This is how it's been for the entire duration of our lease, and he is refusing to let me find a replacement for myself and exit the lease. On top of some pretty immense personal disdain and harassment from him, I'd like to just have some ammunition when I reapproach him about letting me move out.

718,"(US-FL) xpost from r/securityguards, Will I lose my license *or be arrested* if I don't return a uniform that I took a paycheck deduction for?",11t68n2,"[In this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/securityguards/comments/10ry934/will_i_lose_my_license_if_i_dont_return_a_uniform/) in [r/securityguards](https://www.reddit.com/r/securityguards/) about a month ago I asked around for perspective about my paid-for security officer uniform that my former employer (based in FL) was threatening legal action for. I since explained that I didn't believe I was liable for the administrative actions that he was threatening as the uniforms were paid through paycheck deductions, but that I would still be willing to return the uniform, and after I suggested that I could give it to one of his staff members in the city I work in or meet up in another time or location or means, he threatened that I will be charged with trespassing if I attempted to return to my former job site and reiterated his demand that they be returned 9am-2pm, Monday-Thursday (which wasn't even their full office hours). As well as sending my girlfriend and I a slew of other unprofessional texts/emails.

My understanding was that I only needed to return **company-owned** property which I had read the Florida security officers guide book and the company's policy manual. However Florida Statute 493.6305 specifies ""Upon resignation or termination of employment, a Class “D” licensee shall immediately return to the employer any uniform and any other equipment issued to her or him by the employer."", with no reference to ownership so I figured maybe he's right after all depending on what he means by ""issued"".

Now he's demanding the uniforms again a month later, attached with an attorney's letter, stating that I have 2 days to return it. I haven't received the letter yet, just a personal email along with it, claiming I stole the uniform and that he'll get a warrant out for my arrest, which I guess isn't crazy if it's a violation of 493.6305(1), it's potentially a misdemeanor as per 493.6120(3), I didn't even want to keep this shit, I would've shipped it off a month ago but he demanded that I gave it in person.

I called half a dozen attorneys. Either they wouldn't give me straight answers on what I should do, or they said it would be over a week for a consultation, or they said they don't specialize in this and referred me to some public service number to find an attorney, that only put out busy tones.

I rented a room out to a college student in my 3 bedroom house. The lease was dated for 8/10/2022 until 03/01/2022 (I messed up on the lease agreement and obviously meant to have the end date as 03/01/2023).
On 10/18/2022, the tenant told me in person that she intended to move out but wanted to wait until I found a replacement tenant. I agreed. 3 days later on 10/21/2023, the tenant informs me that she will be moving out November 1st and says she hopes this doesn’t put me in a bad spot. (Which it obviously does) 
The conversation for the next week is very minimal as I am very upset and would just like her gone but after moving out she begins to demand her deposit back. I inform her that if I am able to get a tenant in the days between 11/1 and 12/1 then I can return partial payment. On 12/5 she messages me asking for her deposit but I state that I didn’t find a tenant and she will not be getting her deposit back. 
Fast forward to now, 3/16 I receive a legal style email stating how she didn’t break the lease and demanding the deposit back. I can attach her letter and also the lease if needed.

My friend is a teacher at a private boarding school. They have had trouble retaining staff and several teachers leave midyear each year. My friend sent me a screenshot of her contract for next year, which included this paragraph:

“I acknowledge that the school and its students may be disadvantaged if I resign during the school year and I agree to pay the school, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, a sum equal to ten percent of my annualized salary within 30 days of my resignation, which shall assist the school in obtaining short term relief for any unanticipated expenses precipitated by my resignation.”

733,adding a member to my LLC in NY State,11tqdl0," Hi,  
I recently formed an LLC in NY state (not the city), the intent was always to be me and my wife in this LLC 50-50 , when I formed it the secretary of state website only asked about the structure of the LLC and I made it one or more members, it doesn't ask to provide members names.

Now, how can I have my wife as a member, is it only by having an internal operating agreement? I mean that part i know but am just not convinced that is the only thing required, I thought there must be something we should file to enforce this operating agreement.

Can you please verify this for me, do I add my wife as a member by only having the internal operating agreement and we each keep a copy, and that's it? or do we file something.

Some websites say I need to file an Amendment, but the problem is that NY Amendments for LLc's only change certain articles and doesn't allow to add members' names per se. 

My wife trusts me but I hate telling her that she only needs to keep this document with her and thats it without filing anything with the state.",trying_ashardasican,0,1,1.0
734,Is Street Parking Without a Permit A Valid Defense Against an Insurance Claim?,11u05su,Person A was parked on the street at night without a permit (no other street parking restrictions or signs suggesting you cannot park there) and then that vehicle was struck by another vehicle (Person B). Person A was not in the vehicle at the time of the incident. Person A's car was totaled. Person A's insurance goes after Person B's insurance to be made whole - does Person B's insurance have a defense that Person A illegally parked on the street therefore they will not settle the claim? Assume strong evidence of the incident that Person B undoubtedly struck Person A's vehicle. Police report is silent on the legality of the parking itself. This is a city street surrounded by apartments where it is very common to park overnight. This is Wisconsin. Does the lack of an overnight permit matter in regards to settling the claim and Person A being made whole?,badgertz,7,0,0.2
735,employer illegally demoted me due to my medical issues,11u02w1,"hello, im posting in this thread because i feel i was wrongfully and illegally demoted in my workplace and want to know if i have a case and how to proceed with it if i do. i am a 20f and i worked at a smoothie franchise for just about two years. i got a promotion about a year into working there and everything was great. my gm and dm both were very fond of me and i considered my gm to be a close friend of mine. well this is where it starts, something happened between my dm and the company where they cut his pay by half of what it used to be, forcing him to quit. i don’t blame him as i wouldn’t want to do the same work for less money. they then hired a new dm who i tried to be nice to whenever i met him and he came to my store and i thought we were cool. flash forward a month or two i get very sick, in and out of the hospital sick(gi issues, bms with blood, severe weight loss, etc) and i have had to call out of work for just about two weeks for these issues. i finally returned to do a 4 hour closing shift where i was still not well but i needed money because i was out of sick time so i took on a smaller shift wore a mask and went to take breaks as needed because i did not have all my strength back. at the end of that shift i forget to count the drawers which i understand was not a good thing to do but it completely slipped my mind as i was thinking about my recovery process and haven’t been to work in two weeks. i have had no prior incidents before that and no prior write ups, the work place went very smoothly before i got sick. anyways, about two shifts later i was doing an open and i was having very severe back pain which later i found out was from pneumonia and my gm came in and told me she needed to talk to me. i was already on the verge of tears from the pain in my back that my coworker saw and could vouch for me, but my gm sat me down and told me new dm has made the decision to demote me over not counting the drawers and sitting down too much. i told her i didn’t think that was fair as i was still sick when i worked that shift, i needed to be able to sit down, and haven’t been in my work routine for two weeks. she told me she understands and that it wasn’t her decision and she was upset she was the one who had to tell me and not new dm. i responded with something along the lines of “i feel like that should be a write up and not a whole demotion” and she agreed but she said again it wasn’t her decision and there was nothing she could do about it. she saw how upset i was and asked if i would like to leave early that day which i did. my demotion didn’t officially happen until january 3rd 2023 because i put my two weeks in before the demotion would be official so i would just finish my time there still getting the dollar of extra pay i made as a manager. fast forward to about a month later im still dealing with these same medical issues and have gone back to the hospital around 4 more times. im laying in bed and i googled if it was illegal to demote someone due to medicals issues which i found out it indeed was. so now i’m posting this just to see if anyone on here could give me some legal advice on if i have a case and how to proceed with it. thank you for stopping to give this a read.",reinalynee,3,0,0.33
736,My job is threatening to fire me over a raise,11twasu,"Hello to all the people here. I right now work for a used car dealership of 28 people not including myself. When I first joined in March of 2022 I was promised a raise in 3 months. 3 months came and went and I asked about it. I was then told it would be at the start of 2023. January came and went and I asked again. They then told me I need to create a list that shows what I do for the company along with what I would want for pay. I did so March 10th. They told me they would meet with me this week to discuss it. Today I was told that I am going to be fired if I ask about it again and that I am not getting any sort of raise. 

Some information to add, I was hired as an Automotive Lube Tech at $16 per hour. I am located on Carmel, IN. I now do Electrical Diagnosis and Electrical Repair on Vehicles. I also do Minor Tear downs including suspension and motor. I also now do the maintenance on the building. I rewired a set of lights for the sales side, and I just completed running the Air lines for the service side. I believe at least $20 an hour is what I'm worth.

Can a judge waive these fees for me? Probation officer says no, I gotta pay it. But I feel like a lawyer might disagree. I can't afford a lawyer and besides the lawyer will probably end up charging more than the $2,000 I owe anyways just to help me file and stuff.

744,Do I have a case?,11tuoa5,"Hello, I’m a 21yo M this is my first time posting and I’m coming onto here to talk about a situation I’m dealing with and I’m wondering if I had any legal case.

So first off I’m on a college basketball team, we’re filled with mostly international students. This last preseason a new kid came (NK) to our school and showed interest in playing for our team. Me and my roommate (RM) instantly started becoming friends with him and he soon joined the team after my roommate talked to our coach. It started off good we hung out all the time, he was quirky and said some wired things sometimes but nothing alarming. Some info about NK is he’s a pansexual male.

One day about 4 games into the season he decides to take a full 180. He came over one day and insisted that my RM (a very traditional male) asked him to suck his dick and NK kept pushing onto him making RM very uncomfortable. He immediately texted me begging me to come back to the room so he wasn’t alone. I was in the middle of a date with my GF of 3 years so he had another one of our friends come over so he wasn’t alone. RM was very respectful telling him absolutely not and even let him finish hanging out with us. Shortly after I came back not knowing what’s  happened I just started hanging with all them but NK was very touchy and it warning because previously any time we even tapped him NK freaked out. After learning this I was flabbergasted but it did answer some of my questions about why he was acting that way. When he left we decided that he’s not aloud to come over anymore. After that he came over every day multiple times a day trying to talk to RM. Every time I would answer the door and say he does not want to talk to you go away and don’t come back. He then started writing notes to him, 2 to be specific 1 we threw away and 1 we kept.

For the next few days nothing happened but after 3-4 days NK started talking to a teammate of our and said 1. RM did in fact ask for that 
2. They hooked up that night and 3. That he fucked his ear. Our teammate is very good friends with us and told us immediately. RM was furious and that day he messaged NK telling him to come over and talk. Me and RM knew that NK was a liar and manipulator so he had my GF hide in the room and me in the room. I then decided that 2 people weren’t enough so I clicked record on my phone. NK did not know about the recording or my GF being present. He admitted that night he’s a pathological liar and everything he said was false. And we thought that was the end of it.

But it wasn’t, a few weeks after NK found a new group of friends coincidently these new friends were my GF’s roommates. And one day just a little after the middle of the season GF and her roommate were talking and the situation with NK and RM came up and this really rattled my GF’s roommate because NK told her than ME AND RM raped him. He didn’t only tell my GF’s roommate, he also told many of my teammates about this. 

I immediately went to my coach and reported it. He sent me to the dean of my school to make a report. I didn’t want to ruin anyones lives so I said let’s just talk to NK and hope that he stops. He didn’t in fact he doubled down (not to the dean) and told even more people about it and on top of that that most of the basketball team is gay and they all came onto him. We in fact have 1 gay person that is known on the team. 

So what can I do? NK has proven he won’t stop lying and slandering me and RMs names. This is a serious accusation and it has made my life hard and a lot more stressful. I have that video and the letter as my only concrete evidence, everything else comes from peoples testimony. Do I have a slander law suit case? Is their anything else i can do?

749,ADA Question - Autistic - Work refusing to provide reasonable accommodation,11u3j5k,"I started working at my current job in 2017, in 2019 I started a new position. Around this time, I had a situation of severe emotional distress and I tried to commit myself in the hospital. They didn't accept me for whatever reason but none the less, I was in severe emotional distress. In mid 2020, I was allowed to work from home due to COVID. I worked from home until December 31, 2021. My mental state was pretty decent throughout this time given the situation. Between January 1, 2022 and present I've been working in the office. In May 2022, I committed myself to the hospital for emotional distress. Every 2 weeks or so I have to call into work from the stress and emotional/physical discomfort that I experience from working in the office. Throughout any given week, I get migraines and general emotional/physically exhausted. When I say exhausted, I mean I will go home from work, immediately lay in bed, cover myself with a blanket, and pretend I don't exist until I have to wake up the next day for work. I literally spend the entire weekend recovering from the work week and a single weekend is not sufficient to recovery, which is why I end up taking a day or two off every few weeks. Since that time, I've learned that I'm autistic with sensory sensitivities. How I didn't realize until now, I have no clue, nevertheless, I feel incredible stress from things like cold air on my legs and arms, I have auditory sensitivities, and my eyes are very sensitive to light. I've began wearing tall socks and a cardigan, which has helped the sensitivity on my skin. I bought sound proof headphones that I wear almost constantly at work, this has significantly helped. I bought a pair of prescription sunglasses and I wear these constantly at work. This has made a difference, but has not significantly helped. Towards the end of any given week, I get so exhausted and distressed. I feel like closing my eyes as tight as possible and it becomes painful. My head and eyes hurt significantly. I don't know how else to explain it. Light is just physically and emotionally distressing.

I finally got officially diagnosed Autistic by a Psychologist. I forwarded the letter she provided to my HR and requested that I go back to working from home. Their response was that my position is in office and that we can try to find in office accommodations. As you can imagine, there aren't many ways to lower the light levels in a shared office space without impacting my coworkers. The HR representative pretty much gave up trying to help and keeps telling me to tell her if I think of any options. I've pointed out to her multiple times that I've worked from home for a year and a half already without issue. I pointed out that my current in office computer is already set up to be able to work from home. I even provided my performance reviews from 2020 to present showing that working from home didn't negatively affect my performance and even showed that I exceeded expectations in 2021 when I had been working from home for a year at that point. She has continued to talk around giving me reasonable reasons working from home is not an option. I've directly asked her what the reasons are for me not being able to work from home on March 6th, she hadn't responded as of today (03/17/23), so I sent a follow up email further asking the reasons, and her response was ""For an accommodation for an in office position would be to look for suggestions to change the work environment that would enable you to continue to work in the office. If you can think of other suggestions please reach out to me.""

She's not giving me a valid reason for me not being able to work from home. I don't see any valid reason. I worked from home for a year and a half. I don't need any special equipment to work from home. I proved that I can work from home with no issue. Honestly, I'm currently working from home for the week because my family came in contact with someone who is COVID positive and I asked my immediate boss if I can work from home for the remainder of the week. I will most likely have to return on Monday. This whole week has been the least stressful week of work that I have experienced since returning from work from home in January 2022. I've been the most productive both work wise and home wise that I have been since returning from work from home. I've been eating properly all week. Usually I only eat one meal. I've been eating three full meals. I've been cleaning, which I've struggled to do for the last year and a half because of how stressed and exhausted I am after work everyday. Thursdays and Fridays at work is typically spent crying at my desk not getting any work done because of how distressed and exhausted I am. I don't know why HR keeps refusing to give me a reason I can't work from home. I don't feel this is legal. I'm tempted to contact an attorney and sue. I don't know what to do.

752,Huge dilema with a subletter after 2 weeks,11tjgzk,"So i moved a guy in as a sublet roommate on March 5. Everything seemed on the up and up. The Background check. The fact he had a job that he was starting the same day as move in (I called the job and he was hired) He payed the rent in full. I did not care about a deposit or 1st month rent.  I let him come in a few days earlier as he was supposed to originally come on the 10th.

during this time, I told him I would finish up the written agreement and  we could discuss some things that could be changed, added or deleted.

Not 5 minutes after he moved in he wondered if he could move a couple of things around the house. I said yes. Not realizing that he was going to rearrange the entire apartment and begin to throw away personal belongings and things that were already in the aparment prior to his arrival. Including but not limited to My cloth shower curtain which I pulled from the trash 3 times all but one set of my 10 set chopstick set saying ""No one needs that many"" .  My expensive bar body soap I got for xmas. Unplugged all of my google items and put them in a cabinet because ""bluetooth hurts his ears""  He removed the painting on the wall over the tv and said ""It hurts my eyes while I am watching tv""  He also broke the leg on my dining table and the threw the little tip on the end of the faucet in the garbage. I bought a new shower curtainwith black & white pinstripes on the lower half that i can't even put up because he said ""It bother's my eyes yet he want and bought a clear one with rainbow sparkles. and said that is what we are using.

and after stating that the closet in the hall is private as there is no closet in my bedroom and that it was my personal closet and he had no reason to go in there as he already had multiple times, he laughed and said ""Its a linen closet.""

He was informed that the living room, kitchen and bathroom and pantry were shared spaces. Yet, he would lock the living room door as his bedroom is at the other end of the living room, keeping me as the rent holder out of my own living room every night so far to the point of where today, I had to remove the dead bolt.

He  demanded verbal communication only and I told him that verbal was fine for casual conversations and that anything in regards to the apartment should be via text so that it is in writing.  Things escalated. so 3 nights ago he got mad at me because I wasn't communicating properly to his standards ""Verbally vs text""  and said that he would move out on the 5th which was his move in date. I thought nothing of it. Then he did again last night and by early this morning I had him replaced. He went absolutely psycho when i told him. Attempted guilt trips, threats, even said he would off himself. He was sort of volitile from the start and would say things such as ""do you really need this?"" or ""Why do you have this?"" and moving my person stuff around.. putting some of it in places that i still can't find it or just plain out throwing it in the garbage. As well as things that were here in the place when I moved in that belongs to my friend from who I am leasing the apartment.

He blew up my phone with nasty texts for my entire shift at my job today. And then claimed that when he said he was leaving he had a PTSD moment and I have no right to replace him. (how was i supposed to know? But sounds like a load of crap to me.""

Once he sent the text saying he would leave by the 5th he began to accuse me of kicking him out. Nope. never did that. He made the decision. Now it's just this guy is pyscho. Ultimately, what I need to Know, is can I tell him to GTFO without refunding him any money for the remainder of his stay as I can't afford to do that but I need him gone NOW! I am actually currently locked in my bedroom with the cat in the fear he is going to try to murder me in my sleep. He is that nuts. What do I do?

755,Gf’s ex boss threatening to sue,11ta0gr,"*UPDATE*

Hey there folks quick question, Im going to make this short and sweet and I will post the facts first. Before anything thanks for the help if any, Im just trying to find out what we should do next or if this is just an empty threat.

This is in Nebraska btw

• Over half a year ago my gf was fired for “budget cuts” after being a manager for a hotel (H1). 

• My gf finds a new job as AGM at new hotel (H2) and is doing well

• Time skip to a couple weeks ago, Gf is talking to old coworker (OC) from H1 finds out she is possibly looking for a new job

•Gf tells her she can apply on indeed if she wants to and could send her an offer letter since she was a good worker

• OC puts in two week notice and applies, all goes smoothly with onboarding after two weeks

• No biggie no problem for a while till now, old boss finds out my gf talked to OC about a job and exclaims he is going to sue my gf for stealing staff, to his current staff. 

• Being still friends with H1 staff, OC heard through the grape vine that old boss is thinking of suing my gf, staff at H2 hear this too, up until it reaches my gf and her GM

•My gf is getting nervous and her GM asks if she signed an affidavit, gf does not think so and so we are to our current problem.

UPDATE
•• My gf and I looked through her paperwork from the past year and we found that she did sign a non-solicitation form from H1 in November 2022 that would’ve ended in nov 2023

•• my gf is now scared her current job might be in jeopardy because of this would this also be a problem?


Now that we know it is a big possibility what can we do, what channels can we take and how can we prepare the best we can in case we do get sued. If you guys need clarification or any more info let me know any help is appreciated, thank you guys so much.",ToucanCris,4,7,0.82
756,Child custody: contempt of court,11tivt4,"My wife and I have court ordered separation and child custody agreements signed by a judge.

Seeking advice as to whether or not I have enough valid reasons to take her to court. I just want what’s best for my daughter, but I’m also at a breaking point and tired of letting her walk all over me. I cannot afford a lawyer. I spent $8k on attorney fees defending myself from a false DVO, which she used in an attempt to take my daughter away, and then for separation and custody agreements. So I’ll have to do it on my own. I understand this is not ideal but I can’t go into debt either.

Is the following enough cause to seek relief from a judge? Will they even care? I feel my wife is committing all sorts of contempt and being abusive. Is it worth taking to a judge?

Married 5 years. Share 3 year old daughter. Wife has 16 and 11 year old boys from previous marriage.

The court ordered custody agreement for our 3 year old is 50/50 on a 2/2/3 schedule, which follows my work schedule. She works from home and her hours are flexible. The receiving parent picks up our daughter from the other’s house at 5:20 with a 15 minute grace period (5:20-5:35). Time and location may be changed if mutually agreed upon. Lengthy rules regarding co-parenting, no introducing new partners, no bad mouthing other parent, etc. 

I got the house and my wife was given 90 days to vacate the home. She finally moved out 2 weeks ago 30+ days past her 90 day deadline.

She moved into a 3 br home. Order states she must live in the same county and she literally moved to the complete opposite side of the county 40 minutes away, knowing we exchange daughter every 2 days. She gave her 16 and 11 yr old boys their own rooms and my daughter has no room. She just put her stuff in her bedroom and lets her sleep in her bed. I only know because literally every time I pick her up my daughter repeatedly asks why she doesn’t have a room at mommy’s new house and why mommy doesn’t live at her house anymore

We each have a list of items that were declared our property by the separation agreement. Everything else was to be split equitably. When she left she emptied the house and took 90% of what wasn’t listed.

She also took items that were declared mine by the court order. (Kayaks, other items, over $1k worth)

She got her own phone plan and new phones and left me with a $1k phone bill to pay off her and her son’s phone, but kept the phones.

She cheated me out of taxes. She filed separate and claimed all 3 kids. She got over $8k on her return and I got $112 on mine. I paid 80% of the bills and expenses last year. 

She constantly tells me and threatens me that when our daughter is “older” she’s going to tell her “everything bad you’ve ever done to her mother.” Mind you, she has a 16 yo boy she still hasn’t even bothered to tell the truth about his own father. (Lies to him that her ex husband is his bio dad, but he isn’t) 

2/15 after being picked up from my wife’s my daughter told my parents- “Bubba said daddy’s a bad person. I don’t like daddy he’s mean to bubba” (her brother)

2/27 she told my daughter, in front of me, “baby girl, never date a man like your father.”

3/1 text both of my parents how sorry she was it was ending this way but wanted to reassure them she had no intention of keeping our daughter from them or her father and that I “could see her on my court scheduled visitation if I chose to do so.” (We have 50/50 joint custody)

3/6 wife picked up daughter at my house and requested to go inside to retrieve last of her items. I had to go to work but allowed her to go in and asked her to just lock the door behind her. She left the kitchen window unlocked and partially removed the screen. She was mad I changed the locks. I know she unlocked the window because that exact day I had changed the locks and checked every window to ensure they were locked.

3/8 picked daughter up from wife’s house. Told her to give me $2k for daughters tax credit or I would take her to court. She yelled that it was all hers and I “wasn’t getting shit.” Then her 16 yr old stormed to the front door and started screaming at me to “get the fuck off their property” “you got 10 seconds” and she just stood there letting him scream and curse at me.

3/9 while cooking breakfast for my daughter the power at house shut off. This was the next day after attempting for the last time to resolve tax money issue without going to court my wife was petty and called and had my power turned off

3/10 I waited until 540 (20 mins past pickup time) then had to leave to make it to work on time. Wife got mad that she had to drive to my work to get daughter.

3/13 wife requested to meet halfway instead of me getting her from her house.  I obliged to her request. While driving home daughter blurted out “*her brother* didn’t want to ride with me and mommy he didn’t want to see stinky daddy”

3/15 wife picked up daughter from my house. Brought a bunch of garbage bags full of trash from her house and had her son toss them in my trash cans. I also told her we needed to talk, she ignored me, grabbed our daughter and drove off without speaking. I needed her to reset the login info for the mortgage site so I could make the payment. It’s under her phone number. 

3/16 wife text me at 9pm saying I had to meet her at X location tomorrow to pick up daughter. (Court order states pickup at our homes unless mutually agreed upon) I asked her why and she refused to say. Just told me I had to meet her there because she would not be at home. Location she gave is equal distance from my home to hers (40 min) but it’s the opposite side and almost 1.5 hr from her house. I already made plans for tomorrow to run errands near her house and planned it that way to be there to pick up my daughter. I told my wife no and she is pissed. But I do not see why I have to reschedule my plans and time to appease her demands.",brokenconfused765,2,2,0.75

My wife (we aren't US citizens) started an application for a B1 visa for the US.

She received from the embassy a temporary refusal because apparently she needed a J1 instead.

She started the process for a J1 visa but in the meantime new events happened and she can't go anymore.

We heard that a visa refusal lead to an effective ban from US territory, since it's much harder to get a new visa after a refusal.

If we cancel the J1, do we have to disclose this refusal during a subsequent visa demand?

Currently, the embassy has the temporary refusal for B1 but the J1 is still at the sponsor agency.

I have a friend who owes my roommate money. She (the roommate) bought him (the friend) something, which cost $20. Now she's charging interest, and he owes her $40.

769,I need help,11ti28f,"So, first off, TW: mentions of ab*se and SA

Hello! I'm 17, almost 18 (F).


I have an online friend who is 15. I've known them for about 3-4 years (I met them when they were 12). From what they tell me (I have an audio file that they recorded) they are being mentally, verbally, and emotionally abused by their parents. We live in two different states, for context as to why I need help.

A few weeks ago, they were coerced into having sex with a friend with benefits we'll call ""A"". Now, their friends and dad are trying to pressure them into forgiving ""A"" for what she did. I cannot tell you how much that infuriates me, because ""A"" has done something similar to my friend before. No one will take a ""no"" as an answer. Their mother said that my friend was ""asking for it/deserved it"". My friend has full blown panick attacks at the thought of looking at ""A"" and cries uncontrollably at the mention of ""A"".

Now, for the legal question: How can I get them out of the house as soon as possible so they can come live with me? 
They have actively said that they would rather live with me than live where they are now. I know that I currently cannot help them while being under 18, but I will be  the summer. I plan on getting a two bedroom apartment to prepare for this and I'm going to be getting a second job to help out with costs. The place where I work hires 15 year olds, so I'll have them work with me and have my job give us similar schedules.

773,Accidental Refund,11tb4ih,"In USA, Alabama - Online Order - Out of state company.

&#x200B;

About 6 months ago I was refunded for the price of an entire order, instead of one of the items which was broken. The items were all part of one larger piece. (A fridge, and accessories for that fridge). I called the company 3 or 4 times trying to explain to them that they refunded me incorrectly in spite of them assuring me over and over again it was correct. 

&#x200B;

The final time I called in December asking them if they are 100% sure that they are meaning to refund this entire order even though the fridge is at my home and is working? ""Yes it says the entire order is refunded"". I tried in vain to explain I was aware it was refunded but I very much did not think it should have been. I asked if I needed to return the item, ""No"". Anyway I finally just gave up and used that money to pay down a medical bill. <- Turns out to be a stupid idea.

I know its not ok if I order something not to pay for it, but I no longer have the money for this right now, and they are sending it to collections and they won't even accept a return.

i reviewed the video and think i have a solid plan to contest, and want to know how likely it would work. im not denying i was over the speed limit, but 5 over is barely laughable in Iowa. the bill might be smaller for a 5-10mph offence vs over 10.... this is very much paraphrasing and not how ill word it in the letter!!!



i drive a 2007 SUV. my car is old enough to be fucking emancipated in human years. Ill start by mentioning my spedometer is 3-5mph off, so it reads lower than my ""true speed"". and then ill use specific metrics such as noticing discrepancy in the other speed monitor on X road in X location that reads me my speed. monitor says 30 car says 34. Then i plan to mention specific points in the video, first point being when the video clocks my car entering frame, then maybe half a second later my break lights flash. i let up quick, but continue to hit my breaks another second later through the continuation of the video to the next light that is red. the snapshot is a top speed that i did not sustain and is also at THE BOTTOM OF A DAMN HILL. it did not take a second or third reading of speed. I'll use that to argue my case for this being a first time offence, and also not a case of sustained speed, only instantaneous. ill continue arguing that i was not likely going that fast before entering the frame either, it was likely less than 2 seconds i was going over, which was a misreading anyways, and i very quickly corrected it. 



i also want to know if me contesting it will just get me in deeper shit... and how stupid this defense actually is. i figured i might as well give it a shot. idgaf about money i just dont want it on my record as a 10mph+ moving violation

When I was first hired (like second day working) my GM informed our restaurant that we would be getting a raise to $16.50 sometime soon. I’m being told my pay will be increased this current pay period (03/13-03/26) so naturally I start texting my friends excited thinking we were all getting a raise only to find out that all 4 of them had been getting 16.50 since they started working (the earliest being 12/05/22 and the latest I can recall being 03/08/23), so for the past 4 months/8 pay periods I have proof that other workers under the same job title AND other positions which are substantially equal work have been getting paid more than me. A few factors I can eliminate, seniority (worked longer than all of them), merit (one of these employees was almost fired for not showing up or contacting our GM for 3 consecutive shifts), and quantity/quality (we all do the exact same tasks and are expected to do them at the same level). However I am a white male and my coworkers are 3 white males and 1 white female so I don’t know if I’m protected under the equal pay act as it’s not gender, race, religiously or ethnically based. I also should mention these people were hired at the 16.50 rate and I started at the 15.25 but i don’t believe a raise should take 4.5 months to process. Would I be protected solely due to the fact that they have no bonafide system that validates their rate being higher than mine? Would I file a complaint to the DOL instead of the EEOC? I plan on speaking to my GM In a non-threatening way on Saturday during my shift to see first if there is a valid reason (most slip ups at our store are a result of his incompetence) and if I could be compensated for the hours I worked while other employees were being payed a higher rate. If he denies me compensation I plan on lawyering up but I would really like to know if my issue is valid before as I can’t seem to find anything online about my specific issue.

TLDR: 4.5 months of being paid less for exact same job, no merit or seniority system, equal quality/quantity of work but no race or gender discrimination, is this legal?

What actions should I take in the meantime? I already have proof of the pay rate disparity and the dates they started being paid more than me. 

Advice would be much appreciated!!",DistributionCrafty65,2,0,0.44

783,Living Trusts,11tg7yy,"My mother and stepfather have been married for 20+ years. My stepfather is a widower and had a couple of kids with his late wife. He and his kids are currently estranged due to them stealing money from him throughout the years. I never had a relationship with them either since they were already grown and out of the house by the time my mom and him got married. 

When they created a joint trust he did not want his kids in the trust. Earlier this year he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and had to spend a couple of days at a hospital that specializes in patients who have dementia. Due to my stepfather’s health degrading I felt it was the right thing to do by contacting his kids about his situation. My mother and I would call the hospital daily to see how he is doing and one day we found out he was discharged and picked up already. I called my stepbrother and he forwarded my call. I sent text messages to no reply. They own land out in the country side and we are unable to get a civil standby by the police due to land being private. We wanted to see him to see if that’s where he really wants to be or if he wants to go home.

Early today, I scratched my head and found little bugs all over my hand. I put them under a microscope, and at first glance it looked like lice. After some more looking, and second/third opinions, it turns out they were mites. The veterinarian (my boss) even confirmed it. Fun fact, mites spread through physical contact. And we work in tight spaces together. They came from a chicken I was handling early in the day while on the job. 

Here’s where my question comes into play. I told my boss I needed to go home and get clean so the risk of infection and/or transmission would be lower. She stated that she couldn’t let me go before the other employees (I close the offices usually). I told her that it was a risk to make me stay, but she said that she still couldn’t let me go. After a while my managers said they would deal with it and sent me home. I’m just trying to understand if she can legally make me stay after knowing this was a health risk?

My mom is finally leaving my FIL, starting last night she is staying with me. I am uncertain on legal advice to give. 

The final straw occurred when a fire broke out in the bathroom due to a lit cigarette being left out. There was extensive fire and smoke damage. She was not home at the time and he managed to put the fire out. She has pictures of the damage.

He is a manipulative person and knows how to make my mom feel guilty (she is a very empathetic person). I am worried because he is sneaky.

Today, she went back home unexpectedly to get some personal belongings and took a picture of some things he was writing down. First, was ""Tamarindo, Int license not required, proof of good conduct."" He is retired, receiving a pension and social security. There is a pensioner program to gain a visa for Costa Rica. Next, there was ""Swan hp liver detox"" and swan vitc. Next, is a private address (do not feel comfortable listing here) and directions to the residence. Lawyer friend? 

I know she needs a lawyer, but cost is a concern. We do not have a lot. 

Our concern is that they have a house with a credit line against it. They borrowed 10k of 56k. Can he take out the other 46k without her, even though both their names are on it? If he moves to Costa Rica, can he take ownership of the house when it is available to sell.

They also co-own a car with no loan.

Also, leaving the house does not give up ownership correct? Especially with unsafe living conditions.

800,[MO] Tow Truck and Damage Advice,11t6yu3,"So, as this post might seem annoying to get in this sub, it's more of a legal advice of what I more than likely can do. Yesterday, my vehicle was towed from the parking lot by accident by the PM. I was able to get the notification as soon as it happened, and they advised it was only meant to be sticker and not towed, and they just towed it without the 24 hour notice. The parking lot rules just changed, so the spot I was parking in went from a Good Spot to a No Parking Spot that same day, and the vehicle was brought back by the truck within 30 minutes, so I am thankful for that and no fees or anything paid.

Upon receiving the vehicle back, I did an inspection to make sure there were no damages, as I already knew they take photos of the exterior for their cause and videos of anything. Upon reviewing my dashcam and the outside area, it showed they dragged the vehicle, while it was in gear, about 20 feet from the parking spot to the middle of the lot since they said, **""We couldn't get the dolly on it with it being right there.""** I noticed my rear tire had a few nails inside of it and sidewall damage that wasn't there before, along with my transmission now making a whining noise in 1st and 2nd gear; the vehicle was in 1st gear while it was being pulled about 15 to 20 feet from the spot. The transmission is new; I have my old one sitting in my living room being disassembled by me, so this one is new and was put in one month ago. I had called the office and advised that **""Hey, there's damage to the vehicle that I want to talk about.""** And right off the bat, **""Of course you'd be calling about damage; all you vehicle owners with that model call about damage after a tow; what's all wrong with it, hmm?""** I had advised that they, my rear tire has a bolt and a nail in it, I'm not going to pay that damage to get it fixed, and I want to get your insurance,"" and after that it was more of a mocking **""Oh, are you serious? Your rear tire has a bolt in it. Really? You want my insurance for that? We didn't take off your tires or rotate your tires or drive the car; how can we have put a bolt in it? Insurance isn't going to fix that.''**

The big thing is also proving that it was caused by them and that's what they're going of too is **""Yeah, prove we did it.""** attitude. The really only big thing I have is dash cam footage of them dragging the car, then putting it on dollies, and me working on the car the day before I took the rear tires off to work on the suspension, which has no bolts like the one in my tire. I keep track of everything—every ID number in the car, mileage, and such—along with any work documented and 24 hour recording on the vehicle as that car is my livelihood; it's my project car I've had for years and know it in and out and what's wrong with it and not. The spot I was in was a clear spot. This went on for 10 minutes, along with more refusal and some big-assed douchery that didn't get anywhere. I went to test drive the car and have footage previously of inside the car with no noise or problems from the transmission. When I test drove it, I knew I had a whine on Accel and Decel in 1/2 that wasn't present, and I have talked with the JDM company I bought the transmission from, and they also re-advised that it's a perfectly fine transmission that we tested and had no problems with, no noise or sounds, shavings, or broken parts when we re-checked. I think the annoying thing is how it was handled and the absolutely ridiculous explanation the call taker gave after I brought it up. This company does have a history, from 2012 to recently, of theft and forgery and more stuff that's happened with it, along with some news spotlights on bad businesses and the reviews are already about 2/5 3/5 stars.

What are my options? Is this just a big, leave it alone, it isn't even worth it because it's a towing company and my options are just slim to stupid none? BBB isn't going to do anything, Google Reviews aren't going to do anything, another phone call won't do anything, and they'll get nowhere except with a property damage report from the police; they're going to continue acting high and mighty until something's done. Who knows, maybe they're on this thread on reddit. If you all want the vehicle model, I'll advise of it if its needed, its an import from overseas.",kband1,0,4,1.0
801,There is a drug dealer on my street threatening children,11thgab,"(Throwaway acc)
I dont know who to ask. I don't know what to do. 

Tl;Dr (the title, and no, i cant call the police)

I dont know when it started, but sometime a year ago around December of 2021/January 2022, everybody on my street started to realize something going on. I'm not gonna go too much into detail because I'm honestly afraid for my life if they recognize me. 

I live in a nice neighborhood, we live right around the corner from a gated community in fact. But basically, since then, there have been these big pickup trucks with modified mufflers and those douchey utility lights on the top, driving down my street at anywhere from 70-100 mph. There are children on this street. Everybody hates the people who live at this house. One time I watched their driveway for a little while, and these trucks kept coming and going, and getting handed packages when they came up, before immediately leaving again. They revv up their engines at 4 in the morning just to cause trouble. Neighbors have knocked on their door to try and calmly talk to them about their children trying to sleep, and they have gotten confrontational from out of nowhere. 

My street has about 30 houses on it total, with more than half having children either elementary school or younger. There are also at least 3 houses I know of with autistic children. There are multiple blind curves and hills, and even just driving normally (not speeding at 100 mph at 4AM with your lights off) you might struggle to drive the road if you've never done it before. It's only a Matter of time before somebody is killed by them. 

On multiple occasions, they have simply become confrontational with people minding their own business, either walking down the street with dogs/children/strollers and even simple joggers. 

I'm almost sure their child doesn't even have a driver's liscence and he's driving anyway. 

Anyway, the main reason I'm writing this is because I genuinely don't know what to do. Just the other day, I found out, a woman called the police on them because she lived right across from them, and they were doing nothing but burning rubber in their driveway and in the street for hours. The next day, at least 5 trucks came by while she was gardening, with her children in the front yard, and all revved their engines, and started yelling at her, calling her a cunt, dyke, bitch etc. And threatening to kill her and her children if she ever did anything again. They did this in front of her children. 

How did they know it was her? The only explanation is the police are on their side. She called anonymously, but they somehow knew it was her? That's the only reason possible it's gone on this long. Everybody on the street I've talked to agrees. I can't call the police, and nobody can really do anything about it.

It's only a matter of time before they kill somebody. Who do I call? What can I do? The state police? Do I somehow call the swat team or something?",Super-Leading-9601,1,0,0.5

What happened was I was supposed to move in with someone, one thing lead to another I couldn’t move in. I unfortunately already signed the lease to move in. I told him if he was going to renew the lease take me off. When he renewed the lease he left me on there and I didn’t know until months later when someone told me. I wasn’t really friends with him at this point and I just didn’t think much of it at the time. He renewed the lease the beginning of 2020. Rent was roughly 1500 a month meaning he didn’t pay about the last 4-5 months of rent. I didn’t know any of this since we weren’t talking. 

I get a letter in the mail from a debt collector a few weeks ago saying they are trying to collect the debt and they have been trying to reach us. I didn’t know until this point. This was a friend of my brother’s and i thought I could trust him since my brother was good friends with him. 

Now I have no clue how to move forward with this. I talked to them and they sent me the stuff they had to look over. I haven’t called them back to talk about it any further. Part of me wants to get a lawyer but I don’t know how I can work this out.

806,Held at gun Point and now my Credit Score is About to Sink,11t2d5c,"Long story short, last year I moved in with a roommate to help finances due to being in grad school. Everything went downhill terribly fast. 

He started suffering with his mental health. I had to get the police involved on 4 different occasions. He owned a gun and would make threats of suicide and harming others. I called the cops and they wouldn’t take the weapon from him since he legally owned it and couldn’t do anything legally unless he told them personally that he was suicidal. 

After multiple attempts of speaking with the front office of the apartment complex at the time about breaking my lease due to fear of my own safety, they refused to do anything and basically told pay $20K to cover the reminder of the lease or just be stuck.

One day he had a mental break down and held me and another friend at gun point in the living room. Cops were called he was taken to jail, protection orders were filled, cops spoke to the apartment and we were given a “Permission to Leave” or whatever it was called instead of an eviction. I was only given 3 days to be out before they start the legal eviction process. Luckily a found a place the very next day.

Before leaving I asked them was there any fees or any kind I had to pay before leaving and they told me no they just wanted us out. Fast forward today almost a full year later, I get a call from a debt collector saying I owe $3K for damages and new tenant replacement fees and etc. I was told this was placed in collections back in Sept of 2022 but they are just now reaching out to me about it. I basically told them I have a restraining order against him and have no way of contacting him and I’m in grad school and told them the most I could pay is $30 - $50 a mont.They told me that wouldn’t work and I have 30 days to pay before it hits my credit score.

807,Should we pursue a case against police for reckless chases?,11trwn4,"Challenging  a police department is hard, and also sometimes risky in my Mom's rural  South Carolina town. There are also a lot of hard heads that live in  the town, and they like to run from the police, and the police love  chasing them. A popular thoroughfare is my Mom's street that is close  access to the highway.

About two  months ago, my mom was woke up by a crash in front of her mobile home in  which a mix of Aiken County, SC and Richmond County, GA police chased,  and rammed a car in front of her house causing it to flip toward her  lefthand neighbor's home. Mom's home security system caught the video,  and the car was only stopped by a stump in front of the neighbor's  house. Without, the car would have flipped right into her home. We are  also pretty sure the chased was killed because the ambulance left with  no lights on after the driver was not moving on the ground outside the  car. Other residents note the chases are out of hand too.

Early  this Tuesday morning 3-14-23 there was another chase, and one neighbor  says she heard them ram this car as well. The car went out of control  and barreled through my hearing impaired Mom's bedroom after midnight.  It was odd for her not to be in bed at the time, and thank goodness she  was not. The box model car entered the room all the way up to the  windshield. After the car sat there for about 30 minutes, it caught on  fire under the house and burned her bed, a chest drawer of new clothes,  family pictures, and important documents.

The  fire went into the ceiling and also came out in the other rooms'  ceiling vents. I feel like they will not be able to fix the damage, and  insurance will not cover an entirely new mobile home. So far we have had  to put her in a hotel room for who knows how long, and at what price.  The police didn't even ask if she was ok. So disrespectful that they  would even chase and ram people on a residential street! I just don't  want this to happen again, to anyone on  the street, because I am 800  miles away, Mom is hearing impaired, and the next person it happens to  may not be so lucky.

The guy who  was running shot someone in the leg, and they deemed it attempted  murder. I'm not negating the guy was dangerous, but they could have  literally ended a few lives, trying out their big boy toys.

My  question is would I have a case against the police department for  recklessness with videos of the incidents? Can my mom seek damages?  Should the convict's insurance cover any damages?

I just want her to be made whole in a situation that had nothing to do with her until they recklessly chased this nitwit. HELP!",wipemedown7,10,0,0.13

1. I went under contract for a home at the end of January. Viewed the home prior to it being listed in MLS (I was not aware of this at the time)
2. Interest rates are insane but was able to get everything lined up for an FHA remodel loan
3. Needed appraisal but the order was pulled and then returned to the system causing a delay
4. Got the paperwork and appraisal set up for this week to close; earnest money paid less than a week post offer
5. Seller's agent tried to remove the contract due to the delays on the day of closing
6. Seller's agent finally informed us that the property is facing foreclosure in less than a week
7. Seller's agent will not allow another contractor bid and tried to add triple the earnest money as a nonrefundable deposit that does not apply to the down payment or closing costs
8. Tried to go with a hard money lender in order to get the property closed to the date specified with the new information but that lender then tried to charge well over 15K for putting up the cash for a 100K house (we were going to refinance into an FHA mortgage after the fact, literally a week or so after today)
9. When said lender was informed that fees of that nature are in fact illegal, would not decrease the amount to even the maximum that he can charge a consumer
10. I literally was closing so I have homeowners insurance on the property, earnest money paid and the down payment was being wired 
11. Sellar's agent changed the property today to pending with a cash buyer and that the sellar specifically does not want to work with my loan type at all

Preface, I work in California. Back in June 2022 I was denied SPSL by my previous employer. I provided a positive test (antigen), and a nurse note (Kaiser stated they don’t issue doctor’s notes for positive covid tests). When I tried using my own sick time to cover the days I was out sick I was denied. Their claim was that I didn’t call the employer’s attendance phone number everyday I was sick and that I didn’t provide a doctor after the 5th day. 

I submitted a wage claim with DLSE more than half a year ago, and recently had my conference hearing with the DLSE and my previous employer. My employer agreed their wrongdoing and are willing to pay the amount withheld, and Labor Code Section 248.5 (b)(2) [An additional sum for SPSL for sick days calculated at three times the amount of sick days unlawfully withheld, not to exceed $4,000.]

Can you explain again how the overtime on Saturday works? Like how that one time ya asked n it wasn’t overtime. How do you know it did apply as overtime or idk am confused on even explaining it.  

C:


Thanks. 


For OT it’s if you’ve worked the 40 hours for that week in that pay period. So like this week, the pay period started today the 16th. You wouldn’t get OT for working on the 18th because there’s only been 16ish hours you could’ve worked on the 16-17th.


The 25th I can get OT since it’s all the same pay period. M-f would get me the 40 hours that week so anything on Saturday would be OT.


M: 


So if you work every Saturday either way would be overtime in the end? Or no? Or would it then apply to like a friday or something


C: 


Not every Saturday. If the pay period started on a Wednesday you wouldn’t have enough hours by Saturday to get the OT. Has to be both 40 that week and 40 that pay period to qualify. So if someone works 10 hours in 4 days then the 5th day would be all OT. That’s why I’m only looking at Saturdays that are at least a week after the pay period. Starts.

822,Falsely accused of battery,11t6qkg,"So sorry if this is all over the place first time using Reddit and I’m pretty overwhelmed. It’s long but I’m desperate for help 

I’ve been falsely accused of battery. I feel like I need to give background for the accusations to make more sense. 
I’ve been married almost 2 years now dated my husband for 1 yr. One of his friends came to him beginning of 2022 and confessed one of the times my husband had left his wallet while hanging out he had made copies of his id and social security card to use. He used it for 2020 and 2021. The reason he even came to my husband was to ask him for money. 
When my husband and I went back over w2s with our tax person she told us for 2020 she included a w2 and my husband said it wasn’t his( she can look up his w2 on an app instead of getting copies mailed to us) which makes sense cause we never got one. When we were paying into the irs we thought it was for my husbands current job but it turns out it was because “his friend” w2. 
I really have no knowledge of how to even go about reporting that or what to do. It took all our out savings to pay the irs so we can’t exactly afford a lawyer so if anyone could give me knowledge on that part it would be much appreciated. 

Getting back to this my husband had told the guy he needed to pay us back the money he already cost us and the guy said he would. We had it in writing but then he stopped sending anything. We had ran into him at a local festival and it wasn’t tense or anything the guy told my husband his phone wouldn’t let him send my husband anymore money and to stop by to pick a payment up. So we did and the guy became very hostile with us and told us he didn’t agree to anything and tried grabbing my bag with the actual tax papers in it. I didn’t want stuff to get physical so we ended up leaving and my husband told him he was going to just report him. The next thing I know I’m getting papers in the mail saying I physically assaulted his girlfriend and their baby. Which is CRAZY. I’m a mother myself and would never touch another child let alone another person holding a baby. I can’t afford a real lawyer so I have a public defender but she hasn’t been help at all. She told me my husbands statement can’t be used because the prosecutor doesn’t believe it and she didn’t even turn my statement in it then how will the judge know my side??? The only “ proof this girl provided was she had a red mark on her arm but I never touched her.  What do I do?? Should I be worrie???? I’m scared that because I’m not taking the plea deal I’ll get in trouble anyway for something I didn’t do. I live in Indiana too 

And also to add my husband has even less knowledge about taxes because he always worked for his dad growing up and never even got a real job until we started dating. When I try telling him about reporting him he is scared he will get in trouble too and I don’t even know if that’s possible",Kindem67,1,3,0.8
823,HOA setback guideline,11tfdh8,"I live on a corner lot. I asked the HOA to place a garage in the rear of my property on the side closest the street. The HOA referenced section 1 and claims I have a 35 ft setback. I don't believe this is true and the setbacks in this section are specific to the main residence as their is a specific accessory structure setback section. 

1. Set Backs.  Residences must be set back to a minimum of 35 feet from the front lot line, a minimum of 20 feet from the rear lot line and no structures shall be located less than 10 feet or 10% of the width of the lot, whichever is less, from the interior side lot lines.  Set backs for corner lots shall be a minimum of 35 feet from the side lot line which faces the street. 
2. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES  This section refers to all detached accessory buildings and structures, including but not limited to sheds, garages, workshops, pavilions, pole barns, pool houses, pet enclosures/houses, pool houses and workshops.  Accessory structures must be set a minimum of 10 feet from side property line and 5 feet from rear property line (SRC LDC 2.10.05). Roof of accessory structure shall not exceed height of existing home. Accessory structures fewer than 600 sq. ft. with no plumbing or electricity require a Santa Rosa County Accessory Building Permit Exemption. All Accessory Structures must be tied down if located more than 10’ from main structure, with tie down specifications provided to the Association. The roof material must be non-reflective. Accessory structures shall not be used for human inhabitation.  

The way I read the combination of these 2 sections of the combind rules and policy are. 

My residence setback is 35 from the front, 35 from the street side, 10 from the interior side lot and 20 from the rear. Which matches my legal survey plot. 
The accessory structure or garage would be 5 from the rear and 10 from the side and or the minimum county requirements. Which in my case I have a 6 ft easement on the rear and 15 on the side due to it being a corner. I habe already verified this with the county. 

The HOA attorneys response to our general manager who supposedly asked was: ""Regardless of use of the terms ‘residences’ or ‘structures’, the clear intent and consistent interpretation of the provision is that for corner lots, there are 35 foot setbacks for each portion of the yard bordering the street.  This is consistent with most communities for aesthetics as well as sight line safety for vehicles approaching or stopped at the corner.   Thus, the placement of a garage structure inside the 35’ setback would, in my opinion, be prohibited by the setback restrictions."" 

I disagree with this response as setbacks are defined differently in the accessory structure section which gives merit to the definition of structure. The terms residence and structure should not be used as one in the same and the section is not meant for interpretation and there is no clear intent written or it would have specified in the accessory struture that corner lots have a 35 ft structure setback. If residence and structure are able to be used as one in the same then all structures have a minimum setback of 20 ft from the rear as well and the accessory section becomes a mute point.  

Not to mention there are over two dozen corner lot homes with either a garage or shed within the ""35 ft"" setback. 

I feel that my reading and understanding of the setbacks which closely align to the county setting and style of setbacks is accurate. What leg do I have to stand on or approach could I take to move this forward? I do not wish to put a garage in the back corner of my lot. Not to meantion my property line is already 40ft back from a road already.

825,Fighting my dad over a 529 acct.,11tf85t,"Hello, first time posting anything, but I'm (22) planning to pursue fighting my dad over a 529 acct funded by my brother's godfather. Based in Washington state.

Background: My brother's godfather back in 2018 or so gave each of us kids 150k into a 529 acct. with the capital group because of what my mother did for him and his company (nothing sus, she just helped him with a very lucrative deal and he wanted to return the favor). My mother was supposed to also have access and knowledge of the details but was left out on purpose. She accepted it then and to this day still has no access, my dad alone has access to all the accounts.

Current: My father hasn't been the best and in Feb 2022 they began their divorce within the past month, they have gotten to a point at which all the evil deeds my father has done with money are beginning to show themselves. One thing though is that he has yet shown anything about the 529 accts and is reluctant to show anything about them. My mom has also requested that I and my sister (20) be given full access to the accounts because we are older and can make our own decisions, he of course refused.

Now nothing can be confirmed but it is highly speculated that my account had 70k taken and possibly used to purchase the car that he bought 2 years ago. They know this due to the other accounts not showing any car payments and a few other things, essentially the car and the money for it came out of nowhere, and considering this is one of the few accounts he is refusing to show two, and two is put together.

I have used the acct for its intended purpose, school. But I had only used approx 6k so far.

Now today after learning about the 70k loss I confronted him. I said I wanted screenshots of the current balance, access to the account, and for him to voluntarily remove himself from the account. He refused. Now it is also speculated that my sibling's accounts have also been touched and it is possible that the 70k is spread across us all.

My ask is can I/ should I pursue legal action? And if not what should I do instead? Keep in mind I have already considered this relationship a loss so don't worry about that. I also was thinking of an audit that could be done on him but idk.",Top_Art_456,3,0,0.5
826,Restaurant Food Safety Concerns/Retaliation for calling the Health Department.,11tf799,"edit: moved the TLDR: I had complaints about food safety that I expressed to management, after being pulled aside and talked to and told that all of the things I was seeing as bad were fine, I called the health department. On the very same day that they show up, I'm pulled aside again and removed for ""not fitting in"". Is there a case worth pursuing here?  


So, about a month ago, I began expressing concerns for food safety to one of the managers of the new restaurant that I started working at in January. The things that are against regulation are usually brushed under a rug at most places because they're generally pretty minor, but the one that started the entire scenario was there is a bucket of a mixture of an unmeasured amount of bleach, dishsoap and water on the line on the night shifts. Once I was seeing that, I started looking for other ones, not really to do any harm to the business, rather to save it from being harmed later on (?) if someone were to get sick. I found a few and began expressing them to the the first person I met from the company that is one of the people that will be taking over and while the first text conversation about the bleach solution (actually the only instance I have a picture of because I never intended to harm the business - had I known I was going to be removed, I would've taken pictures of all of them) had responses attached, the second time I expressed the concern and unfortunately made a stupid accusation, vague but stupid, there was no response up until the next day when I was confronted the first time.

I was pulled aside in a super friendly manner and sat down to talk about my intentions in bringing up these health concerns by the current owner and two of the three woman buying it, (the one that had the texts was on vacation). Every time I expressed that I was trying to help, it was often followed with a question about my intentions. Trying to or wanting to help apparently isn't an intent to him, valid, we disagree a lot so we move on. We discuss whether or not I was happy in my position and while I said that I was fine with it, I was just concerned with the safety of the customers, that apparently made me not ""look happy"" in my position. I said that I have severe depression so, I don't look happy most of the time even when I'm having a good time. I was happy with the position, but I was concerned with the safety of the people they were serving, which doesn't make me unhappy about the environment or the challenges of their kitchen. I enjoyed both. I enjoyed the staff. I enjoyed the menu. However I was confident that what I was seeing was in violation of the regulations in place to prevent foodborne illness and because he was confident that I was wrong..  I called the local health department the next day and made a complaint.

Fast forward a couple of days to today, the health department shows up, seemingly doesn't do an inspection (it's public record, so it's possible that it wasn't updated just yet), and within an hour, maybe two? I'm pulled to the side again, sat down with 2 of the soon to be owners (the one i expressed concerns to and the kitchen manager, who had been present at the previous meeting) and him, they say nothing, he goes on calmly about how I didn't trust their policies or procedures and I respond by telling him that I was certain that we both were confident enough in our arguments that the only way to settle the matter was to bring in the health department. After a little back and forth he then tells me that I am being removed from the team because I do not fit in. I ask if he is aware of there being laws to protect employees against retaliation and he says that it isn't retaliation, just that I'm not what he wants in his team.

Is this even worth pursuing for some kind of compensation? I haven't been there 90 days, so I'm basically a new employee. In the long run I just want to make sure the customers are going to be safe, it's not like I want to work there anymore if they're going to push aside food regulations, but I'm still concerned for the customers. Be cool to get to have the last laugh and get something out of it, but that's why I'm asking if it's even worth pursuing as a case. I don't want to smear them or anything like that. In all reality, the 3 people that are taking over ownership didn't say anything at all during these meetings even though they were there, so I don't even know what their opinions on the situation are at all. But outside of the recent meetings with me, they'd always been pretty nice to me. The owner and I have had differences in opinion and communication issues since the first week I was there - there's basic kitchen etiquette like telling someone you are behind them that very few people there seem to know (especially him!!)}, which is generally how accidents happen.. so there have been disagreements since early on.

827,I received a bill 6 months later with no agreement... do I pay?,11tf4y3," 

I emailed a lawyer a question. She responded and said going forward there would need to be a retainer agreement if there was more assistance. Ok np.

7 months later… I emailed again with a related question. She responded. She said good luck and that was the last I heard from her. No ask for money, retainer, just good luck. I emailed twice, no answer. Ok.

3 months later someone from the same firm emailed asking for my credit card. Few minutes later they said that was an error.

Another 3 months later he (again the someone else) sends me an invoice. I go to their website, it no longer exists.

So I’m weirded out.

There was no agreement. No papers. Nothing signed. She ended with good luck and never answered again.

Then this completely different person 6 months later sends me an invoice.

Is this possibly legit or just a total scam? Do I pay? 6 months later? I’m so confused.",jokersup,0,1,0.67

TL/DR: Does a common pay master pierce the corporate veil?

S-Corp A: owned by individual Z
S-Corp B: owned by individual Y
LLC with S-Corp designation: owned by individuals Z&Y. Z&Y also work for this LLC

The LLC is used as common paymaster for A&B therefore pay Z&Y. Since Z&Y also work for the LLC they're legal employees of such LLC.

LLC owns 2 vehicles and leases one vehicle to S-corp A and the other to S-Corp B

2 legal questions

1) In case of a car accident are both S-Corps shielded from a lawsuit in case A or B are at fault of a car accident?

2)Both S-Corps are Professional Corporations. Would having this paymaster structure put each other at risk in case of a malpractice lawsuit?

829,What can I do about a seller trying to sue me?,11tev29,"I’ll start off by saying I haven’t signed anything not a single paper trail can be traced back for confirmation of this transaction besides me clicking the “accept offer” button on flippa. I started doing some research on this website upon getting the website transferred to me and I noticed some things that in flippas own words says it’s fishy of buying traffic (spikes in traffic).

Flippa.com is an online website market place this is where I have been talking to the seller and this is where the site was listed.

This and for numerous other reasons which I’ve given the seller are my reasoning for not wanting to do this deal:

 - the website has 1000 posts and no traffic not a single keyword ranking under 100 on any search engine.

 - more than half the backlinks show an above 80 “spam rating” in ahrefs (an online ask tool)

 - the listing says the website makes a profit of 171 per month but hasn’t made above 50 cents in the past 8 months.

 - the seller is very childlike and pushy wanting me to “quickly get the deal done” but when I ask for things he takes a day to reply the asks me to hurry up again

 - he said that there’s multiple emails of people asking for guest posts but when I asked for him to export these emails he was very reluctant to hand them over and never has in fact

 - he didn’t turn over socials ever even though I asked many times.

 - I got multiple transactions from escrow that were done outside the flippa platform created by the seller sent to my email

 - the seller originally put the listing up as an escrow transaction, but when I clicked accept offer it somehow magically changed to PayPal luckily customer service changed it back to escrow


- escrow for some reason cannot find my money I sent even though the money is out of my account and I can see the PayPal transaction and have disputed it


 - the seller seemed like he wanted to do transactions outside of the flippa platform due to flippas fees I refused this


The seller has been for days harassing me telling me he’s going to sue me. He sent me a settlement letter signed by himself and from himself.

The seller is from mosambique when I said his backlinks look like they were paid for he said his lawyer said I was defaming him and he can also sue me for that.

He sent me a screenshot from his lawyer saying that it’s an easy win and the seller will have to pay nothing. I have the image but I can’t post it here I’ll post it somewhere else and link it.

I myself have talked to a lawyer. He said that it’s kind of foolish to sue me since the website price is 900 and he’d have to send his lawyer 4 times that amount.

What are my courses of action? Can I be sued even though nothing was set in stone technically? I am not sure what to do and it is keeping me up at night any advice would be helpful. https://imgur.com/a/GGMaID3",sikaveraichai,29,0,0.4
830,Friend got into an accident with our vehicle.,11tenyf,"Hey guys, I'm from Texas and just need to figure things out. 

We became friends with this individual, who we believed to be trustworthy, and felt sorry for them because they didn't have a car. At the time, we couldn't afford to own two vehicles, so I suggested to my wife that we rent out one of them to make ends meet. Regrettably, I didn't have a written agreement to ensure our legal settlement at the time.

They were reckless with the car, speeding a lot. The first time, they got pulled over and claimed they pulled them over because our registration was expired and didn't ticket them for it. Secondly, they got pulled over for speeding but lied and said it was for the registration, then got a ticket for it. Then, lastly, they got into an accident. 

No cops were involved, but our car took the most damage compared to the other vehicles; they didn't even get a scratch. They claim that the other party brake-checked them, but further inspection made it seem like that wasn't the case. They either were on their asses or were speeding. Our insurance didn't claim the vehicle as totaled as we hoped, and we didn't have the coverage to get it fixed. I did my own math (I work on cars as well) to see how much the repairs were. Everything was close to $2000 at the warehouse. 

I didn't want to just brush this under the rug because, regrettably, they don't work to be able to pay for it. They ignored my wife's text informing them that our insurance would not pay for it, and they showed no enthusiasm when I called to inform them of the payment. I was willing to work out a solution by allowing them pay for it in six or twelve months because I was aware of their financial predicament. They said they would consider it, to which I responded that there was nothing for them to consider because this needed to be paid for. They have till the end of this week to let us know what's going on, but we're worried that they won't

I told them this is a lot better route to go through than going through small claims court because they're going to make them pay for it on the spot. So I hope to hear something soon.

Fortunately, we have photographic evidence of them from the incident as well as the identity of the person they hit. Also, we have all of their addresses and can send someone to serve them there. When they showed up for court, we assured them that we would take care of their registration-related ticket. If they don't respond by the end of the week, I'm not sure what to do. I say this because my wife needs this to be taken care of before she leaves the state soon.

With the claims that she was in an accident and that they were driving carelessly, we have sufficient proof. However, as I previously stated, neither a formal record of them promising to pay for the losses nor a recording of her liability exist. Should I take this to small claims court to get our payment or show hould I escalate it?

We are also aware that the judge might say boohoo cause we had nothing on paper to make them pay but I just wanted to ask.",Disastrous-Zombie-56,2,1,1.0

When I requested the proof/evidence of me breaking these rules, I was only told there were “witnesses”. I plan to bring this to the school board (so far I have found a way to refute all the ‘rules’ I broke- every rule they listed was NOT in the constitution, you cannot ‘make’ up rules and punish people for breaking them when they don’t exist yet.), but I think I can also argue there was insufficient evidence.

Last night my partner and I got into an argument over him not wanting to go to work and me being frustrated with always having to handle the bills and his frivolous spending. He grabbed my neck and I freaked out (was abused in the past) and threw something at the TV (opposite direction of them) to scare him off of me and he called the police. Since there was slight redness on my neck, they took a picture and arrested him. Unfortunately I had no say in what they did so now he’s sitting in jail.

I would also like to note this is not normal behavior and he was not intoxicated at all. It was just heated because this has been an issue for a while.

837,Is this false advertising?,11te3m9,"I have a question about if the customer testimonial I've been asked to create could be considered False advertising.

The context:
The customer uses our product and had a lot of good things to say about it. We wanted to create some testimonial content, which they were more than happy to do. I wasn't present for the actual meetings, but it was discovered that the customer was using a vastly outdated version of our product. The producer proceeded to update them to the latest version of the product. They also gave them access to a secondary product that benefits a lot of customers and our company is trying to hype up more. 

The problem:
They proceeded through the interviews and demonstrations advising the customer to ""act as if they'd been using the secondary product the whole time"". They now want me to orient the customer testimonial entirely around the secondary product rather than the product they were actually experienced with.

If I create a customer testimonial where they are talking about how much benefit they got from the secondary product, is that considered a misleading or fake testimonial, and thus a case of false advertising?

It's confusing because their reactions to the secondary product were positive, nothing they said about it was coerced, their reactions to using it for the first time were genuine, and their experience was definitely what virtually every other customer could expect. But I can't shake the feeling that it is illegal or at the very least ethically dubious to present it as their experience when they didn't use it until the day of the interview.

 I specifically asked him if there was a Laundry facility on the premises, he said yes and I would be able to use.
Now this was a selling point for me since I don't have a car.
This is a very large home and has 6 bedrooms, 3 downstairs and 3 upstairs which are smaller.

I went to ask a tenant for the key to wash clothes and they told me only the downstairs tenant were allowed to use the laundry room. 

I called the landlord, and now he claims he never said that and the reason the people downstairs are able to use laundry room is because they pay more rent.
The upstairs are smaller rooms and we do pay smaller.rent yes.

840,Contested guardianship over disabled adult,11tdxx8,"Hi Id like to hear your thoughts on what is likely to happen in this case. Let me be succinct.

My son is disabled and unable to live on his own or make decisions for himself. Hes probably about a 12 year old cognitive level. My husband has legal guardianship over him as we are divorced. We live 4 hours apart. My son lived with his dad his whole life. After my son turned 18, we set him up for social security disability funds which he has received monthly since he was 18. 5 years ago, my son decided he wanted to move in with me. His dad and I agreed that would be alright. Upon him moving in, I learned his dad left him in his room on his iPad all day every day. I worked hard to make my son be productive and active as I saw that was best for him. For the entirety of these 5 years, his dad continued to keep the social security money for himself, claiming he deserved it as he had our son his whole like and that was his payback.

Issues arose when I tried to get my son a part time job through Voc Rehab. He would be earning some money and that would have an affect on how much his SSI checks were. Upon hearing this, my ex showed up at my house with the cops and took my son back and ""brainwashed"" him in the meantime that I was hateful and abusive for wanting him to work and be a ""slave"".

Now we are in the process of contested guardianship of a disabled adult. My case is that I want my son to be productive, have a job, get out of bed, and live. Me and my ex will die someday and my son needs to have live skills. My ex's case is that he has had my son for his whole life therefore he deserves him. When in reality he wants that social security money.

I can easily prove that my son has lived with me for 5 years while I received none of that money on his behalf. I payed out of pocket for everything and really didnt mind until I wanted him to get a job.

Time of slip and fall: January 15th-ish

So while at work ( I work in a hospital) about two months ago, I had a slip and fall incident. I hit my head on some lab equipment. I was taken to the clinic onsite where some reflex and pupil reaction tests were administered to see if I had a concussion. They said I didn't.

Just over a month later (February 10th ish), I had seizure at work, and started wandering around confused. Some coworkers took me to the ER, and I was diagnosed with Epilepsy. There is no history of seizures or epilepsy in my family. Nor have I suffered any major head wound before. I've been trying to get a reasonable accommodation, but my work is giving me the runaround.

846,This is the strangest legal question I've ever had to ask...,11ti98o,"I relocated to Puerto Rico a couple months ago from the United States. I began using tinder and apparently my distance settings were able to connect me to women from the Dominican Republic. I met a girl. Things got very serious really fast (she expressed her desire to get married on our first date). She is about half my age, a model, and we didn't even speak the same language. Yes, very cliche mid-lofe crisis if nothing else.

About three or four weeks in she started regularly speaking about lead moving there. She was beginning college and wanted to get an apartment with me. I genuinely investigated that option, but it just didn't make sense financially. The only option at that point was topart ways - she's starting a four-year degree, probably 6 hours from where I live and I'm just relaunching my business in Puerto. It was painful to do but it seemed to be the mature approach. We were both sad, a couple tears might have been shed, it was a cordial separation of people.

About 3 or 4 days later, that all changed. I started getting these very aggressive messages on WhatsApp. She was speaking in a way that was very different. More vulgar more anger side of her that I hadn't heard. I really should have started documenting the texts then but I don't even know that that would have been admissible in court.

So then I didn't hear from her for about 2 weeks. I was at work and suddenly got this very long string of text messages on WhatsApp from this woman I believe from a different phone number. She was sending me pictures with Spanish text over them, close that look like they have been made in Instagram. She didn't texted me another picture of her in front of some web submission page for the Puerto Rican police? I'm not sure what she's reporting but she at least posed in front of it. She then said I'm going to rotten jail and that makes her happy.

From there I got a couple more very aggressive phone calls and text messages with her telling me I'm going to jail, and that I should admit what I did and contact her directly. I don't know much about law, but I realized engaging in that kind of talk is lose lose no matter what the truth is. I blocked her new number, but now I started feeling a bit scared.

Fast forward two more weeks, and around 1:30 in the morning I started getting a serious of messages from another number. This is the most angry. I've heard her, not being able to do it via text. I don't understand a lot of what she was saying, but I heard police more than one time and got the message that I'm sharing with you below. 👇

""What I love is how dumb you are. The information are group of people have and the execution we're about to execute. It's going to be monumental. It's going to make your life a living hell and was great. Is your so stubborn? You're just going to rub with it. So sit back and let our team of people destroy everything that you know. We're doing it one piece at a time and we can't wait to show you what we have coming up next""

She must have translated herself but this message was enough to make me think I need to get a lawyer or call the police or do something. I'm afraid to go directly to the police in Puerto Rico partly because of the language barrier and because who knows what this woman told them over the phone.

 I've never met her in person, but for all I know she said I raped her. I have no clue. I have no clue and there's been no specific accusations thus far. I've been wrecking my brain to try to figure out what the angle is here. Revenge obviously, but police reports and lawyers is pretty far to take a lie. She's a local model and has thousands of people that follow her online, so my second thought is is she just mixing me up with some other grand ma that does have happening? And of course, the third is that this is some sort of financial shake down, which personally I feel is probably the most likely scenario?

If I learned anything from the me too move then it's that once a woman starts saying things, what you say back does not matter. I've never gone down that road of mistreating or taking advantage of women I've never gone down that road of mistreating or taking advantage of women, and even the thought of having that put on me has been freaking me out lately

I considered directly walking into the police station with some of these text messages she'd been sending me, but I don't want to end up in a jail cell or who knows what else.

So any advice anybody has would be extremely appreciated. I'm not in a position to spend thousands on a lawyer, but depending on what she's accusing me of, it could be even worse.

And to that point, what kind of lawyer do I even call? Maybe criminal defense? But I'm not getting charged with anything and I kind of want to countersue her for slandering me on social media, which I assume is a different lawyer altogether.

TL;DR - I made the mistake of trying to date a girl to have my age on tinder. Now there might be charges against me and what do I do? What kind of lawyer do I get and what am I looking at as far as possible trouble?

Looking for some legal advice in California. I went into a contract with a solar company in August of 2022. The work was completed and panels are working, however, the interconnection with my electric company is not yet completed.

The deadline to meet NEM 2.0 is April 14th, 2023 and my application was rejected due to the solar company not seeing requests from my electric company to correct paperwork issues. We now have to resubmit application and potentially not meet the NEM 2.0 deadline.

If we don't meet the deadline, the solar deal I did is not what I was expecting and doesn't make much sense and would ultimately have to buy a home battery to make it worth while. My contract has statement that the approximate completion date is 3-6 months from signing contract (subject to permissible delays as provided in the contract) 

Contract also states:

Delays:  While unusual, local power companies and building departments sometimes create severe delays in permitting and interconnection. Contractor will keep the customer informed but cannot always expedite in time for install date. Specifically, main electrical service upgrades frequently create severe delays and require substantial extra cost.

There were no delays in installation in any way but the company screwed up on my application and didn't meet the requirements of the application. Now I am out potentially most my savings going solar.

863,"Modified Duty not given after surgery, despite doctor’s notes. Southern Ontario.",11tcr37,"Hi everyone. Very lengthy, I apologize, but it felt necessary. 

I work for a grocery retailer that is owned by Loblaws. Been there since 2011. Have worked Produce departments the last 20-something years. At this store I was the assistant produce manager. It’s a full time role with extra responsibility, basically. It’s a unionized position as is the rest of the store, minus salaried managers of course. We’re unionized with a crap union - UFCW local 175. Pure useless. 

Over the years the physical work has taken its toll on me. I’ve had 2 spine surgeries, one in Nov 2016, one in May 2022. Both times were to address various disc bulges and stenosis of the spinal cord. Painful and debilitating condition. Little bit of tissue and bone removed. Pretty routine surgery. 

After the first surgery I brought in doctors notes to get on modified duty (after my 4 weeks off on short term disability then 4 weeks of EI). Hand my boss the note and he says “ok great.”  Never heard about it again. I ask about modified and he says “you already are on modified”. I ask isn’t there something to sign? (I was unaware of the whole return to work process and have never had any family or friends in this situation, so I guess I didn’t fully know my rights). I thought it didn’t seem right but ok whatever. They had me doing less lifting and more clerical duties (ordering, invoices, signage, etc). Ok. I guess that’s what modified is. 

Eventually I’m really bad and bring in a note from my General practicioner. And my physiotherapist. This is Nov 2021. No modifies again. This time I know I’m getting played so I inquire and am told once again “you ARE on modified”. No way. Not this time! I didn’t sign anything!  I know there’s a document that I need to sign for modified. Bullshit. So I ask a union rep when he comes into the store next. He says he’ll get back to me. Never heard anything. Next time I see him I ask and he has no idea who I am or what I’m talking about. What a fucking idiot. It’s clear that the union is useless.  The franchisee has been playing games with rules and skirting around policies for some time now.  We have no union representation in the store. We should have 6 members. We have only 1. So the franchisee and his assistant know they can really try to stir some shit with little opposition. The workforce is very unaware of their rights. Lots of migrants and young people. It’s a perfect storm. 

Anyhow, over time things get bad again and I have the 2nd surgery. Im already jaded and aware of their toxic bullshit at this point. Recovery was longer and much more difficult. The surgery was early May and I really wasn’t good to return until first week of September. 
Again I have a note - from the surgeon this time. Gave the note directly to my produce manager AND the franchisee. They say ok and that’s it. No signing of anything again. WTF! Where’s my modified?!? 

I inquire and the franchisee tells me the note was vague. It didn’t outline specific restrictions and such. He tells me he has no recollection of the note from Nov 2021 either (which was very detailed). I said “so there’s a number you can call for the surgeons office. You telling me no one could be bothered to make a 10 min call to verify some details?!?  Seems negligent to me!  Also the bookkeeper would have an ethical responsibility to begin the process for modified would she not?!?unless she was instructed to not do so?
Who knows. 

I have the paper AND digital copies of all the notes from like 2019 on. 

I even applied for another department with less lifting and on my application letter I cited “…as I did not receive modified duty following spinal surgery, I can no longer perform the physical duties of my current role”. 

Just recently I had a slip and hurt back again. Some kind of spasm or sprain I suppose. I actually got modified this time, but only because I made a stink and went through WSIB.

I’d like to ask the bookkeeper to see my personnel file. I want to see everything that is - or IS NOT - in there.
Also I’d like to just assume my produce manager and franchisee just tossed the notes altogether. Like, at this point, who knows!

I’ve given so much, broke my back and ruined my fucking life for this company for a decade and they treat me like THIS?!?!

So what is my next move and does anyone have any advice in general?

TL;DR - my employer doesn’t seem to believe in modified duty and I’m arguing that their negligence has ruined my health and welfare.",Puzzleheaded_Fly2683,0,1,0.67
864,Where to start after being scammed,11tcpyg,"Where should we start after being scammed? We lost our life savings to MyConstant. 

My partner and I came from well under the poverty line and are both social workers. It has taken a decade of careful saving and working 60 hour weeks to get financially stable. Getting hit by high health insurance and taxes and having nothing at the end of the month, eating ramen.

My partner is so careful and conservative with money. We have amazing credit and have scrimped and lived on very little to save, pay off school loans, etc. We researched MyConstant, even consulted friends who work in finance, they thought it looked legit. Investment backed CDs with a high interest rate…seemed to make sense. After experimenting with small amounts for over a year, my partner put in our life savings. And to make a little money, took out zero interest for the first year loans, threw them in, with the plan of having that money sit and gain interest, then pay it all back and pocket the difference.

Now MyConstant appears to have been a Ponzi scheme…they took everyone’s money and ran. We aren’t just out our live savings, but on a clock to repay the debt too.

This was supposed to be the best year of our lives, the year we were finally financially stable with savings and stable income. I just had a baby. We had planned for me to finally be able to quit my job, which has significant physical safety risks (someone pulled a gun on me last week) to stay home with our baby and child with autism, to give them the care and support and attention they deserve. So I could focus on volunteer mentoring, and my partner could continue with work and their volunteer roles. We are both in helping professions who have dedicated our lives to our community; professionally and personally - fostering, volunteering, serving on local volunteer leadership roles. This was supposed to be the year we received back the goodness we have worked to put into the world. 

Now not only can I not quit, I need to work more. Our childcare situation is a mess, both kids have higher needs I cannot adequately support but I can’t even cut back. It will take a full year just to pay back the loans and start over from nothing. We are one emergency expense away from going under completely and losing our fixer upper home.

Where do we even start to try to get our money back? Obviously we can’t hire a fancy lawyer. Any resources or advice welcome, I know chances are it is gone forever and we are just screwed. Are there resources about victims of online scams like this (we are in the US).",No-Ebb6940,2,0,0.5
865,Leasing Manager asking for Brokerage Fee,11tcmyo,"My husband and I are trying to lease a property in NJ, USA. Here is a timeline for the events: 

March 1: My husband looks up properties in the preferred zip code and send inquiries to 2-3 properties within the area using websites such as rent.com, trulia.com. None of the agents respond (neither via text, phone call or email). 

March 2: I contact the leasing office of an apartment building that I am interested in, and take an appointment to visit the property on March 6. I use my contact (name, email, phone number) to make the appointment. 

March 6: My husband and I visit the property and the leasing manager (Let’s call her D) shows us the property. I ask what would be the charges due, and I am told of the 1.5 month deposit and application fee. No brokerage fee is mentioned. 

March 09: We apply for the apartment by paying a $100 fee (50 and 50 for my husband and me). 

March 10: Lease is created. The charges listed are: rent, deposit, application fee, one time annual recreation fee. No brokerage is mentioned on the lease. My husband and I sign the lease. 

March 15: The leasing manager (D) who also happens to be a realtor with a broker firm reaches out to me and asks for a one month brokerage fee. I inquire if this is standard practice for all the tenants renting with the property and why was I not told of this fee earlier - neither on the lease. She tells me that one of the inquiries that my husband made on March 1 had landed on her inbox - which means we have to now pay the brokerage fee to the realtor that she represents. The only evidence that she is able to share is the one inquiry form with my husbands email address in her email. 

I will note, she or anyone from this realtor service never reached out to my husband via email, or phone after the inquiry was raised. I called the leasing office and scheduled the viewing directly. The realtors did not provide us with any service at all. 

I denied paying brokerage fee as no service was taken and no written evidence was furnished. 

March 16: The lease is signed by the regional head (D’s boss) as is. The lease is executed. However, D reaches out via email again inquiring about our interest on the property else she will show it to someone else. I let her know that the lease was executed and that I don’t intend to pay the brokerage because no services were solicited. 

As far as I understand D is just trying to take advantage of the situation by matching my husbands name to something that she found on her database (which btw anyone can fill for anyone). I booked the appointment under my name directly with the leasing office. This appears to be a conflict of interest. 

Question: Does D have any basis to ask me for brokerage or are we good? Can she create problems for us when we move to the property because she is also leasing manager?",oddstar111,0,1,1.0

868,The company I work for (in CO) raised the starting salary and is changing titles of positions. My title and raise does not reflect the work I'm doing.,11tc8v4,"Hi all,

So this situation is a bit unique. I live and work in Colorado as I have just graduated college in 2022 and have been working at this specific company for 6 months now. 

This id a unique situation because my Company's market share went up, so upper management decided to raise the starting salaries of all positions. Not only did they do this, but in my department they are changing title and job roles, so everyone in our department is getting new titles and some are getting very substantial raises. 

A bit of background on me, i started in one specific role on our team that has had a bit of drama and politics with upper management (before i started). Upper management sees this role as 'transactional' and has had a lot of opinions and distaste for what im doing. I have a team of three. 

About a month ago, they decided to put me in a different role, with more responsibility and analysis. It has been great! The issue is these title changes come with salary changes. The starting salary for my first role is $10,000 less than what I am working on now. 

The issue is, my title is changing to the role i had originally started on, with my bump only being to the new starting salary. However, i am now in a different role with different expectations but am being paid for this other position I no longer do. 

The other issue, when asked about these title changes, there are no parameters, requirement, or job description to reflect either of these title changes and why they chose some people on my team for the higher pay and prestigious title vs why they chose this other role to put people into. 

It seems like they just picked and chose, and have no reasoning behind choosing specific titles for certain people, and cannot provide documentation to support these decisions. 

So basically my title is changing to this lesser role, although the work im doing falls under the higher paying role. I am the only one in this department that is incorrectly classified and making $10,000 less than the starting salary for the position. 

Any advice would be so so helpful, its a bit confusing so i apologize, but i have an official conversation with one of the big bosses tomorrow about my raise and title change and would just really like some advice on how to handle a situation like this as it is my first professional job out of college.

My wife and I bought a 5 acre parcel of land in Southern Colorado from a company online. It's not particularly valuable land: its pretty much an hour away from everywhere, and is just high desert valley land. So monetarily it's not worth much, but we love it and love the area. We made payments on it over 4 years (simple loan payments with no interest) for the total amount of $3600. We just made the final payment about a month ago.

The deed states: ""WITNESSETH, that the said grantor, for the consideration of Ten Dollars and other good and valuable consideration in hand paid, does hereby sell and convey the following described parcel of land...""

Did the seller commit contract fraud here? Or is the remaining $3590 considered the ""other good and valuable consideration in hand paid?""

879,"(NJ-USA) I paid $7,000 in CASH to someone for their car but they refuse to give it to me and deny I ever paid them. Chances of probable cause or something else? (Yes I'm a moron but please read and help me)",11tb61o,"I don't even know how to start this. And I'm scared to see any responses to this. Last month, a former co-worker, let's call him Frank, was offering me his car, a 2019 BMW x3 which had only about 40k miles for $7000 after he initially offered higher, but he eventually offered it for 7k. I was so stupid that after taking a short test drive, I paid him $7000 in cash thinking that he was legit. I don't know what in the world I was thinking. He said he'd give the car to someone, let's call him Joe for now, to clean it and get parts for it, and within 2 hours, the car would be ready for me along the title and registration. That never happened. Instead, Frank told me that he gave the whole $7000 to the person who was going to clean the car and that the person wasn't responding and he himself (Frank) was getting nervous. At that moment, I knew I had messed up, but he kept reassuring me that everything would be fine and there was nothing to worry about, as he'll get back in contact with joe. That was it for this night. I tried getting in contact with Frank, the person who I gave my money to the following day. He said that ""it might be over"" and that I couldn't get my money back, but he would try his best to retrieve it from Joe, the supposed third party.

Maybe 2 or 3 hours later, ""Joe"" texts me from a burner phone that cannot be tracked. He apologizes that he ran off with my $7k and asks for more money, and I end up sending $2,000 more dollars through PayPal, which I end up getting back, fortunately. The thing is that, as I texted Joe for a week or two on that burner number, he said twice in text that I gave Frank the $7k and that Frank gave him (Joe) the money. Keep in mind that there is no proof that Joe exists to this day, as he didn't want to call or meet because he has a ""speech disorder."" I once asked him if I could get the money back, but he sort of refused and then claimed that the $2000 that I sent him on PayPal was on hold, so he sent it back to me and expected me to send it to Frank so Frank can give it to him so he can get the $2k faster. As I am going through this, Frank advises me to send him more money because he still wants to do a deal with me but for a higher price, and I tell him no because I have no more money left. I was so desperate and stressed, still am. Eventually, I found out that the Cash App and PayPal that ""Joe"" has is under Frank's name and phone number. Frank gets angry and says he got to Joe, and Joe had me talk to his ""secretary,"" who happens to be Frank's on-and-off girlfriend, as I found out by looking up the secretary's phone number. It was obvious to me that there was no Joe and it was just Frank pretending to be somebody so he can get more money out of me.

I had recorded a couple of calls of me and him with me trying to get him to confess that I had given him the $7000 in cash but he always says that he doesn't have the money and then prevented me from implicating him by saying that he doesn't have the money and then ""pleads the fifth."" The closest that I got to in terms of voice calls is when I said ""I gave you my money in cash"" and he replied ""I understand that."" Another time is that when I said ""I paid you the money for the car"" and he said ""yea that's true but...."" and then he denied it right away after that. A lot of the phone calls were recorded and I could put them on a USB for the police.

I had filed a police report initially for the threats but also in hopes of getting this $7000 back. I have two text messages from Joe that implicate that I gave Frank the money. The police said it is possible that it can be fraud/swindling if proof is found. As the detective interviewed Frank he said that he was suspicious of how defensive Frank was, and asked Frank questions on how to find Joe and information about him but Frank refused to say anything, instead saying ""you're a detective figure it out yourself."" Essentially all the police did was ask Frank straight up ""do you have the $7000?"" but he denies it and says that I gave the money to Joe, who I never met and who does not exist. I gave Frank the $7000 cash. Frank acknowledged that I am $7000 short but he says he has nothing to do with it as he only connected me and Joe, which is not true by any means. Frank then reached out to me using another number saying that he's not even worried about the police.

As the police reached a dead end on asking him questions,  the detective said all I can do is just file a civilian complaint and the court will determine if there's probable cause in this case, and they'd be ready to make an arrest. I explained to the detective that I have texts which say that I gave Frank the money but he says that ""well Frank is denying it,"" which is pretty much what any criminal would say. I have texts of Frank saying ""you still want to buy my car?"" and him saying ""send 7k and I'll bring you the car right now"" which contradicts on what he probably told the detectives which is that he has nothing to do with this. I was told that I can submit whatever I have to court but I don't know what can be possibly done. One lawyer who practices in a another state says that it is possible that this could be a breach of contract case as well as possible fraud but I don't know. I know I'm an idiot for making this decision. It is the scariest situation I've been in my life, and I'm not even 20 yet. I am so lost on what to do and concerned that this is a person that can kill me as he has gang ties. It took a lot to go to the police about it and I am just scared that once I submit the civilian complaint, the court will reject it, and then it will really be over. I'm asking, what is the likely outcome of this and what can possibly happen? Is there any hope or luck that's on my side? And would I need a lawyer for this? 

Tldr: I got swindled out of $7000 in cash and have some small proof but am now due to file a civilian complaint and hope there's probable cause in it.

884,Custody and Child Support,11t122n,"My (recently ex) boyfriend and I have lived together for five years. We have an 8 month old son together. I was a teacher (I got pregnant my first year teaching) and he owns his own electrical company. He makes way more than I do. He makes enough to comfortably support our household AND pay his ex wife alimony (2,500 per month). 

Anyway, because he makes decent money, we decided when I got pregnant that I would take a year off (possibly more but definitely at least one year) to raise our son and take care of household duties while he works. He works out of town pretty frequently so I do a lot of the raising of our son alone.

Without getting into too many emotional details, he decided he wants to break up, which is devastating for both me and my son.

It also means I’ll need to move into my moms house AND he is now telling me he is not paying any child support because the support is supposed to be for our son, not me, and he will buy whatever our son needs. We have a joint bank account he is closing with nothing left in it. I’m a teacher, so I can’t return to work until August. He will not help me even until then and told me to find another job in the meantime. When I asked him who is supposed to watch our son who has spent every moment of his life with me, he told me that HE will stay home and watch our son and will hire someone to go to work for him. Absolutely destroys me to think about not being with my baby.

EDIT: my ex is also, what I would consider, an alcoholic. At least three nights a week he will stay up and party until sometime between 3-7am then sleep all day the next day (sometimes missing work). I am ALWAYS on night duty with our son and he regularly sleeps through his crying in the daytime too. I do not trust him to raise our son alone. I added these details because I’m also wondering if I had to get ugly with him, if I could use this information against him in court.

893,[US - MN] Abuse of power of attorney after death with little relation. Can we do anything?,11t9rvb,"Throw away account to keep this separate from my main.

So I have this situation in the family that I'm reaching out about, but I have no idea where to start. I'm not heavily involved and I'm just going off of hearsay, but they've been spinning wheels and unsure of what could be done.

My grandma lived with her long-time companion (M 80's) for at least 10 years. Unfortunately, she died about a year and a half ago in a house fire on his property that wasn't investigated well, but there wasn't much to investigate because the fire had completely burned out before anyone got there. The POA got the insurance check.

After that incident, the power of attorney took over $300k from the companion's bank account into his personal account (he was listed on the account). After looking online, it seems this would be an abuse of power of attorney/breach of fiduciary responsibility - but I'm not sure if there's a lot to go off of. The power of attorney also sold the companion's truck to buy a new car for POA's wife.

My late grandma's companion was upset at that, but also found out about this money was being pulled out of his account. So he asked my mom and a friend of his to be joint powers of attorney and signed paperwork to revoke the previous power of attorney. However, the bank refused to accept the new POA paperwork and the money drain continued to over $700k. The bank said they don't accept joint powers of attorney. He also found out his will was changed and didn't remember signing it (however he was old and the power of attorney would give him things to sign and the companion used to trust him). So the power of attorney and POA's family was in the will for almost everything he owned. The POA also added himself as co-owner of his land.

It was difficult to find a lawyer because the POA had talked to a lot of nearby lawyers, so they couldn't really get involved. When they found a lawyer that could talk with the companion, things were moving slowly and the companion's health was getting worse.

A few months ago, the companion died. But some members of my extended family are upset because they feel like this power of attorney took advantage of this guy. But they're curious if there's a way to dispute the will given that my late grandma and a few other people were in the older will and this whole situation seems messed up. If anything, they're looking to hold this guy accountable.

Side note: I was told this POA had done something similar to a different elderly person, too.

Questions:

Is there any action that can be taken on this, or is it too late? 

If any action can be taken, how financially practical is it to pursue - given my extended family doesn't really have a lot of money? Are there programs out there to help low-income people in cases like these?

Is my extended family close enough to this situation to be directly involved in it? The companion doesn't have any living relatives, and the people who were in the will don't want to get too involved.

Are there indirect ways they can get involved, like requesting the IRS probe and making sure this guy paid an inheritance tax or that an 8300 form was filed when the money was taken from the account?

My question: does my mother have a strong case for exemption? The only credits to their checking are from her wages. As I understand  it, she should be a candidate to claim exemption. They’re quite scared and unsure of what to do, especially since they have no money and no line aid credit.

Any help or guidance is much appreciated!

In that time we got in a massive fight, not uncommon with her, and we decided that living together wasn't a smart choice. She told me we would split the Monty fairly.

908,Upstairs tenants violating lease via constant noise and apartment manager is asking us for new deposit in order to move apartments even though it is not outlined in our contract.,11t85yi,"We (my girlfriend and I) moved into our apartment in October of 2022 and the tenants above us have not allowed us a day without excessive stomping/screaming/general banging since. To our understanding it is a family of 4 and we understand that noise is a simple fact of apartment living. There is a lot of noise throughout the day but it does not cease when quiet hours start (the kids and parents are often stomping/running around well into the night). We spoke with them early on but after complaining multiple times it was clear it was no use speaking to them. After each complaint our apartment manager has called them and informed them that they need to quiet down. At the 4th complaint she told us that she was going to issue them a formal lease violation and asked us if we could produce video evidence of the noise so that we could move apartments without having to pay the large transfer fee. We had been videoing since October so I sent over a file containing 40 videos. She got back with us pretty soon after that and said that she had sent the file to her regional manager and they would be able to waive the transfer fee. 

Here's where our issue starts: they want us to pay a new deposit. There is nothing in our lease that says we have to pay a new deposit for transfers. They will refund some of our first deposit within 30 days but essentially we'd be out $1,300 (non-refundable portion from first deposit+the new deposit). Also, who knows how much of the first deposit they'll actually refund if they decide that we've damaged the unit we are in now. In addition to these costs, rent for available units has increased so we'd be paying more in rent. On top of that we'd obviously have to bite any costs we incur while moving. It seems to us that they are essentially asking us to pay for our neighbors not abiding by the terms of their lease. We can either bite the bullet (of which we may not be able to afford any time soon) or continue to file complaints until the tenants above us have incurred the amount of lease violations necessary to warrant eviction (which even with the amount of anger they've caused us we don't want to have any part in). If it makes a difference we live at a property in Texas and I can provide the ownership group name to anyone who wants to PM. Does anyone have any advice on how we can transfer apartments without having to pay a brand new deposit?

She called the bank multiple times leaving voicemails to call her back, specifying the times she was available.

937,Reimbursement help? Im quite confused,11t5cmg,"Hey all! I am 2 year private homeowner in Arkansas. I live next to a university in my area. Earlier this year, a part of their property damaged my property more than once out of negligence. The representatives of the university came over after the 2nd time and saw the damages and told me to stay in good standings, they'd like to pay my insurance deductible to ease my burden and ""maintain a good neighbor relationship"".
So, today, 2 months after the damages, and me having to ask what's going on with my deductible repayment, they send me an email saying I need to be set up as a vendor and sent me a W-9 form to fill out. 
I don't think this is right to do. I don't work there, I am a private homeowner, and other than dealing with them to get them to fix what caused damages, I have no ties to them, aside from being neighbors. 

Is this the right way to go about it? It's not an absurd amount of money (a deductible) and it seems like maybe they're trying to not do this the right way? I don't want to be extra taxed on it, and it's definitely not income, it's reimbursement. 
Anyone have any experience with this?",Alive-Can4750,8,0,0.5
938,Taking Fiancés Hyphenated Last Name,11sz6gw,"I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for my question so if it’s not I would like advice on where to post. I am in California. 
My fiancé and I just got engaged and I was looking for advice about taking his last name. When he was born, they messed up on his birth certificate. What was supposed to be his middle name (his mothers maiden name) ended up being hyphenated with his fathers last name on accident and they didn’t realize the mistake until he was in middle school and never fixed it. Example: his last name should have been just Smith but instead was Morgan-Smith. But, since his dad hasn’t been in the picture his entire life, he’s always socially gone by the last name Morgan, and the both of us only have a connection to that last name. My fiancé hasn’t wanted to go through the name change process to legally make his last name just Morgan because he hasn’t felt like he needed a reason to yet. My question is, when we get married and eventually have children, can we choose to only take the first part of his hyphenated name or will he have to get his name legally changed before we get married so me and my children don’t get stuck with the hyphenated last name? Could we both just legally change it to what we want after our wedding? Any help would be appreciated.",Kitchen_Cook_6225,2,2,1.0
939,Housing conditions advice Texas,11t56j2,"Need advice in Galveston County Texas.


My children are very good friends with  kids who live in deplorable conditions. 

Single mom, low income/receives assistance, no child support, possible intellectual disabilities. She ""rents"" a trailer from her uncle who is a pastor at a local church. I'm unsure if she rents the trailer or is only required to pay lot rent (I believe the latter), but the deed is in his name. He knows the conditions they live in. He only does repairs when the county gets involved or he gets sick of her complaints. 

When I say deplorable I do not mean a sink full of dishes or piled up laundry, I mean the trailer needs to go as it's unrepairable. It's full of black mold, you can smell it when you enter the home. One of the kids is on breathing treatments and misses school regularly because of ""attacks"". Mom bleaches, but I have explained it's beyond what she can see. There are holes in their floors in various rooms, construction debris all over the yard, the kids constantly experience minor injuries from the conditions. I put an end to my kids going over the play a year ago because it's unsafe. We recently attended a birthday party and that's when I learned of that black mold smell and the recent bs he told her. She needed a new front door because it wouldn't close. The flooring and walls surrounding the door are rotting because of rain entering the home for months. The new door was not installed properly, the frame is partially disconnected from the house and you can see the outside. Her told her it was $800 to repair and I believe he exaggerates so she will not ask for further help. The new door jammed, when she called for his help he wouldn't return her calls. Last year she had a septic issue that he wouldn't repair until someone called the county on them. He knows how they live, he attends parties too and I see the disgust on his face, yet he allows it to continue. 

During the party I stressed that she should move, but I understand our situations are different so it's easier said than done. Her fear is becoming homeless so she never wants to rock the boat. She stated he had someone at the church filed her taxes, she's unsure of what she's getting back because they did not tell her and he has the card her money is to be deposited on. He does not have any legal authority over her, going back to her intellectual disabilities. She believes it's somewhere around $10k. My fear is that someone is going to make the call the CPS and this will all blow back on her. I do not want the kids to be taken away, but something needs to be done. 

In my position, knowing she's unwilling to rock the boat and take advice, how should I proceed? Again, I stress, I do not want to involve CPS. I've thought about contacting the uncle myself, but I fear there will be retaliation against her and the kids because I do not trust him. Is there anyway he can be held legally responsible for this? Who can I report him to? How do I go about this so the kids and her can receive the living conditions they desperately need? I fear that it's coming to a head. It only takes the wrong/right person seeing the state of the home and making a call.",flyingyogurt3390,2,1,1.0
940,Divorce Settlement Wording Questions - Visitation By Possessory Parent - Texas Family Law,11t52w0,"Info: Throwaway Account. I am the Mom's Husband.

Background: I have a divorce settlement signed by both parties, their attorneys, and a judge in TX. It is less than 2 years old. Mom is Primary Conservator, Dad is Possessory Conservator, of young child.

There were many, MANY drafts and revisions to this order before all parties signed. Some errors appear to have been made in drafting that were never caught, not even for $400/hr. Now that it is signed, everyone seems to think it meant something else. In minor issues that Mom and Dad couldn't resolve by mutual agreement, the parents would be expected to revert to the ""letter of the Order.""

&#x200B;

Dad put his foot down about an extra 3 hours visitation with the child, recently, stating that even though all possession transfers for 18 months have taken place at or about 3pm when school would normally facilitate the exchange, since this one paragraph mistakenly still contained a ""6pm"" exchange he intended to keep the child until then. This threw all kinds of wrenches into Mom's plans for that day. She said if he wouldn't work with her, she would no longer work with him.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to Extended Summer Possession. The Order states: ""Beginning in 2022 and in even-numbered years thereafter"" Dad gives notice to Mom and gets 30 days summer possesion... The next subsection details that Mom gets to, with notice, ""...override any regular weekend possession by Dad during the summer of a year.""

&#x200B;

The QUESTION is about the ""letter of the Order."" As read, it seems a detail was left out. The intent was to flip flop which parent got to choose summer possession dates first on any given year, identified by odd or even numbered years. As written, signed, and proven up in court to a judge, it reads as though Dad gets extended summer possession *only in even numbered years*, and Mom gets here time *every year.*

&#x200B;

If Mom holds Dad accountable to the document all parties agreed to voluntarily, and denies him extended time this summer, because it is an odd-numbered year, CAN MOM GET IN TROUBLE?

&#x200B;

The goal is to bring dad to heel on being an a-hole. Mom would be happy revising the order with Dad to correctly state what the original intent had been and not involving attorneys, but if Dad says no... denying summer vacation for him is Mom's leverage. What things need to be considered for this???",Quirky_Feedback_254,3,1,1.0
941,"Confused about receiving a check with no context from former employer that includes an earnings statement with categories that were not on my other statements: ""Waiting Pay"" under Reimbursements, and ""Post-Tax Deductions"" and ""PYOT"" under it, the amount matching the check. Oregon, USA.",11t4zw5,"I just received a check in the mail from my former employer, with no context I can fully understand. While I would love to run to the bank and deposit, it, I don't know if I should, if my former employer will claim that they sent it to me on mistake. I'm under the impression that this must be due to some behind the scenes action, internally within the company, and possibly as a result of a complaint I made to Oregon BOLI over being paid at a lower rate that I agreed to during my interview (not that I ever got it in writing what I agreed to or made a wage claim), being rescheduled to not work the last two weeks I agreed to without notification of this rescheduling, and receiving my final paycheck later than the date I said would be my last day in my two weeks notice.

On the earnings statement, it still states the same pay rate as my other earnings statements. Under Hours/Units, it states the accrued PTO, and amount of money it's worth. Under reimbursements, it includes ""Waiting Pay,"" which was not on any of my other earnings statements. There's another section on it that wasn't on my other statements: ""Post-Tax Deductions, and under it ""PYOT,"" and this is the number matches what is on the check to be cashed. I guess PYOT means payout, but I don't understand what these two new categories mean on this statement.

Right now, I don't understand why this check was sent to me, of who authorized it and why. I feel reluctant to call up my former employer for an explanation but I will if I'm recommended to, though I would appreciate advice on how to got about that. I never got a response from the BOLI about the complaint I made on their website other than what I think is an auto-generated email confirming the complaint I submitted. The email does include a phone number to get in touch with them through, so I think I will call that number and ask when I can expect a response from them, and if they know anything about this check that was sent to me.

Her name is on the mortgage and the deed, and her husband who just recently left is only on the deed. She wasn't sure about adding him because things hadn't been going well for a while but she was pressured to. She was the one who put the down payment on the house and the husband provided no means to buy the home. Now he's gone and he says he'll continue to pay some of the mortgage but this is soly because he wants the equity on the house that he didn't even buy. They also have kids who she needs help caring for but he said he doesn't have more to give. But when someone suggested taking his name off the deed and using the money for the kids, since he didn't help buy the home anyways, he was outraged and said no. We did research and know we can't remove him from the deed w/o his consent, we thought about adding her two children who aren't his biologically to the deed so if the house equity is split equally the kids can give their portion to the mother but we also can't do that w/o his permission.

&#x200B;

At this point, I'm trying to think of unconventional legal ways of making sure my friend will be able to keep all the equity in the house. I don't know if she can take the equity out because she's the only one on the mortgage. I'm just trying to think of legal loopholes at this point.

I drove it around the block and now first gear was grinding also. So I parked it and until I was able and brought it to a popular and well reviewed auto shop. I told them what happened and my concerns and they said they'd check it out. 

Keep in mind this was a new transmission with ~30,000 miles on it. I had it replaced at a transmission shop 3 years prior and hadn't put  many miles on it, however the 2 year warranty was now expired.  

The well reviewed auto shop had the truck for about 2 weeks, fixed some minor things(loose ignition relay thermostat), they test drove it, putting about 20 miles on it and said they couldn't find anything wrong with the transmission and that I should drive it to work for the next two weeks and touch base if I have any more concerns.  When I picked up the vehicle I drove it around a bit, took it on the highway and it seemed okay.

957,Medical negligence?,11t45kv,"Misdiagnosed & mistreated by getting over 20 injections into my lips but no serious injury. Would a lawyer even take?


I had lip filler done on 03/14 and had complications. I woke up with extreme pain, burning and swelling in middle of night. I called the clinic the next morning 03/15 and went in. They stated it was a vascular occlusion which is a rare medical emergency (less than 1%) 3 nurse practitioners there have never seen it before. They printed a protocol and began to try injecting my lips without even telling me what they were doing, risks of the acid dissolver they were injecting to fix their mistake or the plan. They had no idea what they were doing. They had to call in a trainer from Lincoln to come assist (after 20 injections and 5 hours of trying) and then also consulting with their regional trainer over the phone who was also unable to fix the problem. Typically the standard of care is 1 vial of dissolver to 1 vial of filler. I only had 1 vial of filler so it should have taken 1 vial of dissolver not 14. The right side of my lip where they injected 1 vial of dissolver worked completely. There was no doctor that ever saw me that day. I was in clinic over 8 hours with over 4 people injecting 30 times into my lip with no numbing medications/pain medications. They did 14 vials of dissolver when initially they told me 12 was the max in 24 hours then they changed that. They did not get it resolved that day but since clinic was closing they had me go home and want me to come back the next day for the chief medical officer (who is a doctor) to evaluate. They discouraged me from going to ER as they said I would have to wait and “time is tissue” and that they would not have the right tools. They did not have a handheld ultrasound machine in clinic which is the way to find the occlusion and verify it is in fact one. I believe medical malpractice was for sure in play and not to mention the HIPPA violations. I do have a witness to this as my aunt came after a couple hours and saw all of this. It was pure torture. 
When I went home,after 2 hours since last injection, my lip was much improved (see the Dr comment later) 
I went the next day to different clinic and saw a facial surgeon who said it was most likely not a vascular occlusion and they did over 12 vials and 20 injections that were not needed. I went back to ideal images 3/16 and their own chief medical Dr said that it was not an occlusion and likely fluid and blood pressing on a vein. I asked why would they keep injecting dissolver adding more fluid and inflammation to the area and he could not explain why they continued to inject dissolved except for “they followed protocol” (mind you the protocol was for the WRONG DIAGNOSIS) He did say the protocol is wrong as heat being applied made the situation worse and it should be ice. The clinic used the wrong protocol and misdiagnosed. Had this doctor been called in the day I was in clinic he could have saved me over 20 injections, 12 vials of dissolver in my face and EXTREME pain. They were not trained and did not have access to a professional 

They also broke hippa as my picture was on a computer screen easily seen walking through the clinic by others. They also showed me my pics on a handheld tablet and had to swipe past another patients photos as well. No discharge paperwork was given. I felt like a lab rat being poked over and over. It very much seemed like they were concerned about the clinic and not about me or my skin. My skin did go blue/purple/black and was dying.

I applied to this school in Germany for an MBA. I've been talking to their student recruitment team for the past 3 weeks. They told me, because of my outstanding achievements, they'll give me a 25% discount. I said I'm thrilled to hear the news because I needed this scholarship. I wrote the new monthly price and the total, asked them to confirm it and they said yes, you'll pay that amount. You can see the exchange below:

> *Thank you for sending in your documents. I confirm your application documents are complete and I can proceed with your application.*  
  
>  
>*I discussed this with our admission team and you will be getting a extra scholarship ( 25%) due to your excellent profile. The tuition fee reduces to 668 Euros monthly.* 

My answer:

> *That is excellent news! Thank you so much! Does that mean my total payment is 12.024€ (668 x 18)?* 

Their reply:

> *Yes the tuition fee will be 668 Euros x 18)* 

Fast forward to today, I applied officially last week and today I got a mail telling me I got accepted. They sent me an offer letter to sign but on the offer letter, the price is untouched, no scholarship. I asked if this is a mistake. Here is their answer:

> *Thank you for your email. There was a miscommunication. My apologies for that. Few selected promising candidates are able to get the 500 Euros tuition discount. The 25% discount ended at the end of December. It was replaced with a 500 Euros discount.*   
  
>  
>*Hence the offer letter that was sent to you by our admission team is correct.* 

I've made all my plans and arrangements according to that scholarship. Now I'm screwed. Since I have all this written in emails, do I have a legal ground? Can I force their hand into giving me that scholarship? They basically lured me with a 3,000€ discount, now they are telling me they are giving me 500€, and that is only if I pay the ""campus fee"" in advance. This is ridiculous.

980,NYS Surprise Medical Billing Question,11tbt8v,"I will try to keep it concise. I live in New York State (USA).
For about a year I was attending therapy with a licensed therapist who moved early on in our contact from one practice to another. During that transition the only piece of information I was provided in writing (or verbally) was one letter from my therapist stating that the change would have little impact on our sessions. There was no mention, in-writing or otherwise (documented) of the new practice being out-of-network. When I first found my therapist, I knew and was informed that his practice then was in-network and covered by my insurance. The entire time, my therapist 
was sending me (well-documented) statements that had my copay listed as $10, which I paid off faithfully.

A few months ago my therapist abruptly ended contact and I lost all contact with him. Some time later I received an email stating that he had left the practice and nothing else. 

Today I received an email stating that I had an unpaid copay bill of several hundred dollars. The email stated that they knew my therapist had misquoted the cost but that the real copay cost had been over $60 per session. 
I had no reasonable way of knowing this cost; my insurance was not providing me with statements to this effect (stating that I “may” owe such and such) nor was my therapist.
To me, it’s a breach of informed consent; I gave no informed consent to this price. I’m not in a financial place where I can just cough up the debt.

I am also wondering if this qualifies for new york state’s protections for surprise medical billing.

I made an app as a hobby a couple of months ago and it gained traction. Now, after 3 months it's doing quite well.

I received an email from the creator of my biggest competitor today stating that my app was infringing on his intellectual property. Specifically he believes that the logo, design and concept are similar. He has (in kind words) threatened me with a lawsuit.

The concept and features which I believe are similar in both apps:

You post a selfie, you add your Snapchat username to your profile and your post is added to a grid of other posts (a feed). People can add your Snapchat from your profile. Premium features include being able to filter posts by gender and the ability to boost your post to the top of the feed for a certain amount of time.

There are other features which are unique to my app and his app that I've not included.

So my question is, can the above be considered intellectual property? Do I need to get a lawyer? Or is this just a bigger competitor trying to scare me?

The competitor is based in a different country than me and I'm not sure how to deal with this.

Logo issues:

My logo is a wink face with tongue sticking out inside a chat bubble with a different border style and colours than my competitor.

The competitors is a smiley face inside a solid colour chat bubble with a tongue sticking out.

Would this be considered an intellectual property infringement?

6,What is the punishment for driving alone with a learner's permit?,11vy06a,"I am sixteen and a half and want to start driving. The only thing is, I get my learner's permit later this week and that means that I would have to wait nine months in order to get my full-fledged driver's license and be able to drive alone legally.

The official DMV website states that one can drive alone with a learner's permit if:

\- they are 16 years and 3 months old;

\- they have a form filled out by their parents; and

\- have held your permit for nine months.

I can fulfill all of these obligations except the last one. So hypothetically, what happens if a police officer catches me driving alone or with someone while having only a learner's permit? I read that it would lead to a 6 month driving suspension and some demerit points, which I am totally fine with. The only thing I don't want is a misdemeanor on my record or anything that would affect my parents situation (such as imprisonment for them).

&#x200B;

For reference, I live in Virginia. Also, I don't want to here any moral arguments here. I will not start doing this the day I get a learner's permit. I would do it when I know I am good enough and when my parents agree with me. Just please explain to me what the police would do if I was caught.",Throwaway9888273,11,1,1.0

14,Can I Take My Former Roommate To Court?,11vxia2,"Trigger warning: Mentions of sexual assualt and self harm

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

About a year ago a roommate I lived with in college sexually assualted me and harrassed me for months. He had claimed it was due to his mental illnesses but after talking to people with these mental illnesses they informed me that it had absolutely nothing to do with that and that he was only using it as an excuse for his actions. He never took his prescribed medicines for the issues he suffered with but instead would use drugs instead because he believed they worked better. When I confronted him about it he became incredibly defensive and aggresive about it. Dealing with him like this constantly forced me into a depression and I was unable to complete any of my courses or really take care of myself. Eventually I got the courage to speak out against him to our friends online as I wasn't able to communicate to them in person. He used that to his advantage and would delete my messages and make it so I couldn't communicate with them and would then tell them that I had sexually assualted him and for months went on to slander and harrass me. He even threatened to kill himself to put me in prison when I showed people proof. Since then I've had many issues with my health both physically and mentally and often have anxiety attacks due to all of this. I am also no longer able to receive aid to take my college classes because I previously failed them, and if I don't pay for this semester soon I will be forced to drop out. I cannot transfer to another school because of my current status academically and financially with the college either. I talked to the college and they said they would fix my ability to receive aid but that was the first week of the semester and now there's only about a month left of class and I don't believe they actually will. He has since admitted to it recently and gave me some money to ""make up"" for it (for anonymity its less than $500). He no longer attends the same college as me so there is nothing that can be done regarding that. Is there anything I can do? I don't have money or work and I don't want my family to know about this which is why I've held off but its come to a point where something needs to happen. I don't feel it's fair that he gets to walk away from this while I'm forced to deal with the issues it has caused me everyday. I worry for anyone else he comes in contact with because I'm not the first he's done this too and I know I won't be the last. I live in Ohio.",yoinkysploinky69420,3,1,0.67

17,Apartment complex adds unwanted amenities and increases rent,11vx7gi,"Hello, I would be grateful for any insight. My mother has lived in the same apartment building for 20 years. It is owned by a major rental company in our city, they own hundreds of properties, ranging from small, 4-family buildings to massive high rises. Naturally, over time there have been several rent hikes, but this last one feels particularly egregious. They went ahead and signed up for the services of a particularly awful telecom outfit, the kind that requires installing a big ol’ dish on the roof of her building. They wired up every apartment and added something like $80 to the monthly rent. 

The most concerning part is that they made it mandatory. As in, my mother is welcome to continue using her preferred provider, but she’ll just be paying for both. Now, I’m not an unreasonable person, and for the most part I try to pick my battles, but unfortunately switching to the new service won’t work. She needs reliable internet for work, and “reliable” just isn’t something that the roof-saucer people could claim with a straight face. 

I am not an attorney, and my understanding of tenancy laws is dismal. Presumably, the apartment folks could just call it a regular rent increase, thus playing off the telecom thing as providing a lovely service for free? Can they raise the rent mid-lease?

I called my insurance company and asked for a tow truck to pick me up and was offered a rental car.

23,Help! Living trust inheritance question.,11vwvhx,"I’m hoping someone on here can help me out. My grandpa passed away last November, and he had a living trust where he named his 3 children to inherit his assets. When my dad died he changed it so that my sister and I would split my dad’s share. My uncle is in charge as the executor of the living trust. It has been almost 5 months and none of us have received anything or been notified of anything until I demanded a copy of the trust a couple months ago mentioning lawyers and finally my sister and I were emailed a copy. When I reach out to him, he just tells me that he’s “working on it.” The trust states that all belongings, unless specified in a written form are to be sold and the money split between us. There is no written document stating that anything specifically goes to anyone, and I confirmed this with my uncle. This has not happened as my uncle has given away several items to the other beneficiaries and random other people. He donated several things as well, and has given my sister, my grandpas truck and travel trailer and my grandmothers heirloom wedding ring. He also sold my grandpas car months ago before he died and I don’t know where that money went. He has also kept expensive paintings that were my grandpas for himself. All of this, without discussing it with the rest of us. I have no idea what assets are available in any accounts that my grandpa may have had but I do know we are all supposed to split them and that my uncle is supposed to sell the house “as is” and we are supposed to agree on a sale price together and split the money as part of our inheritance as well. He has not listed the house yet and just keeps telling me he’s working on the house even though he is supposed to sell it as is. My sister doesn’t care to speak up as she was given the truck, camper and the wedding ring so she’s fine. She states that my grandpa wanted her to have these items and told her this by word of mouth. It has caused more of an issue between us because I don’t necessarily care that she has them if my grandpa really wanted her to have them. My issue is that it’s not written in the trust that she could have them, and it specifically states in the trust that if something isn’t written down, that the items are to be sold and split between us. I’m not sure why my other uncle hasn’t spoken up, we aren’t in contact. 

ETA: 6 months before my grandpa passed away my uncle called me out of nowhere, and offered to buy me out of my inheritance for a pretty lowball amount. He use the excuse that perhaps I needed it to use as a down payment on a house, and that my sister was really hard up for money and needed it. He said the only way that he could buy us out of our inheritance as if we both agreed since we share my dad’s share of it I declined and told him that I wanted the trust to be executed the way it was meant to be.

I’m just trying to figure out what my rights are as a beneficiary to help move this along. 

As well as what rights I may have in the fact that he is going against what the trust instructions are, and giving away items without permission from all of us. 

Also, wondering if I am allowed to have access to know what the balances are in any accounts that my grandpa may have had.

And lastly when I finally receive my inheritance from any accounts and the sale of the home do I have to pay taxes on the inheritance? (Living will is in California and I know live in Arizona).

24,Our landlords never put us on the lease (OR),11vwt9f,"Hey everyone! I'm in my first apartment right now and I'm not entirely sure what my rights are here. My partner and I took over a lease last June. It's a 2 bed, so we replaced one tenant and the remaining one stayed. We signed all the papers, they said we were on the lease.

Then, in January, our roommate (last remaining tenant on initial lease) moved out  and we learned that we were never signed onto the lease. They assured us they'd fix it, and that they would vouch for our residence history later (which is a concern for us as we are young and don't have a lot going for us as tenants). So when we went to sign our new roommate on, we asked for a printed copy of the rental agreement, to ensure that all of our names were on it. They gave us a 2 year old document from the very beginning of the lease - so ALL old tenants. None of those people live here anymore, and no current tenants are on it as the lease has since been fully turned over. We went BACK to the office to once again discover that NONE OF US ARE ON THE LEASE.

30,"Former landlord trying to collect a ""debt"" from me after I was evicted",11vwjuq,"Sorry for the following long story: 

I rented a unit in an apartment complex for about 2 years, the last year I was there I didn't really renew my lease for another full year, but instead did a month-to-month renting situation where I paid an extra fee every month on top of normal rent amount to keep staying there (the reason for the month-to-month was due to job transitioning and I wasn't sure if I was going to be relocated in that time). My unit was the bottom floor (pretty much the basement area of the building) and the last six months I was there (roughly June 2019) I had a pretty major water leak. I called maintenance numerous times to get it fixed, they eventually did (but not really as you'll soon see) but I had a huge water bill tacked onto my August month rent (about $500 if I recall correctly). I figured this had something to do with the leak as my normal water bill was around $60-100 per month. I called the administration office and told them to fix my water bill as it was obviously incorrect. They said they would deduct from my following rent bills. Well, they technically did deduct some money from the bills but, I kid you not, they literally deducted PENNIES from the bill. So like 2 cents here, 6 cents there, and there was no significant reduction at all from my rent bills. I guess they thought they could deduct the least amount of money and carry this out for DECADES on end??? I have no clue but I was pretty ticked off. I obviously contacted the office again and they tried to play it down, continueed to NOT fix the problem. So by November I had HAD it with them (there had been various other problems with them that aren't relevant to the story so I won't include everything here) and I told the office manager I refuse to pay the next rent bill until they fix the refund/deduction problem and I wasn't going to continue to letting them just give me literal pennies back for the next 50 years to pay back what they owed me. The leak was NOT my fault, the buildings were somewhat old and outdated (built in early 1980's) and according to the maintenance guy, they needed serious updating. Come November 30th, I receive an eviction notice giving me until December 6th (2019 still)to get out. I had one week to find a new place and move all my stuff out, but managed to do it with the help of my boyfriend luckily and moved in with him. It sucked having such little time to do it but I was actually relieved to leave that place and all the stress it was causing me. I figured the deposit was theirs to keep since the carpets had to be torn up to air out the flooding the leak was causing (even though the leak wasn't my fault), and I had a cat that tore up a section of carpet around the bedroom door. If I remember correctly the deposit was around $900. Other than the carpeting, everything else seemed fine to me and I cleaned up as much as I could before I had to leave. 

Well jump to August of 2022 I receive a letter from a collection agency wanting $2000 on behalf of the apartment complex I dealt with back in 2019. This is the only letter or notice I've ever gotten regarding the issue, I've received nothing (no phone call, no email, no letter) from the apartment complex company directly. From the research I've done, I can apparently demand an itemized account of this $2000 they're saying I owe them, I assume in damages or whatever reason they are trying to pin it on. Again, nothing is detailed out in this collection of debt letter, just the amount I supposedly owe and where to send the money to. I've been sitting on it, not doing anything about it yet considering it didn't seem to have any legal backing behind it......yet.

Today I received a letter from an attorney's office with the same type of info as the debt collection agency letter, one page just stating the amount and where to send the money to. 

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to proceed from here, do I consult a real estate attorney? Can I dispute these charges of debt? Is this attorney's office pursuing legal /court action against me? Do I just pay the debt and chalk it up to a hard lesson learned? Any help is GREATLY appreciated! TIA",pinkcook4,0,1,1.0
31,Options for a minor (15) undergoing neglect,11vwjkc,"Hello all, apologies in advance if this seems foolish, I'm just looking for some info. I'm not going to go into the details that likely wouldn't affect anything, and stick to the main point. I'm close to an individual who is a minor (15) and is undergoing neglect. Nothing directly physically abusive, but just to a point where she could be seen unfit to be a mother. Some info that I believe could important are:

- She has many physical illnesses that make her unable to parent her children effectively
- The mother has history of weed usage (in NC, not legalized yet), and has used the drug while being the guardian of the minor
- The mother is verbally abusive, actively swearing, insulting, and degrading the minor.
- The mother has no stable income or job, and the only source of income she has comes from an ex boyfriend who is in no way legally obligated to provide that support. 
- The mother makes no effort to be responsible or take a caretaking role the minors, she does not make an effort to clean, cook, or otherwise take care of her children other than making purchases for food, clothes, etc. using the aforementioned source of income. 
- She is a single mother, with no other stable partner to assist in taking care of the child.

I brought the phone in and was really steered towards a 3rd party haddware replacement. Once they replaced the screen, the screen was so dark that it was almost unusable. Think of the darkest your screen can get - that was now the maximum brightness. More importantly, the camera no longer worked and the phone kept crashing. I spoke with them and they agreed to put the old screen back in and try to fix the issues.

Now that they've put the original screen back in, the phone is still crashing repeatedly, and the camera still doesn't work. I called them today and they refused to even entertain the idea that they caused these problems and that they're happening because it was dropped.

38,Neighbors septic pipe in yard while building fence,11vvoto,"We bought our house in a rural area of Georgia mid-2019.




We just got a survey done a month ago since we'd like to fence in our property. (1 acre +). Last survey was done in 1980, our houses were built later in 1988.




After the survey we found that the neighboring property has what looks like a septic pipe about 5-10 feet within our property. 




The neighboring property is a vacant house and has been vacant since we moved in.




We're still planning on putting field fencing and tposts along our property lines, regardless of the pipe. This seems like path of least resistance and will stake our claim of land properly.




We'd rather not pursue any legal action against the neighbor since nobody lives there and we'd have to pay a lawyer to track them down. We just want to have the field fencing as a physical boundary of our property lines to prevent any possible encroachment issues in the future.




We figure the neighbor will have to deal with this when/if they ever decide to sell.




Is their anything we are not considering?

39,Employer Told Me to get FMLA Documentation Instead of Just Letting Me Go Back to Work After Short Hospital Stay,11vvmus,"I was in a crisis stabilization hospital for a week, and when I got out, I’d received an email from HR stating I had until March 2nd to complete FMLA documentation to excuse me from work. They said I would also need a doctors note before I could return to work from FMLA leave. The earliest appointment I could get with a psychiatrist was 3 weeks after I was discharged from the hospital, and I wasn’t working since I hadn’t been cleared to go back. My psychiatrist completed my FMLA documentation, but when I turned it in, HR said it excused my absences for the dates I was in the hospital, but not the 3 weeks I spent waiting for my appointment. My psychiatrist won’t say I was incapacitated for those 3 weeks since I could have worked, but only didn’t because HR required a doctors note. So now they are going to terminate me because I have 3 weeks of unexcused absences. 

The worst part of this is, I never wanted to take FMLA leave in the first place. I had a doctors note from the hospital and enough paid sick leave to cover that week. But my manager took me off the schedule for the following week and I got the email from HR so I assumed that I had to take FMLA leave. After rereading the email, I can’t tell if they were saying I HAD to take FMLA leave, there just wasn’t another option so I assumed I had to take it. The email just explained FMLA, said I was eligible for it, and said, “This form [FMLA certification] will need to be completed by your health care professional and returned to me within 15 days.  Please have the certification form faxed back to me by March 2nd.”

Based on the quote above, did I have the option to just use sick leave and not deal with FMLA? Can an employer require you to take FMLA after being out only a week? Do I have any recourse once they terminate me? My company has a (undocumented) history of discrimination against people with mental illness, and I suspect that’s playing a role here.

44,Crazy lady keeps putting parking stickers on cars in our own lot,11vvf7y,"Hi legal people! I have the weirdest scenario going on, and I'm wondering what we can do about it once we've gathered all the evidence.

My fiance and I have lived in our apartment complex for nearly 3 years now. The complex is huge, so there's a couple of small lots for extra parking, plus everyone has a garage and a spot in front of their garage. My fiance and I have 3 vehicles since he has a work van, so we always have at least one parked in the small lot at the end of our building. This particular lot has two spots with ""Reserved for hikers"" (nothing about towing) signs, as there is a teeny tiny (0.5mi) trail behind our building. The trail is owned by a conservation group that has a number of trails in the area, including a massive preserve literally at the other end of our road - point being, no one uses this tiny trail except for the complex residents. For the most part everyone tries not to use the two hiking spots, but occasionally the lot gets full in the evening and people have to park in the two empty spots. Considering it's currently winter and there's snow everywhere, plus the trial is closed at night, this should not be an issue. I've seen the conservation's truck come by twice, ever.

So the issue begins back in the fall. My fiance was working a busy call shift, and he parked his van in the hiker spots from 8pm to midnight, then worked the full next day. At noon his company got a call saying that one of their vans was parked illegally on private property and would be towed. They of course called him to make sure he wasn't broken down somewhere, and we realized the caller was talking about the hiking spots in our own parking lot. I called our leasing office, who had no clue what we were talking about and confirmed that they a) don't monitor those parking spaces and b) would never tow a tenant's vehicle without first calling us directly. A few weeks later he was parked in the hiking spot again overnight, and when he left in the morning found a note on his van telling him not to park there. His company again got a call from the same lady, and the secretary tried to get more info out of her. This psycho lady refuses to give a name and says she doesn't live in the complex, she just visits a friend there. Time goes by, I get one note on my car and my fiance gets a note on his car, we throw them in the trash.

Then, two weeks ago, I had left my car parked in the hiking spots during a very snowy weekend and came out to find a bright green parking sticker on my windshield right in the middle of the driver's line of sight. It said I was parked in reserved area but the ""tow by"" section was blank. Getting it off was horrid, it took half an hour of scraping plus windex and rubbing alcohol. Last night my in laws were staying over, and when we went out to get dinner we noticed a neighbor was parked in the hiker spots and had a note hanging from the rearview mirror saying ""If you put another amazon parking sticker on my truck I'll sue you for harassment. You're on camera"" Genius. We come back from dinner, the only parking spot is the other hiking spot, so FIL parks there. This morning there's the same fucking sticker on their windshield in the same place. Takes just as long to remove. Now we're pissed and plotting revenge. The conservation is closed cuz it's Sunday and I'm 99% sure it's not them, but tomorrow I'll call them and our leasing office to cover our bases. My fiance is out buying a motion activated dashcam.

So, next time she puts a sticker on our cars and we catch her on camera, what can we do?

PS. If you search ""amazon parking stickers"" it's the amazon's choice green ones

&#x200B;

TLDR: Crazy lady with no authority keeps putting parking stickers on our cars for parking in ""reserved"" hiking spots in our own parking lot while the trail is closed. What legal recourse do we have? You can't just slap a sticker on someone's car because you don't like where they parked even though it's not your property, right??

I ended up coming out when I found out information that led me to believe he abused his own children as well.

With the owners' permission but independently 

I want to hand out brochures to the nearest public health center, where they have free STI/STD tests. I would do this on the property of the club.

And in addition, to promote awareness, if a member would show me they’ve had been tested recently, I would give them a wrist band. My hope is that this wrist band will cause others to ask about it and spread would of mouth.

My concern is what if someone interprets someone wearing the wrist band as “STD free” and then contracts something. Or if someone was able to deceive me with proof of their test and received a wrist band and then deceived others with it. 

Would I be liable for any of this?

**Part B**: Here's some information from Membership Terms and Conditions for a specific club I'm targeting that might be relevant.

\>If XXX club must employ an attorney to defend the owners because of an alleged violation by a Member of XXX club and or any person associated with the club, the Member agrees to **hold harmless** the owners, the owners of the real estate occupied and **all persons associated** (employees, vendors, website hosts, website designers, etc) with the club.<

But I'm not a Member, employee, etc. On the other hand, I will obtain and have permission from the owners.

Here's more Membership Terms and Conditions from same club:

All Members agree that if you engage in any physical activity, you do so at your own risk.<

Brainstorming a way to reduce risk on a Real Estate Portfolio..   


I am the sole owner of *Company 1 LLC* that owns a portfolio of residential real estate. All of the properties that are owned by *Company 1 LLC* are free and clear of any debt. I personally did a shareholder loan to *Company1 LLC* to acquire the real estate. I have been taking a distribution to pay myself back. But the company still has a lot of equity.  


That said, Id like to reduce my risk in this company by pulling majority of equity out of all of the properties with a portfolio loan / mortgage of some sort.  


I was thinking about starting a 2nd LLC that I would also be the sole owner of... *Lending Company LLC*

  
*Lending Company LLC* would create a mortgage and do a portfolio loan to *Company 1 LLC* for say 90% of the value of all the properties. Then *Company 1 LLC* would use that money to repay my personal shareholder loan that I loaned to *Company 1 LLC* to buy the properties. This would also wipe out all of the equity in these properties.  


Moving Forward: *Company 1 LLC* would pay *Lending Company LLC* a monthly mortgage payment ( with a small interest rate ) moving forward. Just like a traditional bank loan. Rather than repaying my shareholder loan directly to me.  


The idea is that If any of the properties in *Company 1 LLC* ever gets sued, It would show that all of the properties in *Company 1 LLC* have a mortgage on them and that they barely have any equity in them. Therefor my shareholder loan would not be at risk and any persona who sued would not see much meat on the bone and they would have to tangle with Insurance for anything.

My husband and I have been married 8 amazing years, and it’s so wonderful to see how close her and my husband have gotten. I’ve never pushed the “call him dad”, he read vows to her at our wedding that he’ll be there for her whenever she wants, and even in her hormonal teen years she loves watching “monster” movies with him. Before he and I were together she was slightly afraid of men, but hasn’t been that way for an incredibly long time now (most recent ex was physically abusive to me), and I just love how their relationship has grown. She recently asked me about changing her last name to hyphenate my husbands last name to her dads last name. We talked about her changing her last name altogether, but she doesn’t want to upset her dad. So instead of my maiden name hyphenated to her dads last name, it would be my husbands last name hyphenated to her dads last name. My question is since I have full legal custody do I need his permission or him to sign off that he’s ok with it? We’re in the US sorry for the context I’m on mobile",psycholpn,1,1,0.57

70,selling house acquired before marriage but forced to split profit,11vsx78,"(OH) A friend is going through a divorce (not legally separated), he lives in Ohio and her in indiana. 

They have dissolution paperwork drawn up, but she won't sign because she heard he was selling his house and wanted to have control over how much it's sold for and wants 50% of profits. He got an offer but she turned it down because she wanted more.

He bought this house 3 years before they met. She doesn't have to make any decisions about her property, but she is controlling selling his house and won't dissolve marriage until she gets what she wants from it. He was getting behind on payments and that's why he wanted to sell.

He doesn't have a lawyer. Is this typical of divorces? Is he getting screwed? If he had a lawyer, would the same situation still occur as is?

71,"I have lived in a rental house with two roommates for eight months. The city inspector just informed me the house is only zoned for two tenants, and now we are being kicked out in two weeks [MI]",11vswrn,"Title pretty much says it all. I feel like the floor has just been pulled out from under me. Yesterday, a city inspector came by for a ""routine"" inspection of the household. Upon finding out there were three people living here, he contacted the property management agency and owner of the property. We have been given two weeks to drop someone from the lease or totally move out. The property management company has offered us a different rental property at the same price (though it is much farther away from where our lives are).   


Here's the thing: all three of us were signed on the lease, and the property was marketed online as a FIVE bedroom property, for up to five tenants. This is clearly was a huge mistake on the part of the property management company and owner. Is there any legal recourse for us? It seems egregiously unfair that we should have to pay the price for someone else's failures.

72,Can an employer fire you for a fender bender had outside of work hours?,11vsve7,"Throwaway.

My spouse works for a mid-size company that spans several states. She is well-liked and successful in her career, and would be difficult for this company to replace. Her role is managerial, not sales or delivery-based, but all employee contracts seem to have been painted with the same brush. 

Her contract contains a stipulation that **the company must be included in our personal vehicle insurance as an “interested party.”** She must also report any moving violations or collisions to her boss (regardless of when/where they occur) within 24 hours, and then also submit for a drug test immediately following. **Failure to report**, later discovered by insurance claim, **is a firable offense**. The contract also states that **any two moving violations or collisions within a three year period** may also result in termination. Without any kind of comment on who the liable party is!

No driving is required on the clock for her role, although she does receive a monthly gas card allowance as part of her compensation package.

Now I thought this sounded like Big Brother Bullshit from the jump and made some stink about it in private, but she is very much a “keep your head down, work hard, don’t make waves” kind of woman who also suffers from moderate anxiety. 2.5 years ago, during her daily 1-hr commute, she caught a speeding ticket for going 4mph over the limit. This was no big deal - we went to court and had it dismissed so it wouldn’t ding our insurance - but she had a great deal of shame and anxiety about having to go to her boss and say “hey boss, I got a speeding ticket this morning.”

Sure enough, this past week she got into a minor fender bender. No damage to her vehicle, with just a little bumper ding on the vehicle she hit. Convinced that she would lose her job if she reported her second incident in three years (as I said, anxiety), she offered to settle in cash with the other driver. 

A few days have passed and the other driver has sent an invoice for the bodywork, but now my wife is beginning to panic that this will be reported to her workplace somehow, possibly by the other party filing an insurance claim anyway, and that she will be fired for failure to report and/or for exceeding her allowed violations. I have been assuring her that this will not happen, that that would be far too inconvenient for her company and also relies on a series of unlikely events occurring, but… anxiety.

I’m now just more upset than ever that this dumbass work policy is invading our home life and causing my wife so much stress. Is this even legal? Because to me it seems like a vast overreach for an employer to be allowed to give a damn about what happens with our vehicle, that we own, on our own time off the clock.",twawa89,12,0,0.44

74,Getting out of a joint tenancy agreement?,11vsuca,"I have made a terrible mistake signing a tenancy agreement (TA) and want out.


So this started with me joining my four ""friends"" to start renting together all was well until after signing the tenancy agreement and discussions of room allocation were made. For context, they did not want to discuss rooms until nearing the start date of the tenancy and after signing the TA which I foolishly agreed to. 

When we did discuss the rooms over facetime person a was agreeing to take the small room and I would take 1 of the two en-suites it was agreed on until the next day when person a said they would not want the smallest for various reasons. Person b then says I need to take the smallest because I earn the least and it just would be better. Then it became person b pressuring and cornering me into taking the smallest room and how the three already agreed to me taking the smallest room without my knowledge and then saying examples of how they are more deserving of a bigger room. Later person b then stated if I am not satisfied with this I would have to look elsewhere. 

Later they all apologised and said it was a misunderstanding and that we can agree to what rooms properly after a day or so but then on the day of the tenancy the three agreed to what rooms everyone gets behind my back and I was upset because they decided for me that I get the smallest (again) but person b and person c agreed that rent would be 475 and person a would agree; since they weren't there. 

When we all spoke again they stated they could not afford the extra payment for the rooms I stated that I could and then they stated that it's more than just the rooms and I reminded them that I was not involved in this agreement to the smallest room. The conversation eventually led to the rent having to be 525 and if I wanted it to be 500 then I would have to let the two people using the ensuite use the one bathroom because it has a bathtub meant for the two people who would not have an ensuite. 

I just want to know do I have any rights of exiting from this agreement since I feel as if I would be vulnerable living with these people since now they're essentially demanding more money for things I did not agree to and I have a feeling they will increase rent depending on how they feel. I spoke to the estate agent about exiting the TA but she said if I speak to the landlord they may agree. 

On a side note, I've already paid the deposit and one month's rent equal amounts to everyone because rooms weren't decided yet.

P.s please don't remind me of how silly I was to sign this TA without discussing this beforehand and I should have been more careful but I was so desperate to leave my current housing situation due to some serious reasons, that they were aware of.",Odd_Astronaut_7512,5,0,0.5

During her life, she told me she included me in her will, which I was greatful for her to bless me. She never told me what or how much and I never had an expectation or asked. 
The other day I received the will(s) from the lawyer.  The lawyer included an old will dated 5/2022 and the most recent will dated 11/2022. The old will stated the estate to be split evenly which would be 20% for each individual that was stated in the will. The new will favors my aunt's estranged sister who only started talking to my aunt a couple months prior till her untimely death. In the new will she receives 90% and everyone else receives 2.5%. 
Firstly why would the lawyer included the old will? Why even provide knowledge of what my deceased aunt's original wishes were? Secondly, is there a way to fight the new will or should I just accept the 2.5% and walk away? I know I might be sounding like a bitch to many, but my aunt who is inherenting the majority of the estate is manipulative and cunning. I was surprised and wondered why she suddenly was talking to her sister again after all these years.

77,Landlord trying to push for his,11vsd0r,"My landlord is really bad at adhering to his responsibilities and recently (past 2 months) I started delaying the rent payments so that he’d do at least a part of what he promised to have done and completed before I had even moved into the house (7 months ago). On the other hand, the contract I signed — the lease agreement — specifies that the rent payments are due the last day of the month each month (or that’s the way I and everyone I had consulted with interpret it at least). I well knew this the first month when I paid “upfront” but didn’t think it to be a big deal since it really didn’t matter to me to pay in the beginning or in the end of the month. Now I don’t want to continue doing that for multiple reasons. So, I told him that and that I won’t pay until the rent’s actual due date. He disagrees with my “interpretation” of the lease agreement. Last month was the first month I paid later and he annoyed me so much that I paid in the middle of the month rather than as I initially decided — in the end of the month. This month he started texting and reminding about “overdue” rent payment since the 2nd of March. He texted me on the 3rd again and then on the 17th I received a letter from him — 5 day notice to quit which states that from the date I receive it I have 5 days to quit (it’s dated for the 3rd of March). It’s now the 19th of March and I feel a bit worried but also very strange. I am rather certain that I contractually don’t violate any terms while he has been for a while — and keeps doing that. But this additional pressure on me that he tried to put with the letter is really frustrating me and I’d wanted to see if it’s possible that I am misinterpreting the contract. I’m attaching the part about the payments. Please let me know what you think and when is the monthly payment due the beginning or the end of the given month. 

“RENT AND SECURITY DEPOSIT AND PAYMENT THEREOF
3. For the initial term of this Lease, rent is set at $15,600 or one thousand three hundred ($1,300) dollars per month.
The security deposit for the Premises shall be one thousand three hundred ($1,300) dollars. Rent is payable monthly, via direct withdrawal from a bank account specified by Tenant, at the rate of one thousand three hundred ($1,300) dollars per month during the term of this agreement on the last day of each month. Tenant agrees to pay $1300 as payment of the security deposit upon execution of this agreement. Tenant agrees to pay $50 for each returned check. For each of the twelve months of the term of this Lease, payment of $1,300 shall be made via direct withdrawal from the bank account specified by Tenant, which withdrawal shall occur on the last day of each month.

LATE PENALTY
4. Time is of essence of this agreement as to payments by Tenant to Landlord. If the rent is not received before 6 PM
(EST) on the last day of each month, the rent will be considered late. A late fee of $50.00 per day shall be assessed until rent and late charges are paid in full. Any returned check will be considered as unpaid rent. A late fee of $10.00 per day shall be assessed until unpaid charges are paid in full. 

FAILURE TO PAY RENT
5. Tenant's failure to pay any installment of rent or late charge when due is default under this Lease. If Tenant does not pay any of the foregoing obligations within five (5) days after receipt of written notice to cure, Landlord may terminate this Lease and proceed to obtain possession in accordance with the law and seek damages as are appropriate under this Lease and the Virginia Residential Landlord & Tenant Act (the ""VRLTA"").”",NoTitle83,1,2,0.76

79,Need advice on how to proceed or just take my losses and move along….,11vs7vk,"My previous post was removed due to not providing enough detail so here it is!

Hired an Atty to represent me in my separation and divorce January 2019. Right from the start I said I wanted to file a separation agreement for our child and myself. I was advised there was no need to do that since we didn’t have a lot of assets. 

Fast forward, after waiting the year and a day my ex filed for divorce. Divorce was granted even though nothing had been settled or decided on in May 2020.  

Little back story, he walked out via a text message after almost 20 years, and moved in with my married “friend”. Came out and admitted 3 months later when they got engaged. They were married in June 2020.

So, I feel based on this alone there should have been an agreement to protect what there was knowing his character and how things have played out. 

The marital home was deeded in both names (state law) but I was the only one on the mortgage (neither here nor there). However, when you are married it protects the property from someone being able to place liens against it. When he filed and was granted the divorce that covering was then removed. I learned all this later which I’ll explain in a few. But still no separation agreement or ED completed. 

Fast forward to mediation for ED settlement June 2021 where my ex clearly stated he had no outstanding debt that he was aware of after being asked specifically about a certain loan/bank. Based on the information provided he was given the property that was attached to that loan that was solely in his name. He agreed that should any of this debt surface he would be responsible for it. All was settled and signed off on and I was awarded the marital home. 

Now I’m in Nov 2022 and having to refinance to completed some needed repairs on the home. We are 2 days away from closing when the closing Atty contacts me about a lien on my home for $22k which I had no idea existed since I did not owe any debt. Come to find out, it was this specific loan my ex was asked about at mediation and he said he was not aware of. 

I started my research and found out he was initially served at his residence in Nov 2019 to appear in court for the debt hearing. His now wife signed for it delivered by the Sheriff. So he lied about the debt and knowledge of it prior to signing the ED agreement. 

So, I had to pay off the debt in order to get the refi completed and I had no choice since it was work that had to be done! My Atty said my only recourse was to file a contempt of court to our agreement since he lied and we have proof of that. 

The end result in court was I was SOL solely because there was no time limit stipulated in the agreement for him having to pay the debt. The judge did not agree that he was in contempt due to this loophole. 

Questions are:
1. Do I have a case against my Atty for: a. Not filing a separation agreement
b. Not advising me to verify there were no liens on the property prior to ED
c. Negligently not adding in a time frame for debt to paid.

I feel these were a snowball effect that lead to me loosing the $20k. Especially since there is NO time frame for my ex to pay me the debt so I will never see it.",freedom1192019,0,2,0.76

82,Attorney Misconduct - Ghosted and Scammed by Attorneys in CA,11vs3g2,"Boyfriends Father died, with a will naming my boyfriend as his heir. Father was legally separated from his wife for 13 yrs at the time of death. Lived 9hrs from her. The legal separation reads very much like a divorce in that they have no legal rights to each others properties, debts, estates, wills, etc... it named 5 assets that she would get upon his death and that was it. Upon death she immediately began acting as the executor with no legal authority. She took over his accounts, his funerary arrangements, got into his email accounts, attempted to collect his mail from the post office & showed up at his home demanding his belongings claiming she was his legal wife and threatening legal action against anyone who contested that. She was calling my boyfriend asking him to produce belongings that were his fathers, stating they were hers... We consulted with an attorney at a large firm who was excited to handle the probate and litigation for civil, fraud and possible criminal charges against her. 

We sent the signed contract and retainer funds 10/2021. We heard nothing, i called several times and discovered the attorney we initially consulted with had left the company. They eventually assigned the case to another attorney in the office. It took 6 months for him to get the probate filed, no idea why. After they filed the probate, they unexpectedly referred us to another attorney at another company to handle the ""exploratory probate"" (since she took over and we were unaware of what assets were there, we only knew of a few) & any litigation, stating they didnt do that there. Apparently the attorney we originally consulted with did, but he was now gone. I wouldn't have signed/sent the retainer tp them had I known this had changed. 

We retained attorney # 2 in April 2022 to do an exploratory probate & look into possible civil/criminal suits. He told us several things he was going to look into regarding the probate - check case law on the funerary rights, look into a deed, subpoena all records from the legally separated wife who had taken over all accounts & estate matters illegally, possinly file fraud charges, etc... we had 6 months to turn it all into the probate court. 

He never did any of it, he kept putting us off, telling us how busy & overwhelmed he was, we offered to seek another attorney and he said no and pormised he would start to work on our case - this went on for months. I kept having to send him the same email at his request explaining the situations multiple times as he would never read it or respond, he eventually checked into 1 investment account we mentioned, out of the several things he was supposed to look into, the week of our court date when the asset info was due back to the courts, but it required further research/a handwriting expert as the document appears to have been forged.... he told us he looked into that one 1st because it was the most money and we could use that to pay for the rest (i realize now he was looking for a quick payout). When the deadline for the discovery of assets was upon us in September 2022, I sent a panicked email to him, to which he explained he would simply get an extension so he could conduct his research. He didnt do that, he missed the court date altogether!

On our last conversation 10/2022 he asked me to send the email with the possible case info & questions we had 1 last time, promised he would read and respond to the questions we had on each possible suit, and asked me to confirm I wanted him to proceed with the handwriting expert on the investment account. I sent him an email confirming to proceed in mid October 2022 and since then we have NEVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN. I sent 3 follow up emails over the next several months, copied to his paralegal each time. No response. We did receive a bill where he had several charges for consults with the original probate attorneys office over the months but i was unsure what he would need to consult with them about since he had all the same info they did and hadnt followed up on anything yet. 

In January 2022 we received a letter from the courts to appear and possibly face fines for not producing asset info on the probate back in Sept. Since attorney # 2 hadnt responded to me since Oct 2022, i panicked and reached out to the 1st probate attorney who referred us to him in Feb 2023. At this point, I thought something terrible may have happened to attorney # 2 since he wasnt responding. Attorney #1 reached out to Attorney #2 and #2 tells #1 that he was done with our case and he never found anything! I was blown away that he had not communicated this to us at any point simce our last conversation, I was shocked that he was alive but refused to respond to us at all, and that he had lied to Attorney #1 stating he didn't find anything - when he never did any of the work he promised aside from reaching out on the 1 investment account just the week before the Sept due date. Attorney #1 asked for a bulleted list of all the things #2 promised to look into but didn't so they could discuss. I sent that to him. I also told Attorney #1 that we no longer wanted to proceed with Attorney #2 due to his complete an utter lack of professionalism.

Attorney # 1 appeared at the new court date in Feb 2023. Prior he asked us not to say anything to the judge about why we had no info yet, unless the judge specifically asked my boyfriend. Instead he would just tell him they hadnt found anything but were still researching - i realized this was a nice way to cover their asses so they didnt get fined. Attorney #2 was also supposed to appear at this court date, but he did not. He instead reached out to attorney # 1 and asked for an update on how it went. The court granted an extension. 

Attorney #1 never gave us exact reasons for why Attorney #2 never handled our case or did the things he promised. He didn't seem bothered by the fact that the Attorney he had personally referred us to had not done anything and we still had no answers & no assets to report nearly a year after retaining Attorney #2. He told us attorney # 2 typically does good work for them. He simply told us we will have to find another attorney to handle the exploratory probate. Meanwhile we have just wasted money and time and with no empathy from him.

We have since received another billing from Attorney # 2, now billing us for the conversations he recently had with Attorney #1 where he said he was done with our case, after not responding to our repeated contact attempts since October 2022, i found the audacity almost comical! Attorney #1 should not havr had to track him down for us in the 1st place! 

Now we just received our 1st and only bill from Attorney #1 for over $17,000! Since our case was handed over to #2 we didnt know we had a bill in excess of the initial retainer because their contract says they will bill periodically, most likely monthly and never have since we ratined 10/2021, and because i requested a billing from them via email in Sept 2022 and never received any response or bill. I was beyond outraged to discover that they too were charging us for multiple consults with Attorney # 2 thru the year.  

At this point the court is expecting info on assets in the next few months. We no longer have an attorney to explore that for us. We are so lost and after being screwed by the ex, we got screwed by 2 different attorneys who could care less. We feel like we got sscammed. We have no more answers on what assets are there and what criminal and civil suits we can pursue than we dod when we started this process in 10/2021. We feel like we need an attorney to go after these attorneys. This just doesn't seem right. I was told to write the CA Bar. I tried to call and understand what that process entails or whether we should pay these bills in the meantime, but they don't give advice over the phone & told me to write in. Which I will, but how utterly exhausting, overwhelming and defeating this has all been.

85,Security Deposit from renting,11vrvg9,"So I lived in an apartment for a little over 4 years with 0 issues on either end. No late or missed rent and no issues with landlord or neighbors. Signed a year long lease agreement each year. Recently, I made the choice to move out of the apartment and in with my fiance. So I spoke to the landlord and asked what I needed to do as I was breaking the lease early. She said I only needed a 30 written notice and would have to pay rent until someone else rented it. I moved out in January of this year, my lease ended in June. 

I moved out, had it cleaned all the normal things. I paid February rent and knew they were renovating the apartment so I'd planned on paying March rent as well. I emailed the landlord towards the end of February and asked how it was going with the renovations and if anyone had been on the list to rent it. To which I got back ""it's been rented. Thanks for checking."" So I almost paid a months rent since she never let me know it was rented. 

I just received a letter in the mail for the move out costs, which I owe $373 for according to her. This is where I'm looking for advice. My security deposit was $815 and when she said about breaking the lease ""you forfeit your security deposit."" I said ""I understand I get nothing back if there's any left over after paying for the repair costs."" And she agreed. So my security deposit obviously covered the costs and they still profit the difference. I emailed her again asking why I owe when the security deposit covered the costs. She simply said because I forfeited it when I moved out. So I looked at my lease agreement, which states nothing of forfeiting the deposit. It only states it's used for damages, paying rent or utilities in case of the tenant moving out or abandonment.

As far as down payments are concerned, he's taking the financial risk & I've just got the mental anguish of not having large amounts of money to contribute.  We both have good credit scores, neither of us have any debts, or anything that would impact loans.

We've done the math & know what we can afford, we're also trying to keep this fair arrangement wise - he pays the down payment, I pay greater % of monthly mortgage payments & we each own our % of the house should something go sideways. 

What we're stuck on is understanding how to accomplish 'unequal ownership' with a changing ownership percentage?

Do we go with a co-borrowing agreement and get both our names on the mortgage?

88,My coworkers and I need help against an abusive owner,11vrt59,"Hi everyone, I hope this is the right place to ask this and if it's not please let me know I'll remove the post right away :).  A couple months ago, the owner of the store I work in (in California) came in especially angry at us. Triggered by the fact we hadn't put a ""sold out"" sign on a coin machine, he continued to scream at us about how he would ""never use a trans person's preferred pronouns because that's stupid and made up"" in front of all the customers. How a sold out coin machine can lead to that I can't really tell you, he'll use any reason to yell at us. Someone reported him to HR but given he pays HR all they did was made us sign something saying they held a harassment meeting. 

This isn't the first time he's come in like this. There are several accounts of him harassing my coworkers, he's even taken it to the point of calling them ""r*t*rds"" and making them cry. Luckily I'm still new enough that he doesn't acknowledge me when he comes, regardless of that I hate seeing my coworkers be treated like that. 

If we were to record him coming in and saying all these things, would we be able to use it to report him for workplace violence? Would that fall under OSHA guidelines? I would honestly appreciate any information on how to fight this given I'm not very familiar with labor laws yet. 

tldr: In California, can I record my boss's abusive behavior and use it to report him? If not, how can we defend ourselves against him?",alflx,3,0,0.5

90,"Bad Roommate Abandons Her Property, Refuses To Pay Rent",11vrns3,"tl;dr bad roommate left her stuff with us for over a month while she plans to move out, refuses to pay a storage fee for us keeping her stuff here. I plan to move all of her things to a storage unit and tell her she can have it back when she pays her share of the bills. Am I legally in the right here?

Hey all. This is a pretty long story that has been going on for over a month now but I will try to summarize everything as quickly and efficiently as possible. I currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment with my girlfriend and one other girl. In early February this year, me and my girlfriend had a relatively big falling out with the roommate. We learned that she had been saying some untrue and disgusting things about us behind our backs to our friends and coworkers. When we confronted our roommate about this, she essentially ran away. It's been over a month since she's been back to the apartment. All of her stuff is still here. We never agreed to store any of it for her. (Also, this is probably important, she's not actually even on the lease). We decided we wouldn't ask her to pay for utilities as she hasn't been here, but since we are essentially storing her stuff, we are asking her for rent. Yesterday when we asked her for her portion of the rent (just a couple hundred dollars), she flat out refused. We told her that her that her stuff is still here so she needs to pay us a storing fee but she refused that as well. I read online that in my state, after 30 days any abandoned property belongs to whoever it is abandoned with or finds it next. So my plan for today is to pack up everything that she left in our apartment and put it in a storage unit. After that I will tell her that her stuff is gone and unless she decided to pay for her portion of the rent, we will be selling the stuff to cover her share. My question is, am I legally in the right here? Does she have any recourse in case she decides to call the cops and claim we ""stole"" her things?",FireBreathingSloth,0,1,0.67

St Patrick day celebrations are in full swing. Last night I was picking up my wife and her friends from the club (I don’t like crowds of drunk people so i elected to stay home.) My wife and friends was (obviously) drunk and playing loud party music in my car. I didn’t really care about that tbh. Some girls idk came over and began twerking on the front of my car. That’s fine I guess, I’m not going to run them over for twerking. One of the girls, then decides to CLIMB on top of my hood, puts her hands on my windshield and then starts shaking her ass. Again, I don’t know these women. First I yell at her to get off and she doesn’t listen. Then I used the windshield wipers to hit her hands off and make her get off. In response she just starts lifting her hands over the windshield wipers as they go. This is moment the question stems from.

I put my car in reverse and back up 3-4ft and stop hard. It doesn’t faze her at all. She’s still going. I do it again. She then decides it’s time to get down but as she’s getting down she slips off and knocks her head on the ground.

92,Upstairs Neighbour Keeps Taking Down Wyze Camera,11vp998,"Hi everyone,

I am a young adult female living in a basement suite and have been since November of last year. I installed a Wyze camera at the front of the house facing the street for the security of my car and packages.

The upstairs unit is now being rented by an older male who took the camera down upon moving in. When I asked for the camera back, he requested that I do not put it on the front of the house. I thought this was reasonable and asked if I could put it on the side of the house (where my door is) as a compromise, to which he agreed and even watched me reposition it. 

The next day, I received a text from the property manager mentioning that the upstairs tenant complained the camera was too close to the front of the house, despite him agreeing the day before. The text also said that it should not point at the door, which it did not. 

I sent both the upstairs tenant and the property owner a picture of what the camera sees, showing them that the camera did not capture the door or the front walkway. I did not receive a response. I have asked others for their advice and they have agreed that I reasonably accommodated his privacy concerns.

However, it has now become an issue where the upstairs tenant keeps unplugging or pulling the camera off of the Velcro strip I used to attach it to the house (since I am renting).

He seems to strongly believe that I will use the camera to spy on him, something I have zero intention of doing. I am beginning to wonder if the people that often come over in the early hours of the morning (I can hear their very loud footsteps and voices through the ceiling) are part of this reasoning, as that is when the camera is typically dismantled. 

I am getting increasingly concerned about the level of privacy that he is insistent on maintaining, especially since it is to the detriment of my safety. On one occasion, I believe he waited outside in an effort to try and confront me after I had replaced the camera, which was extremely unsettling. 

It is getting to the point that I am considering breaking the lease. Ideally, I do not want it to come to that, but the number of available options seems to be rapidly declining. I have ordered a more permanent camera mount that will screw into the siding (RIP damage deposit), but I do not know how long that will last.

For context, I am in central Alberta.",anticamera_neighbour,1,1,0.67
93,Indiana Child Support and other family law questions,11vrk47,"Ok so I’ve reviewed the rules and the wiki so I hope I’m on the right track here but I have some questions about some family law issues that I’m looking to resolve.

For some background info, I am a 36 year old male in Indiana. My ex wife and I divorced about 3 years ago and we have 3 boys together, aged 10, 8, and 6. As part of the divorce, she received joint legal custody of all three boys while I was ordered to pay child support to the tune of ~$1500/month.

When we divorced, she moved with the boys to another city about 4 hrs away to be closer to her family. I get to have my boys every other weekend and for roughly 9-10 full weeks out of the year, as well as alternating holidays. It equals out to her having the boys about 70% of the time and me having them about 30%. We have a pretty solid coparenting relationship but I want more time with my boys while paying less in child support.

I plan on moving with my current wife to the city my ex lives in this summer so wet can accomplish that. Which brings me to my question(s):

1. Once upon a time I had heard that I would only be eligible for joint legal custody if I lived in the same school district as my children. I don’t know if this remains or was ever true but I can’t find any hard answers on this.

2. The way I understand it, I have to have joint legal custody to be able to eliminate child support if you support/have your children 50% of the time. Is this also true or am I going about this the hard way?

Basically I want to be able to have some freedom with where I live while also paying less or eliminating child support and having the boys considerably more than I already do (at least 50% of the time, if not more).

I am quite sure that **in the most serious cases** (murder, mass shootings...), the police already knows it or they are investigating it.

I would like to know if those videos and images are illegal. I have some quesions:

1. Do I need to report images or videos of physical violence (fights, accidents, mass-shooting and murder) to the police?
2. Is it illegal to watch those videos and images of fights, accidents, mass-shooting and murder?
3. Is it illegal to download them?

What happened was, I was 14. I was on a dating site when I shouldn’t have been, but I was there. I didn’t lie about my age, any guy I talked to I said I was 14. 

I started talking to this guy, he was 21 at the time. He’s an international student from bangladesh. He says “We can just be friends.” But that changed from friends to… “we can date but no sex.” To…
“You can’t tell anyone what we did.” 
I thought I was cool, I had a mature boyfriend. He had his own house, a car, lots of money… I thought it was okay. 

Then on his birthday, he bought us a big bottle of alcohol. I was still 14. He gave me the bottle and I started chugging, I didn’t know what to do or how to drink, I never had before. After that he put on some music and I passed out. When I woke up, I was naked… on the floor of his dorm, crying in a puddle of my own piss and vomit. I have no idea what happened that night, all I remember was being scared and confused and him telling me to be quiet.

The relationship continued for a year. Most of the sex was consensual, though i wasn’t legal enough to consent I am aware it is still illegal. There was a time when we had a fight and I started crying and he tried to make advances on me. I told him to stop he wouldn’t, he raped me for 10 minutes while I cried until it finally killed his mood and he stopped.


My mom eventually found out about the relationship and took me straight to the police. I gave my statement and they asked if I wanted to press charges. At the time, I said no. 

They spoke with him but that was it. “He claimed he had no idea how old I was” bull shit. “That he didn’t know it was wrong” bull shit. 

At the time I thought it would be scary, to go to court and go through all this. That it would be easier to put it behind me and forget about it.

113,[UPDATE] My neighbor’s dog is aggressive and has attacked my roommate’s dog three times now. What can we do?,11vq677,"Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/11tpbik/neighbors_dog_is_aggressive_and_has_attacked_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

After I reached out to property management, they contacted the neighbor and requested that the dog be removed from the premises immediately. Apparently mine is not the first report they’ve gotten. The neighbor sent me about 20 text messages about how his dog gets along great with other dogs, he’s spent so much money on her medical care, I was ruining his life, he fought for my country (he is a navy vet) and he didn’t appreciate me repaying him this way, now she has to be on the street because of me. He basically tried to guilt me into thinking this was all somehow my fault. I told him if he had an issue with the decision to have her removed that he needs to take it up with management and that I would not be discussing the issue further. I’ll continue to follow up with management in the coming days regarding the dog’s removal.

Hopefully he will either leave the property himself to stay with the dog or the dog will be re-homed to a more responsible and loving owner.

115,Minefield of poo and cigarettes,11vpyff,"I am in Clackamas county, Oregon. The apartment community I live in has beautiful grounds and landscaping, with large grassy areas all around. They allow pets and have multiple dog stations with trash cans and poo bags. These stations are maintained (trash emptied and bags restocked) regularly, however some residents do not use these as they are required to do. They break the rules and they don't care, because they have no consequences. 

Complaints to the old manager went unheard. I'd call to let him know there was a big pile of poo near my front door, he would say ""I'll have the maintenance guy clean it up today"". After a few days calling and getting the same answer, I ended up picking up and throwing the poo away myself. 

Earlier this month, we received notice that the community has a new manager. When I first went to the office to explain the issue, she really acted like she cared, she even mentioned a small pile of poo in the flowerbed just by the leasing office that was bothering her. I told her some apartments do DNA testing or neighbor snitching programs, she seemed to think those were great suggestions. But nothing happened, and the poo piles were never picked up!

The second time I went to complain to her, she was too busy to pay attention, she just said, ""I'll have the maintenance guy clean it up tomorrow"". It's now been over a week since then, and these piles of poo have been sitting for even weeks longer, and the piles are only accumulating. My community is a MINEFIELD OF POO!

I am a dog owner and I pick up after my dog's poo, because that's what a responsible dog owner does. It's become more and more stressful to walk my dog in the community, because any time you step off a sidewalk here, you're at risk, ESPECIALLY when it's dark, as many lamp light posts in the community do not have working light bulbs and you can't see where you step.

I should also note that it's not JUST dog poo but cat poo as well, sometimes half buried. Lots of residents allow their cats to roam around and do as they please, without ever cleaning up the poo.

I've now emailed the property management company, which owns about 25 communities. I asked them to enforce the lease agreement and begin issuing fines to residents, since they could be making a lot of money off this. I just want to poo picked up. Is there anything else I can do? I feel like the manager is being negligent at this point. I haven't received a response to my email yet, and I doubt I will anytime soon.

We are a non-smoking community and I also notice cigarette butts from time to time, but this morning I saw 5 in a small area of grass while on my morning walk. Another thing I have to look out for while walking in the minefield. Is there anything else I can do? Who can I hold accountable for this?

Things have gotten worse and I had to file a police report for extortion today under penal code 518 pc for him threatening to divulge information to my job to get me fired if I do not meet his demands of getting an abortion or signing an NDA and letting him sign away his rights (it qualifies as extortion as threatening to expose a secret). His mother works at a law office and I guess is unaware of the situation.

He no longer says he will take the baby to Mexico and instead says he will have the baby put in cps as he has no interest in raising it. Thanks to the responders of my last post, I feel like this is far from possible but still causes me stress.

My question is do I need to hire a lawyer? The police officer said this will probably go to court as it is a felony. As the petitioner, can the court appoint me one? I make a decent living but I live in a very high income area and retainers for lawyers are about 10k, which I do not have. 

I am also wondering if it is a conflict of interest to contact his parents? I want to let them know the situation as they are unaware that they will be having a grandchild and could possibly talk some sense into him as he keeps incriminating himself.

117,Am I entitled to pay while on call?,11vprkh,"I work for a large specialty veterinary hospital in Illinois as a veterinary technician. Surgery, internal medicine, and neurology technicians are required to be on call for anesthetic procedures. In my department specifically we are on call one work day per week and alternating weekends and holidays (usually 1-2 full weekends per month).

If we get a call to come in (no matter the time) we are to be at work within an hour. We are not able to drink alcohol obviously and we can't travel more than an hour's distance from work while on call. Procedures we get called in for can vary greatly on length and complexity, but average time spent at work once called in is probably 4-5 hours. They are now trying to add another service that can take up to 12 hours after being called in and employees are giving a lot of push back. 

Sometimes you will get called in for 3 calls in a night. Sometimes you won't get called in for weeks. It's very variable. All of these procedures are some sort of emergency or ""urgent"" otherwise they would wait until normal business hours.


We get an on call bonus of $125-150 (depending on department/specialty) for each ""call"" plus our hourly wage. We are not compensated for the time spent on call when we arent called in. 

I have been searching everywhere to see if we have any legal grounds to ask for pay while on call (not just when called in), but it is hard for me to find any black and white rules online for my state. Most resources I've found have said something like ""if it prevents you from having your normal life you should be compensated"" I feel it does prevent that. I commonly have to leave my children's activities, have to stay super close to home as I already live 50 min away, etc. However I don't know if legally it would be seen that way.

I first noticed fraudulent activity in my banking account 2 weeks ago which has led to me finding out that the identity thieves also applied for several credit cards under my name as well. I quickly realized that I became a victim of identity theft so I went through all the steps recommended to help protect myself including signing up for an identity protection service, calling all the financial institutions to disclose the fraudulent activity, freezing all my credit bureaus, and filing a police report (which I have still not heard from yet since filing 2 weeks ago). Texas DPS just sent me a letter in the mail admitting their mistake and upon further research they were aware of this situation since late 2022.

122,Bought a car for $2k. I'm having to pay $8K now...I'll take any advice,11vpcz7,"This will be my first post and I'm not sure how to structure this, so I'm keeping it short while still providing information. Let me know if there are any questions.

I'm a 22 year old female in my last semester of college. This is in America in the state of New Mexico. This happened in August, 2022. Bought a car from someone who told me their car was in decent shape and does not have any major problems, other than the spark plugs and a door not being able to open from one side. I bought the 2003 car for $2k, and was driving the car to get the car registered and insured.  Turns out that, in addition to the issues beforehand, the brakes also didn't work. Found that out when I crashed into the back of a officer's car (a regular vehicle, not a cop car) while they were going to get their sick kid from school. I felt terrible when I learned this.

Thankfully, no one was injured. The driver's car had their bumper detached and some dents, and my car's trunk was nearly folded in half with some radiator fluid leaking out of the bottom of the car. I profusely started apologizing and practically begging for mercy. I told them why I was driving and where I was going, that I'm uninsured but I'll pay them for the damages or repay them through labor, and provided all my contact information. The officer was extremely calm and understanding, and I was told that I'll only need to pay $500 for the insurance. We contacted each other the same day to confirm contact info, and I was updated that I would actually pay $250 and provided proof. I paid that in full. I thought I was in the clear.

I was not, in fact, in the clear.

Got a call in late February from the insurance company that I would need to pay about $8k or a $6k settlement. The settlement offer is open until the end of this month, and will only go up in price. I was also given payment options, and told that I could have my driver's license suspended until I pay in full (I'm honestly fine with never driving again. I get flashbacks every time someone driving me around brakes a little too close to another car). Even when I said that I had already reimbursed the insured, they told me that this is not how insurance works and that I was only paying the beginning part of the bill. I was also told that the insurance does not always tell their clients what their processes are, which I found weird. I don't have that sort of money because I'm a broke college student, so I'm looking to see if there is any advice on how to move forward. Is there any way to either lower the amount I need to pay, or get enough funds in such a short amount of time? Also, does anyone understand how insurance works on both ends?

The property has been used a shortcut to the corner store for generations. I am attempting to do a native habitat restoration but I want to leave the walking path that has been made so that people can continue using it as a shortcut.

But I also want to post signs telling people what's going on and to not trample the environment. However, I'm concerned that by acknowledging trespassers I am giving implicit consent and will therefore be liable for any possible injuries they sustain while trespassing.

125,Is this blackmail?,11vp748,"I have a friend, “Anna” (26F), who has a daughter, “Eva” (4). 
Long story short, Anna and I (23F) met when she was 7mo pregnant with Eva. At the time, Anna was getting out of an abusive relationship with Eva’s biological father. 
A little after Eva was born, she was removed and placed with Anna’s father (“Brian”) and stepmother for three months. Brian reported her to CPS, citing that she was “unstable” following the abusive relationship. She was certainly dealing with some symptoms of PTSD, however, she had a support system and Eva was thriving. 
Essentially, Anna had to take some parenting classes and one on avoiding the cycle of DV, then Eva came home, and CPS was no longer involved. 
However, every time that Anna goes out (i.e. St. Patrick’s Day this weekend) or dates someone new, Brian continuously threatens to get CPS involved and “take Eva back”. It’s important to note, if Anna goes out, Eva is in a safe place, usually at home with another close family member.
These threats usually take place when Brian is picking Eva up for weekend visits, which make Anna feel like there’s a veiled threat that he won’t give her back on the designated pickup day. Anytime Anna tries to skip a weekend visit, CPS is immediately brought up. Would this be considered blackmail and could any action be taken against the continuous threats?",DeerSad,1,1,0.67

127,Loud Neighbor playing music till 4-5 am,11voryp,"Sorry for the long post. 

Me n my wife bought our first house in a townhome community (where we share both walls with neighbors). Since we bought it we are facing one issue after another :(. Anyway, one of our neighbors is great and friendly guy and the other neighbor is a middle aged single guy who we share our living room wall and 2 bedrooms walls with and he parties until early morning almost every weekend. 

We used to party when we were young and moved to suburbs when we got married hoping for a quite life so we didn't say nothing for almost 6-9 months but it got to a point where it was unbearable like EDM music going till 4 am and starting back up at 7 am so I finally went over and politely asked him to lower the music, he said no problem and did reduce it from ""knocking pictures of a wall"" to ""oontz oontz "" level. We tried to adjust to it as well but couldn't. 

After a month I went over and asked him to please lower the music as our entire house is still vibrating and we are unable sleep or even watch TV. His response was he already reduced enough and now feels like he is being restricted in his own home and said something about how dare I disturb him at his house at night and he slammed the door. 

It felt bad, I was polite and always stood at the bottom of the steps like more than 6 feet away from the door so he didn't feel like I'm in his face and respectfully asked him but yet he was arrogant and slammed the door. I didn't know what else to do, so we thought we will just inform HOA next time instead of talking to him directly. 

Since then he lowered his EDM music little more but still enough to make ""dun"" ""dun dun"" sound like ORC drums from LOTR which still vibrated our furniture a bit and could feel it even in our couch but as it was less often than before we didn't know if we wanna push our luck so didn't say nothing for 3 months, where he partied less and even if he did he only did till 10 pm (we still couldn't concentrate on TV with that background reverb till 10pm but adjusted). Now after 3 months he is partying again until 4 am and we are unable to sleep not sure what to do. 

Should we report to HOA? OR Should we write him a letter explaining our side and hoping he will understand? If so what to even write in that letter? I can thank him for lowering the music but we are still feeling a lot of reverb n vibrations in our house and we work most days and need restful sleep like anyone to function so can he please understand how his enjoyment is causing us to suffer? Maybe he thinks he lowered his volume but that might not be low enough to not bother neighbors as his setup of huge speakers, amp, sub might not be a best place in a residential community where we share walls?

Me n my wife don't want any conflict and didn't want to escalate, just want to resolve peacefully that's why we never called cops(there were many instances we could have). We really can't take this anymore after 1.5 years, so whatever you guys suggest is the best solution I will gladly take it except for moving as we can't afford to move from our first house yet.

* cross posted * we are in CA! 

Back in 2018 someone opened a credit card with my husbands name. 2020 was when we noticed because we trying to apply for a new car. We’re still fighting this case! 

Fast forward today, as we’re sitting at home, someone banged on our door & served my husband papers!

He’s being sued by Midland Credit Company. 

We read the full pack & it looks like someone opened a credit card to VS/PINK! A statement was provided but does not say when the account was open! Statement shows it was being sent to our old address where we used to live at my parents duplex & a payment made on May 2020 and Nov 2020! Address still being that old address! What’s bizarre is that this person made payments to this account.

We moved out of there July 2019 and my parents moved out of there March 2020! 

We never knew about this! We’re not credit card ppl. We barely check our credit!! We don’t have any credit cards. The only loan we have is our car! Which is almost paid off. 

Rewind: when we lived at the duplex with my parents. We had a neighbor that we shared address and mailbox with and during that time someone opened a credit card with my husbands name, we felt like it was his gf at the time! We filed a police report nothing was done! Then we thought it was my MIL because some transactions were near her area of living and out of nowhere my MIL started treating my husband and I very weird and almost defensive everytime we would see her & we never verbally said we thought it was her to her face but also our neighbor and his gf at the time did go towards that way sometimes! 

Anyways! We’re being sued by Midland Credit Company. The amount is for $1400. 

What should we do?! We have 30 days!! 

RN, we’re going thought a lot tremendously. I was just diagnosed with lupus and mentally have not been good and had to cut down my working days which now my husband is doing the best he can to help me, himself, and our 2 kids. COVID definitely hit us hard bc my husband is a barber, he’s finally rebuilding his business back up. I don’t want us to pay for something we didn’t do! 

How can we prove this?! They used our old address. The billing statement attached to this court docket is definitely not the full bank statements but the ones they sent us is from when we didn’t live at that address. I’m the court docket they stated they contacted us via phone and mail multiple times. We have never received anything! This is the first we’re ever hearing this!",Little_Detail2970,1,1,0.6

We became fast friends, and it didn't take a while we started to have sexual talks, at the time, I thought it was normal but I started to feel sick with this and often would leave him for periods of times because I felt disgusted 

We stoped doing this because Istopped it, but of course, he felt sad about it
During these three years of friendship he would make sexual jokes towards me and stuff like that, I would tell him I felt uncomfortable and he would still do it sometimes.
He also mentioned he dated a girl from his city who was 13 a few years before meeting me and he was over 18.

He always bought me gifts for free but last year he started telling me he'd buy them in exchange of nudes, I never gave it to him until this year, while I am now 16 and he is 26

Often he gets drunk and starts telling me he's going to kill himself, that people leave him, and that he loves me, I feel absolutely terrible and I don't know what to do.

The last time I snapped and sent him more pictures than he asked because I had a mental breakdown, he promised he'd buy more stuff, but today, he asked why I had those pictures, to who i was going to send it to, and I said it was none of his business.

He started saying how he with he was my boyfriend and overall, it made me feel bad, again.

He has one of my family members address, my phone number, my full name and one of my family members CPF... And nudes.

132,This is tricky.,11voj4j,"So my grandmother had a home inspector come to her house. The home inspection wasn’t on her behalf, when her husband died he left a will that when he passed she could stay in the house he owned and his land until she passed also. Well, the daughters and sons of said husband hired a home inspector to come to the house and check everything out on it. 

I’m curious who’s responsible for the house report if there’s anything serious or hazardous. Should she be notified if there’s anything hazardous regardless? Considering this isn’t exactly a buyer and seller transactional thing I’m a little confused on it. 

Also, the home inspector almost caused a fire? I’ll attach a picture but basically he left a heater on and messed with a bunch in the house. My grandma didn’t exactly follow him around or anything and didn’t know what he did/fully inspected I believe. He melted a trashcan the heater was next too and she didn’t know until she smelled it.

134,I have reason to suspect a debt collection law firm may be stealing money from me through excessive use of wage garnishment. (US - WI),11voeey,"First, let me say that I am way too relaxed when it comes to legal stuff. I knew I had a debt that I couldn't possibly pay because I don't make enough to pay it, and I knew whatever was going to happen was going to happen whether I interfered or not, so for the most part, I've ignored most legal paperwork filed against me. I know, it's unwise, and ill swallow that ineptitude on my part. Moving on...

A couple of months ago, I received a notice from a debt collector that the debt was being transferred to a law firm for garnishment on my paycheck. At the time, I knew I had debts, but I had no idea which debt it was that was being transferred. If it was a debt I actually owed, then so be it, I just wanted to know the source of the debt to verify that it was a debt I was aware of. So I reached out to the company mentioned in the paperwork I received in the mail...at least, I tried to reach out to them. Any time I would call, all I would get is voicemail. Every voicemail left went unanswered. The company's website was VERY shady in that nothing seemed to lead back to someone who would actually respond to me, and I had to actually do some digging to find the address of this law firm. Which, when I tried to visit in person, I couldn't access it unless I was an employee. So my paycheck was garnished for several months by a law firm that I could never get a hold of for a debt that I had no idea where it was from. 

That garnishment ended last month and this month I received a new notice of garnishment started by that same law firm. Looking at how my paycheck documented it, my paycheck itemized it as Garnishment A with an identifying number that has ended. Garnishment B with an identifying number is starting up. And those ID numbers listed are the same number. I could be mistaken, but if those numbers are the same, it seems as if this company realized it got away with garnishing me once, and now it's just repeating the process and doing it again on the same debt. Like they plan to keep on milking garnishments out of me until I notice.

After my attempts to get a hold of ANYONE at that law firm have failed and looked up the company on the BBB website tells me the law firm has an F rating, I'm really questioning whether this law firm is real or is it just a scam company using a legal process to steal money from me.

If you want to go after these guys on my behalf, go ahead. charge them whatever you'd like as your fee to get my money back if it is a scam. I just want this to stop.

135,A few basic questions regarding LLC's tax status and real estate licensing,11voa10,"1) What Conditions enable AND/OR require an LLC to change its filing status (multi/partner/disregarded) for federal and state of California Tax purposes.  How often must it do so?

2 ) Under what conditions does a ""single member LLC"", lose its liability protections?  aka is the best of both worlds possible with liability vs control or do the two go hand in hand? As in; Can you only get liability protection with filing separate, meetings, minutes, independent attorney and accountant, etc?

3) Can an LLC represent itself for Real Estate? like how a manager can't represent a corporation??  It appears the real estsaste law says no, but there are some exemptions and I was wondering how hard it is to qualify for that as an individual with 8 properties and my wife the only other member of the LLC.

4) I was reading that an owner, or partner of, an LLC has to hire a real estate broker to manage rental properties.  Is that right?  Whats the simplest solituon to that that keeps liability at bay? Is there a way around that? 

5) What would happen to lease or property if a tenant found out a real estate license is void or the owner never had one but the owner of record was a corp or LLC?",1pnp_hippy,1,2,0.76
136,Employer Refusing To Engage in Interactive Process,11vo598,"I have a medical condition and I've been having trouble performing my job duties. My managers didn't want to help me. I looked up my employer's policy and they had a point of contact to request reasonable accommodation. 

I request the accommodation and they gave me a form for my physician. I complete that and returned it. One human resource person denied it because it wasn't specific and the another human resource person denied it for being too specific. Denied the same request for two totally different reasons. They both determined that it was unreasonable.  

A few months later, I made another(same) request and it was denied again because it was unreasonable but for another reason this time. This time it was because I KNOW how to do my job. She said having trouble performing my job doesn't matter but since I know how to do my job it is unreasonable. I asked her to provided an example of what she think is reasonable and she said ""she couldn't answer that for me"". 

 I am not understanding the process correctly, am I missing something here? It has become like a guessing game of what they consider reasonable. 

The interactive process is a two way street. We are suppose to be brainstorming and coming up with ideas. If they don't share to me what is reasonable how must the interactive process be completed if they are not willing to share information with me.

Is that just their way of nicely saying it’s not worth their time? I’ve easily inquired with over 15 firms and got no response on like 6 of them, a few said it’s not an area of law they practice, and the remaining said they were too busy to take new cases. All in all I got scammed out of over 10% of the cars value and have a lot in writing of them admitting to it so I wouldn’t think it would be necessarily a hard case to prove for an attorney, but I don’t know shit about this stuff so I don’t really know what to do. 

Do I just have to deal with it and accept that this kind of robbery in broad daylight is just accepted in our society? I get that for a law firm, 4000 dollars isn’t necessarily a big payday for them but surely there’s some way I can hold this dealer accountable for this and “maybe” recover some of the money they scammed me on? Last I checked it’s illegal to sell cars this way, but yet it seems like there’s no way to hold them accountable so what’s the point of it even being illegal?

Anyway. They ended up towing my car and taking me to the station to do finger prints and such. But the thing I’m confused about is, aren’t they supposed to read you your Miranda rights when you get arrested? Yk, “you have the right to remain silent, yada yada yad”? Because they didn’t?

145,Illegal EMS worker pay?,11vnjhd,"I work for an ambulance service in Arkansas and believe that some of our employees are not being paid appropriately. Minimum wage in our state is $11/hour and I’m not sure we are lawfully paid for overtime. Can someone help me research and understand the labor laws regarding this? 

We are EMS workers and our pay for EMT’s break down as such:

Starting EMTs are paid 32,000/year. Our hourly base pay is adjusted to not go above or below the annual pay of 32,000/year. Meaning, different positions offer different pay and regardless of how many hours we work in those positions, we will make around $1000 bi-weekly after taxes. 

We are not paid overtime until we work over the designated number of hours for our position. 

For example: 
24 hour EMT— 120 hours/pay period at $9.78/hour (below minimum wage). 
12 hour EMT— 86 hours/pay period at $13.99/hour. 
10 hour EMT— 80 hours/pay period at $15.38/hour.

A 24 hour EMT doesn’t get paid overtime until they work beyond 120 hours in a 14 day period.
12 hour EMT doesn’t get paid overtime until working over 86 hours in a 14 day period. 
10 hour EMT doesn’t get paid overtime until they work over 80 hours in a 14 day period.

Our paystubs are impossible to read. Upon request I can show you how impossible they are to calculate and understand.

That aside, I do not see how 24 hour EMT’s are legally being paid below minimum wage, or how 12 and 24 hour EMTs are not being paid time and half after working 40 hours in a work week or 80 hours in a pay period. 

I also don’t understand the legality behind adjusting our base hourly wage to fit the 32,000 salary. Our checks have built in overtime that we don’t get paid for. 

Please help me with any resources or English breakdowns of the laws so I can understand if this is legal or not.

148,Need advice on what to do when an international small business won’t give a refund,11vn7oq,"Tl;dr, I’m from CA, USA and I’m wondering if small businesses are allowed to decline your request for a refund if they sent a faulty product? Is there a way to report a small business for not giving a refund? If so, would that cost money/would I need a lawyer? Or, am I just SOL?

In December 2022, I ordered custom shirts from an international (Chile, South America) small business (found on instagram), and when I received the products, the quality just wasn’t there; there were a lot of mistakes on the embroidery so the work looked messy. I sent them photos and asked how we could rectify the problem. They apologized for the mistakes and offered context about what happened and then said they “can’t give me a refund because financially they’re pretty bad off,” so they offered to send me other smaller products to compensate. I suggested that, if anything, I could get a partial refund just for the shipping (since international shipping was $35 (total cost: ~$85)), and they said they “don’t have the money at the moment so if I could wait a little longer [for them to send the money to me];” granted, they did say they “would give the refund if they could.” That was in late January 2023. Now it’s mid-March 2023 and, despite me reaching out to them twice a month for an update, they still haven’t responded, yet instagram shows me the read receipts that they’ve seen my messages. I totally understand that this can be stressful on their end trying to sustain themselves, but I also feel like it’s unfair that they’re not taking responsibility for customer dissatisfaction (especially when I’ve been understanding and patient with their situation). I just feel really frustrated that, if anything, I haven’t received an update on whether we can resolve this situation, because I’d really like to move forward and get my money back, even just a portion of it. I was wondering, if this lack of communication on their end continues, if it’s possible to report it somewhere/take action so I can get my money back? But, if I reported it somewhere, would it cost money to move forward, like if I need a lawyer or something? Because if I happen to need one + need to pay for one, then I feel like I should just accept that I’m SOL.

If it helps to know, their instagram doesn’t mention anything about a refund policy; I searched up that one of the only things that protects a small business from not giving a refund is if they state a specific no refund policy/etc? I also still have the faulty products unworn/unwashed; I’d send them back but that’d be additional shipping I don’t want to pay for, if they’re implying they can’t afford to pay for a return label, too. Please help if anyone knows anything. If I’m really just SOL, that’d be helpful to know, too. Thanks for reading.

He's a freelancer who works remotely and operates as a sole proprietorship LLC. He started the business when we were married and registered it at the home we shared. This home is now solely owned by me - he moved out when we legally separated in August 2021, and the title passed to me in October 2021. I assumed he'd eventually take steps to register his business at his new address.

I've been receiving mail addressed to his business since he left. Every time I receive a piece of mail, I have reached out via text and asked what he'd like me to do with it. Usually, he has me open it and send him pictures of the contents, then decides if it can be thrown away or not (in which case he comes to get it). Each time, I politely remind him that he needs to update the address where his business is registered. He says he will, but when I press him for a deadline, he gets angry and insists he'll take care of it. I just searched the New Jersey corporation registry, and his business is still registered at my address as of right now.

I am really not looking to have a confrontation with my ex if I don't have to - though we are on civil terms, we are not friendly and only communicate when necessary. So I guess I'm wondering a few things here:

1. Are there any potential consequences **for me** if he keeps the business registered at my home? 

2. If so, is there a way I can compel him to update the address? I'm not looking to be petty or vindictive, so preferably not the ""nuclear option"" - but I know from experience that he will not do this unless he absolutely has to. 

(To illustrate what I am dealing with here: Ex left a lot of his stuff at the house when he moved out. I spent 8 months asking him to come get it, and he kept insisting he would but refused to commit to a date. Finally, I sent him an email saying that if he didn't come for his stuff by X date, I would dispose of it all accordingly.

156,Suing HVAC contractor in Georgia State Court,11vm50j,"In 2015 I had a new AC system installed by a longstanding small business, ""W"". In 2019, the system failed; after a short series of breakdowns where they couldn't find the problem, I called in another contractor, ""S"". Originally W had said the condenser must just be a lemon, and they would replace it under warranty, but I'd have to pay a significant amount for labor. S couldn't find why the condenser was failing either, and ultimately made the same assumption. I hired him to replace it, and a few days later it failed again. This time S spent more time investigating the system under the house, and he found that the coil had been installed by people who didn't know what they were doing. 

On the day of the installation, two guys in their 20s arrived and went to the crawlspace to do what I was told would take less than 30 minutes. They were down there a couple of hours before an older guy showed up at the front door and said they'd called for him. He was down there another hour or so before he came out, and he headed straight for the front door, barely pausing to say that it wouldn't be much longer. What I later learned...the coil comes in its own metal box, and the basic installation is to remove the old box and insert the new one. Some installers will shave a few *minutes* off what usually takes around 30 by opening the box and sliding the old coil out and putting the new one inside. These guys did the latter--I suspect they hadn't been TAUGHT the former; the problem was, the new coil was designed to fit in a box that was 4 inches longer than the old one! So those fools had been down there CRUSHING the coil to fit into the old box. The insulation at the back of the case had been torn down, the coil fins were crushed and bent, the doors of the case were warped in front to cover the projecting components, and the front frame of the case itself was separated from the case and they had used metallic tape to cover the gap. As badly as it was done, in the shadows of the crawlspace it was hard to see until you were very close. 

W refused to take responsibility, so I sued them in Magistrate's Court. The pandemic intervened before the case finally came to trial in December 2022. There, W said, essentially, they had used an industrial grade metal tape from Amazon to cover the case's gap (they hadn't completely) and that the system was functional as they installed it. I lost the case because the judge said I need an expert witness, and I would need to appeal. My faith in the ""greatest justice system in the world"" has crumbled, and I have serious concerns about that judge: A) Why would he think that I would have paid thousands of dollars for a ""new"" piece of equipment that had been mangled? And B) Does he not know that there are no damages to be claimed in this case which would pay for an attorney to manage the intricacies of a higher court?!  I'm very disgusted with the court system and the cavernous gaps in logic in the way it is administered. But I have appealed to State Court and am working to prepare a full case myself. 

My first question has to do with Admissible Evidence. I plan to ask the manufacturer to weigh in on the condition of the coils and what a proper installation looks like; *what should I ask for to make it admissible?* That is, do I have to arrange a deposition in another state? Can they simply provide a notarized letter?

Second, *how do I arrange depositions?* Do I just look up court reporters in the area, and how are fees set? I'm trusting that I can get these reimbursed as part of the court fees since the magistrate asked for it.

Third, I am seriously considering asking for a jury trial. *How do I go about requesting a jury?* I know it seems ridiculous to ask for 12 people to take time to sit in on this type of case, but my faith in judges is now abysmally low. Then of course, my next concerns would be questions for jury selection; in my mind I keep coming to one about whether they'd (be dumb enough to) consider paying thousands of full-price dollars for something ""new"" that had been badly damaged, and I can't get past it.",opendoor7777,9,3,0.8

After making our way from downtown we stopped at our local hole in the wall bar. Upon entering the back door we ordered our drinks and sat at a table away from the crowded bar. 

I went next door at the request of my group to see how busy it was. Upon coming back I went through the front door (instead of the back) where I was asked to present ID once well within the bar and almost to my seat not at the door.  (by the security guard/ID checker who the company hired for one day he is not part of any company or group) 

I presented my ID even though this guy has seen me in here multiple times and then went to walk away to sit down with my friends who were watching everything go down. 

At which point I was grabbed from my the hood of my hoodie and thrown into the glass front door. Smacking my head. Then was thrown out the door onto a table and into a metal railing where I hit my head again. The employees came out and asked him what he was doinh as they know me as a regular and stopped everything. To which point I went back inside (yes I was allowed back in and shouldn’t have ever even kicked out or the employees words) to attempt to finish my drink. 

Ended up just leaving cause was confused at what happened. 

I know the owner and messaged him. I requested the tapes as well as the guys name so I can file proper reports and he has avoided me or given me the run around saying he is busy and will get to it when we can however I think an assault at your establishment is worth making effort for.

161,Utility tree workers ruined my property when I wasn't home,11vldpk,"Okay, so I want to report this properly because This was done without consent, warning and when I wasn't home. Any help is appreciated.

&#x200B;

Last week we had a storm and a couple of days after there was a utility vehicle parked on the road beside my property. They were looking up the hill and I thought they might be planning to reroute the utility line that crossed over my property into the woods to make for easy access. I waved and said hi to them, let them do their thing and was going to ask them what was up before they left, but they left without me seeing. No one stopped by, no one talked to me. 

The following day my daughter and I had to go out of town, we left around 6am and returned about 11pm. While we were gone, the utility tree workers entered my property and cut 3 old growth trees to the ground, they left a huge log and a huge mess. They even destroyed my undergrowth landscaping consisting of 7 lilacs ( cut to the ground,, about 10 honeysuckle bushes (also cut to the ground) and my rhododendron that they broke irreparably. I called our utility company here in central NY (NYSEG)  but was told to file a claim online. I was not given the web address and am not certain of the name of the tree service that was used.. 

Later that day another utility crew stopped by and I expressed my disapproval. The foreman told me my privacy garden should not have been destroyed and that the shrubbery should never have been cut. He was also surprised at how many trees they removed and what they left behind. The lines are still entangled in the trees that remain, but two of the trees taken didn't come near the lines and were hard wood (those logs were removed, the pine was left behind and only partially cut up). He said they wanted to remove the remaining trees as well, but also said I should file a claim. Notice was supposed to be given and he said the way this was done was obvious it was done without consent and without me being alerted. I've owned the property for over 10 years and requested that they trim the trees around the wires when I purchased. They come through every year and no upkeep was ever done. If the maintenance was done regularly, they would not have had to remove the trees as they were all healthy. How do I file a claim and what rights do I have as a landowner? Can I request that they replace those trees with ones that will not grow as high  and demand they replace the remainder of my garden that was destroyed? That area gave privacy and curb appeal, now it's an eye sore.

167,Splitting equity with spouse who is putting down payment,11vkl0g,"My spouse and I are considering purchasing with her putting down a large percentage of the down payment using some inheritance received in past 5 years. This would push the timeline of home ownership forward and both are in agreement of how we would split the mortgage payments going forward. 

With regards to legal equity of the home, would a post-nup agreement satisfy percentage ownership by time of future sale (this won’t be our forever home)? 

Example: Home is 500k. She puts in 200k down payment and we split mortgage. 5 years later we sell the house with none to little appreciation. After 5 years I end up putting 100k into the mortgage and she puts in 100k. End result is 300k on her end and 100k on my end. Our sale would result in her committing 60% and I would have committed 20%.

Is the above a normal equity split in case a divorce occurs? I understand she or I would have an option of buying the other out as well.

He reaches out to me whenever he wants. 

He constantly drives around where I stay. 
He knows it creeps me out. 


I tried multiple times to get him to stop. 
He flaunted his new gf in my instead and allowed her to read my messages to him. 

Now months later, I keep getting messages from random people asking to meet up with me in sketchy places and it feels like it's him or his gf based on info. I have been having a hard time sleeping. Recurring sleep paralysis and I'm back to hyperventilating every time I see a car that resembles any of his vehicles. 


I reached out again to ask him to stop and wish him the best and to let him know my fiance and I do not want drama and for him to tell people to stop. Also told him I do not want to receive those type of messages anymore.

He threatened to file harassment claim. 

I told him I would file too.

It's been tough on me. Haven't been sleeping well. Haven't been able to open up to my partner much about it.

What I didn't tell him is that I am thinking about filing a sexual assault claim against him. I didn't before because I was scared and had no proof. At least now I have proof that I messaged him about what he did to me.

Can he file a harassment claim when he keeps driving around my place? I don't have much evidence besides the messages I send him about it. 

Also, can I still file a sexual assault claim? I tried not to for the sake of his daughter and the fact that I did not have evidence for a sexual assault claim. I have messages I sent to him but he never acknowledged them.

170,Someone in our school is trying to murder our friend - what and who should we talk to?,11vk1gu,"Location: Sweden, Europe

I have no idea if this is considered NSFW but this is quite disturbing. I also don't know if this is supposed to be in this subreddit.

This is not a shitpost. 

TLDR; A person in our grade has told a friend of ours that she would like to murder one of my closest friend and asked if another friend would like to help her. The friend told us about the situation and we strongly believe we should report her to someone. But we don’t know what to do or who to talk to. Advice? 

/////

There’s a lot to explain and I will not go in any further detail as it is very obnoxious. I’m happy to take advice and questions.

It all started when this girl, (who we’ll call) Sarah joined my friend’s (Alex) Spanish class. She quickly became obsessed with our friend group and started stalking some people. Not the basic “stalking online” or “checking the parent’s Facebook” but actually hiding in front of Alex’s house. The first time she did this, he saw Sarah and told her that if this would happen again he would report her to police. And he was serious. 

After that, we really thought it was over as nothing really happened, or so we thought.

&#x200B;

Despite Alex telling her to stop, she did this four more times and told our friend Claire (who Sarah think is her best friend) about it. Alex doesn’t know about this as this would freak him out. Fast forward, Sarah has told Claire that she believes in some sort of ""angles"" who tell her what to do. She also think that she and Alex are somehow connected and that they are meant to be soulmates - just that he doesn't want to accept the fact yet. Claire explained that Sarah once took a ""BDSM-test"" and her results were ""99% sadism"". Obviously, she seems very ill and she needs someone to help her, but the following is so disgustingly hideous it makes me think she needs something like a mental hospital.

&#x200B;

Claire has told me that Sarah is very obsessed with everyone in the friend group, everyone except for my closest friend Lucas. For some reason, she does not like him at all, and wants to get rid of him - for good. Apparently, she is very serious with this. Last week, Claire sat in a phone call with Sarah while I sat beside her listening on speaker (Sarah had no idea of my presence of course). She explained how it would feel super nice to just stab him with a knife in the chest - and she even said she could do this in school. This terrified me as I did not think it was this serious and we quickly told both Lucas and Alex about it. We agreed that we have to talk to someone but we have no idea who. We considered talking to police, but all of us just recently turned 18 and we have no idea how it works. We then thought about it and instead booked a meeting with the principal in a couple days, but I am still sceptical and I keep thinking if this is the right decision or not. 

We really need any advice we can get on what to do and if we should talk to someone. As quickly as possible.",atonedal2,7,0,0.17

We were back and forth for months and she did nothing. Finally in Feb 2023 we got a new apartment starting March 1. We asked them to find a new attendant and were very accommodating but they only found one for April 1 and are demanding March rent.

I kept most of my personal life out of our conversations unless she asked for advice about coping mechanisms and sobriety. I started doing some volunteer work for a couple DV women's shelters around our area and she was aware that I was also a DV survivor and struggled with substance abuse in the past. 

A couple weeks ago she asked to talk to me about women's shelters and I told her I've stayed in a few shelters when I was fleeing my abuser and asked if she was looking to go into one. She said she was thinking about it because her boyfriend got physical with her during an argument and I immediately started compiling some resources for her as well as explaining the process of getting into one.

In our separation, my wife bought a house. She just lost her job a week ago.. I have a stable job still but her income has been cut in half. The benefits at my job and the fact that she is listed as a beneficiary to them would allow her to have the baby for little to no cost.

I'm wondering if I should expedite my divorce with an infidelity clause because I don't want to be used just because she fell on hard times.. no pun intended. But I fear this may be perceived as an act of revenge. Am I overthinking things or should I take swift action? I am still in love with her and want to be there for my daughter.

184,"We (3 females) found termites in the place we’re currently renting in California, and the landlord wants us to just permanently move without any compensation. What should we do?",11vf8tg,"This is my first post asking for help and it’s a bit of a story but hang in there. 

We recently found termites in the house that we’ve been renting for only 2 months in Southern California. It seems like they have already eaten a part of the structural beam and are all over the house. They will most likely have to fumigate and do some construction on the house, but our landlord cannot give us a time frame of when it’ll be done. They asked us to (permanently) move out, with the possibility of moving back if we want to after everything is done. We’ll happily do so if they can accommodate our needs. We’ve also had a bad start to this landlord/tenant relationship due to other things but that’s a story for another post. 

We’ve done some research ourselves as well regarding temporary relocation and what to do regarding termite infestation. We found that our landlord is to pay for temporary relocation assistance to the tenants, including the higher rent at the temporary location or hotel costs, moving and packing all personal property, costs of moving machinery or equipment, etc. 

So far our landlord is still waiting to hear back from their insurance company and has repeatedly urged us to start packing to move out due to a concern over our safety. They want us to move out EVERYTHING and has said that we can come back after the process IF WE WANT. To that, we proposed that they give us our deposit, a month of rent, and reimbursement to hire movers to move permanently into a different place. Like I mentioned, we are young females (one still in high school) and one of us have a fractured finger so moving furniture and other heavy items will not be easy. Our landlords keep coming at us saying the termites were a shock to them and they didn’t wish for this to happen and that expenses are heavy on them as is. They explained that they had to take out a loan to do construction on the rental property and even had a recent car accident and had been nice to us by immediately getting an exterminator to check the house. Btw, they have multiple rental properties and have been landlords for a long time (according to them). I think they’re trying to make us feel guilty and just move out permanently. 

We, as tenants, gave them two options. 1) we move out permanently but they cover movers, deposit, and one month rent. 2) they provide us temporary relocation assistance either to a hotel or Airbnb and cover movers+storage fee because they require us to move everything out for fumigation and construction. Is this too much to ask for?because finding a new place in a certain neighborhood is not easy and it’s stressful for us too. As much as we would love to move out because as our landlord said, “who would want to live in a house with termites,” we’re having difficulty asking for any sort of compensation. They think we don’t want to move out and that we want to risk our safety over proper compensation.

So, what should we do here? Are we asking for too much? Are we in the right to ask for the required compensation or did we misinterpret the California housing codes wrong :|",SnooDoubts3824,10,0,0.33

186,Can I be fired from my healthcare job for going into a psychiatric hospital?,11veeu3,"So, I’ve been doing really well the last 3 months. I’ve stayed sober and out of the hospital!! I was going inpatient 2x a month before that. 

For context, I have schizoaffective bipolar type (an easy way to think about this is I have bipolar 1 and schizophrenia combined into one diagnosis). This has been well documented. I also had sobriety issues with cannabis (and other drugs but primarily cannabis). See, the THC in cannabis triggers my schizoaffective disorder to the point where I become completely destabilized and have to be hospitalized. Now, that disorder can get bad without the cannabis and started before I used cannabis. It’s just that cannabis makes it so much worse.

So, I relapsed and ate cannabis edibles over the last 3 days. Im not high anymore. I live somewhere where regular cannabis is illegal but the delta 8 stuff is legal (which is what I had). 

But, now today, I’m scared. I know I’m living in a simulation and that everyone except me and the angels I’m hearing are robots. The voices are telling me how to kill myself (basically OD’ing on my sleep meds and edibles as I had one sleeping med and an edible the other day and I stopped breathing a couple of times since they are both depressants). I don’t know if I’m gonna act on that or not. I called my on-call psychiatrist (before the angels started telling me to kill myself) and she said to call back if I have thoughts of harming myself. I called the local psych hospital and they said if I can’t keep myself safe then to call back.

Im now at the point where I’m not sure if I need psychiatric inpatient. The biggest thing holding me back from going is that I started a new job 2 months ago. I do the work of a CNA just without the CNA certificate (officially called a caregiver). I was told if we miss more than 4 days in the first 90 days we’ll be fired. Does this extend to being hospitalized? 

I’ve had a conversation with my boss about my schizoaffective diagnosis. All she said was if I show symptoms at work I’ll be drug tested. Also, the attendance at work is so strict that even if we are super sick, if we don’t find our own coverage we can get written up.

Sorry if this was a mess. I just need to know if I go inpatient if I could lose my job or not.",TheHyperIntrovert,3,0,0.33
187,TN: Can Kroger be held liable for vehicle damage for a poorly built and placed curb over 1ft tall that appears to be hit alot?,11ve6dt,"Tennessee, My wife made a mistake, but I question the construction of a newly installed curb and the heavy amount of marks that indicate we may not be the only ones who have hit this curb. The Kroger has a Rx drive through. And for 10 years you pulled straight out. They recently renovated and this entire area is new. Instead of coming straight out, you have to turn and merge into a passby lane before leaving the drive-through. The 100% useless curb is over 1ft tall and caused damage to both side doors and the rear 1/4 panel of our 2018 Honda Odyssey Elite. I'm guessing 4k in damage but will get quotes this week.

Do we have any grounds on getting it paid for or having the curb fixed? Thanks!",FireGuyUSA,6,0,0.15
188,Do I have a case as a nurse?,11ve0nh,"I am copy and pasting what happened to me tonight. After you read them, understand that I work for a staffing agency. This facility that I had signed up for contacted the agency in hopes of having me reported evidently so they could jeopardize my license saying I abandoned my patients. That's not the case  though. I refused to count with them and take the keys to the cart because I would not be put in a situation to be responsible for 50 people. Do I have any valid reason that I can sue them? We as nurses have been taken advantage of for way too long (long hours, no breaks, understaffed) and I refuse to jeopardize my license and my patients lives by working extremely understaffed. I just need advice. If no one ever takes a stand against these facilities they are going to continue these practices. I am in GA. Thank you! Any advice on how to proceed is very appreciated. 

Below is a copy the messages:

Staffing Agency***Hello. C---- Health says you walked out during your shift. Are you still there?

Me*****I spoke with On-Call and told them the situation and I would not count with them until I knew what was going on. I was going to have right at 50 patients on my own the whole shift where as there is supposed to be a 7-11p nurse to get that night medicine out. That is too high of a patient to nurse ratio and it is illegal to expect me to do that. I will be reporting them to state tomorrow! I told them that I would not stay if there was no one there to do that part. On call documented it. I drove 45 minutes there and was there until 745 and didn't get a time sheet filled out. I am very upset with this! I will never return to that facility again. I will not risk my nursing license or my patients safety because they don't have management that will come in and do what they are supposed to do if they don't have proper coverage. So yes. I did leave. I refused to count and would not take keys and be responsible for them. I've been a nurse for 20 years and know for a fact that is illegal.

Staffing Agency****The facility stated you did not stay long enough to find out. 
We wish you would not have left though. We would have helped look for staff as well.

Me*****I spoke with on call and it was already 745. The day shift nurse was still passing medicine on the cart that I was supposed to have. I stayed long enough to know that there would not be another nurse there for hours if they did get someone and I refuse to be responsible for that many patients. I have never in my life experienced this kind of situation and I will report them. I have worked many years in management and know they have on call rotation and whomever was on call should have been there at 7p to take that cart until they had someone. 
I'm very sorry. This is not my nature but I know that I can't take care of 50 people at once. There are many scenarios that could happen with multiple patients at the same time and if someone lost their life because I couldn't get to them then I would be held responsible for that. I've been a nurse long enough to know that these situations do happen.
You can go ahead and cancel the remaining shifts I am signed up for because I will not step foot back in that facility. Thank you 

Staffing Agency****Ok thank you for letting us know

Me*****You're welcome
Will I get any compensation at all or not? 

Staffing Agency****I will have your recruiter follow up with you on Monday

Me*****There shall be sufficient nursing staff on duty at all times to provide care for each patient according to his needs. A minimum of 2.0 hours of direct nursing care per patient in a 24-hour period must be provided. 
Wanted to send you this. When you calculate the hours divided between 7a-7p and 7p to 7a nurse, you are legally not supposed to have more than 24 patients. This is Rules and Regulations for the State of GA

Staffing Agency****Ok thanks so much for sending. I will be sure that you recruiter sees this

189,Can't get Real ID cause marriage certificate,11ve0cf,"I (43f) have been married ione time about 20ish years ago.  We were young, shit didn't work and because we were married less than one year we got an annulment as apposed to divorce.  Legally it's like it didn't happen, I guess?

Anyway my maiden name was Herkimer (fake) and for personal reasons I was pretty done with it.  When I married I changed ally details to Smith (also, fake but also very common last name).  For reasons, I wanted to distance from my birth family and the anonymity of a name like Smith was appealing. I changedy Ss card and licence and when we split up 7-8 months later I never changed back.

20 years later I can't use a plane cause I dont have a real ID cause my name doesn't match my BC and because the marriage was annulled I can't get a copy of the license cause it was redacted or deleted.

192,i (27F) had a one night stand with someone who i later found out was in prison,11vdupu,"i am taking full responsibility for my actions but i do have questions. please help. 

Wednesday night, i got too drunk and was irresponsible. i had unprotected sex with someone i had only known for a few hours. he was not drunk, only i was. he ejaculated inside me without my consent and i had to take plan b. however, plan b does not work if you are already ovulating and of course, it's not always effective even when taken properly. 

again, i do take responsibility for my part in this but as i reflect i am becoming more and more concerned. he knew i was intoxicated but we still had sex. he finished inside me without that ever being agreed upon. 

the next morning, he told me he did not have a bank account and asked me to order him an uber to work. then later that day, he texted me to ask to see me again to ""order food and watch a movie at my place"" all in which he wanted me to pay for. his ride to my place, the food and his ride back from my house. i said no. at that point, i was even more repulsed by him and wanted to understand why the fuck he was so lost in life at his age. no car, no bank account (only cash), no drivers license, no HOME (he said he's one with nature and lives in a tent). he told me it was because he was in prison for a while and was trying to get his shit back in order. 

i tried not to judge his situation but it's like...what was he in prison for, i ask myself. he also revealed later that he was two kids who he obviously does not see. 

my question is, with his history being the way it is and his current mind set being how it is, is what he did sexually wrong? is ejaculating inside someone during sex without their consent wrong or am i being ""sensitive""? should i feel like i am to blame because i had sex with him while i was drunk? 

after that night and finding out all the red flags the following day, i blocked him. we are not in contact but i just want answers so i can either tell myself i am being stupid or if i was truly violated.",DissolvingPecan,5,0,0.13

194,Oregon. Got “secret admirer” texts. Found out they are from a leasing agent at my apartment complex. How do I handle this?,11vdf9x,"For the last few days, I have been getting texts from a number I don’t know, telling me they think I’m super attractive and want to date me asking about my sexual orientation and if I wanted to be FWB.

He basically went into my renter’s file, took my number and proceeded to harass me. I am fairly certain I am not the first and worried I won’t be the last. This feel so gross and like a huge violation. What can I do about it?

195,She gave him a key??!,11vcwzj,"Hi I’m not exactly sure if i’m posting in the write place or whatever but I need some legal advice. 
So I (17F) have been living with my roommate (19F) since August of 2022. We share a dorm at a college in Tx. After moving in, we came to an understanding that we weren’t going to be best friends but we could be civil. (we agreed not to use other stuff etc..) 
However, the real issue I have is with my roommates boyfriend. He has since moved into our shared dorm. I had no prior knowledge to this situation otherwise I would’ve outwardly expressed some concern. Due to issues in the past with my roommate I decided to pick and choose my battles. 
The main issue-This previous week was spring break. My family relocated across the state. Therefore, I couldn’t go home for spring break, So I stayed in my dorm. However, my roommate left to go home (about 4 hours away). Naturally I assumed that, her boyfriend, would stay at his house. This was not the case. On Wednesday this previous week, I nearly had a heart attack because someone had come into my dorm banging stuff around. I seriously feared for my safety and well being. Immediately, I texted my roommate asking if she was home. She told me that she wasn’t home right now but her boyfriend was & she was at work. To make things worse, she gave him a key to our shared dorm and he came and went as he pleased all through spring break even bringing his dog.
Here are my main issues:
-I contacted the CA twice but they were not much help.
-I genuinely feared for my safety because I knew my roommate hadn’t been home and someone walked into my home.
-It’s against school policy to give keys to other people. Let alone let someone stay over for my than 3 conservative nights.

Despite seeing clips of the game on YouTube, I understand that such use may be considered copyright infringement.

200,Eviction of an unlawful guest/resident from a tenant in Washington State,11vbzst,"They are two people who signed no contracts but have given money at one point, but also threatened violence.

The initial issue is the people who haven’t paid rent, aren’t on the lease, and refuse to leave had some violent threats. About the money: The first paid the agreed first months rent and the second payed first months rent late. They haven’t paid this months rent. It is the second month an they haven’t left, even after having another person, who didn’t pay rent and wasn’t on a lease, kicked out. 

The first person-with-no-lease threatened violence when only my girlfriend was at the residency with them, and they have a violent criminal record, which is why both illegal guests need to get the fuck out.

They have pets and belongings in the apartment in their room. The address isn’t on their legal paperwork or been sent to the house as all mail to the address has stop being sent by the post office months ago.  Thy have not been there 90 days, either of them. I have paid the rent myself, in whole, all but one month in which they paid half. 

As the lease-holder i did research and need a few questions answered before i can change the lock, give their animals to a pound, and leave their shit on the curb:

How much room do I legally have to remove them from the premises?
Do they have any laws protecting them from eviction or ejection?
Are they considered guests or residents, and if they can be banned from the residence by the owner of the property?
As the only legal tenant of the residency am I allowed to force them out?
Can they be kicked out in anyway because of the threat if violence that is in writing from their text messages?
Are there literally ANY loopholes to getting  the non-contracted, criminally evicted for violent crimes person OUT?

203,Bought a Misrepresented Car,11vbt0x,"Ok. So i bought a 2013 Honda Civic from Facebook under the impression that the car had 113,000 miles. The digital odometer even read 113,000 miles.

When I took the title to register it at the DMV, the DMV told me that the car's last recorded mileage was 185,000 in 2019.  Not only that, but there was also an issue with the title since the seller hadn't transferred it in his name yet.

In order to rectify both the discrepancy with the odometer and the seller not transfering the title in his name before selling it to me, the DMV had me go back to the seller in order to fill out a bill of sales form. The bill of sales form also had an odometer option where I could explain the reason for the odometer discrepancy.

Anyways, I tell the seller that I was falsely mislead into thinking the car had 113,000 miles on it. The seller claims that he had no role in rolling back the odometer and that the other person he got it from must have done it. I told him that that didn't matter since he advertised on facebook that the car had 113,000 miles on it and even if he answered truthfully to the best of his knowledge, that I was still mislead into buying a car with 113,000 miles and that if I knew the engine could have easily 300,000 miles on it since the last recorded mileage with the DMV was back in 2019 woth 185,000 miles.

Moreover, the DMV made me wrote an affadavit attesting that I had nothing to do with rolling back the odometer and that if I had known the correct mileage, that I would not have purchased the car.

I told him I wanted my money back and ever since then he had ceased communications with me. I have copies of our messages and also took a screenshot of the car he posted on facebook with the odometer details and everything.

I don't want to take the guy to small claims court as I have read that the court will not compel him to pay and that it would essentially be me that has to be the debt collector if I were to win.

205,Is my employer restricting my access to drinking water? If so who do I tell?,11vbg25,"Hi. I live in Washington State, USA. Bear with me. I have never heard of a policy like this. I have been fighting it for weeks by telling my employer it is straight up illegal/ against OSHA policy and I’m about to take it to HR but I want to know if I should…. 

I work in the food service industry, basically for a fast food, burger joint. Not a huge well known one, it’s well known locally, but let’s just say a certain big tech guy loves our chain. 

The way drinking water works in our restaurant is when you first get hired you are given a reusable, washable food, service style plastic cup (like those coke/Pepsi ones, only 12oz). You get to use it for unlimited tea, water, soda, (and a shake but only on lunches). 

What you usually aren’t told until the first time it happens is, if you forget to wash or put your cup in the dish pit at the end of the shift, your cup goes to “cup jail” and you have to pay $1 USD to get it back. If you don’t have the dollar sometimes your manager will have mercy on you and let you have your cup (you will end up paying the money the same day). If your cup stays in cup jail, you have to bring your own cup in, which can also be jailed if it is forgotten. 
In other words, it doesn’t even matter if you bring your own cup in it will still end up being confiscated if you accidentally forget your drink or cup. This severely upsets me because for weeks nobody told me my cup was in cup jail and I was *using a random fucking one with no name label that one of my coworkers was also using on days when I wasn’t there.* when I finally brought my own in my mom etched my name into *it was jailed. A sovereign cup, I tell you!!!*. I am MAD. So what is the solution? 

I had an energy drink today, and I ended up bringing in my own water during my lunch, because I literally had no cup to use, but then I went back to using the unlabeled cup again, because my can of sparkling water got tossed by someone and I got fussed at by the same coworker that keeps putting it in “cup jail” that I “need to pay a dollar to use it”. Excuse me? I had an 8 hour shift I can’t drink water during?  What? And she said “no you just need to bring a dollar!” WHAT???? I AM SO UNCLEAR ON HOW THIS IS LEGAL????

Edit:: I don’t think i was clear enough in the original post about this as well— I’ll paste from a comment “kinda assumed it was stealing though since they also do it with cups or bottles you bring in from home. Even if you’re not out of the building yet. As soon as you clock out it goes to “jail” and you have to pay for your own item back. It’s not just the water it’s the actual cup I’m also worried about.” You can bring your own cup not provided by them and have to pay to get it back.

It is also up to your manager’s discretion to let you get your cup temporarily to pay later or not. If you have any cups already in cup jail, they will not let you do it. You just have to do without. It doesn’t matter what is wrong or if you have medical issues. It doesn’t matter if you have UTI’s or kidney stones both of which I’ve seen my coworkers have and simply go without water.",ContractSouth5574,9,0,0.18

207,Trespasser is cutting down trees on neighborhood land - what are my options?,11vbd8f,"Hi all, 

Executive summary: A farm hand (with a long and aggressive criminal record) on the farm adjacent to my subdivision is cutting down trees in a woods that is considered “community open space” for the neighborhood that backs to my property.  The person in question has a long criminal record and just recently got out of prison, so I’m worried confronting him will put me, and my family, at risk.  What are my options to make this stop?

The longer version: 

I live in a small subdivision in rural MD that sits adjacent to an approximate 40 acre farm.  It’s a deeded neighborhood with a HOA that is, essentially, inactive.  No leadership, dues collected, community maintenance, etc. The neighborhood includes several sections of “community open space” (ie: retention basin, and a large woods/creek area).  My property backs to the woods and is adjacent to the farm. 

Several years ago, the farm hand who resides on the farm (owner is elderly, so this guy maintains the property in exchange for squatting there) started driving into the community space behind my yard and “logging” the woods, cutting down trees, dragging them back to his property with his tractor, and selling the millings as “rough sawn hardwood” on Facebook marketplace.  This stopped before I had to take any action because he went to prison for unrelated crimes (burglary, sentenced to 18 years, served 2, out on probation for about 2-3 years now). 

Now, the logging has started again, he cut down a huge oak today that is very much on neighborhood property.  As this is happening right behind my house, it clearly bothers me more than most of the neighbors as he’s chopping down trees in what FEELS like my back yard, not to mention ruining part of the scenery we bought this house for in the first place. 

My problem is, I’m not really sure who to call or how to stop this. 

1. Given his violent criminal history (assault, armed robbery, domestic abuse) I am hesitant to confront him directly, painting a target on myself or my family.  After all, he lives “next door.” 

2. The land is not technically mine, it’s community open space owned by the neighborhood and HOA that doesn’t exist. 

It should be noted, the land doesn’t belong to him either! 

Our deeds state that the community open space may not be substantially altered (ie: trees removed). 

3. Without video/photos incriminating him - I can’t see a good way to prove it’s him (which would mean getting close enough to take photos, thereby opening myself up to confrontation). 

4. Even if I involve the police - I’m not sure what can really be done to remain anonymous and get this to stop.  Given the location, there are only about 3 neighbors who could see this happening, and I’m the most adjacent. 

5. Legally speaking, the HOA only exists on paper and has no money or leadership to fight a legal battle, so it’s very likely I’d need to foot the bills for a legal battle. This guy s doesn’t have two cents to rub together so I’m not sure suing him would have any effect. 

Ideally, this is criminal (trespassing, destruction of property) - I’d love to see him return to prison as we’d all feel safer for a couple of years. But since it isn’t my property being destroyed, technically I’m not sure how this would play out.  Is local law enforcement the best first call to make?",rwberinger86,5,35,0.94

217,My “friends” stole my dog.,11vap6h,"The crime happened in California. This last summer, I had a breakdown. I thought I had maybe saw or felt spirits, and I called my friend to tell her what happened and get help. She was going somewhere that day and said she would stop by to see me, but I guessed I rushed  her so she told me she would send some people to check on me. Lo and behold I open up the door and it’s the 51/50 people, shortly followed by the police who take me to the psych ward. After that happened, my friend came to my apartment and took my puppy. After I spend 10 days in the hospital, I’m out, and I call my friend to ask for my dog back. She talks about how happy he is there and how they’re on vacation. Some time passed and it became clear that they weren’t going to give him to me. I called other members of their family and they went so far as to accuse me of neglecting my dog, all because when they came to take him, there was pee on the ground. He was a puppy. He had a small bladder, and probably got scared seeing me get snatched away, and anyways I had no idea what happened after I was gone, he could have peed in the time I was away. Regardless he was so spoilt so it makes my blood boil to think they could say that just from seeing a little accident he had. 

I called the police to get help and they told me she could be charged with grand theft of an animal. Then the police decide to drop the case because when they reviewed the body cam footage of me getting taken away, I said my friends were good people (I don’t remember this). They also called my mom, and she said they could take care of him while I was away so the police said they couldn’t do anything and if I wanted to get him back I’d have to sue my mom. It doesn’t make sense to me because my mom had no ownership of the dog and shouldn’t be able to make decisions like that. 

I don’t know what to do. The dog is AKC registered to my name. I have text messages saying they were going to give him back. I could sue for small claims but it would only get me money, not my dog back. The problem is I don’t have much money so I can’t hire a lawyer. If anyone can help me by telling me any pro bono or reduced rate lawyers that would be really appreciated. If you have any other ideas on what to do please please let me know.

222,Car warrant won't cover damage.,11vag7t,"Recently, my girlfriend was driving her 2014 Mazda CX-5 which she had purchased from a partnered Toyota dealership three months prior when the ball joint on the control arm broke during a low speed left hand turn. Unfortunately, several other components were damaged in the incident and the total repairs are expected to cost $2400 - $3600. My girlfriend purchased an extended warranty through AAGI which covers transmission, suspension, and engine failures. When the warranty company came out to inspect the damage, they said that they will not cover the damage because rust and corrosion caused the ball joint to fail(there is an exclusion in their contract for damage caused by rust and corrosion).
So, the problem that I and my girlfriend have is that, three months ago the car would have gone through used car prep where components of the car that are damaged would be inspected and replaced so it is ready for sale, and wee confirmed that this prep occured with the manager of the dealership. If the ball joint had rust and corrosion damage bad enough for it to fail like that, it absolutely would have noticed during inspection and the parts replaced before selling the car. The dealership even read the inspection report to us and it does not list the ball joints as an item that needed repair, and confirmed that if they had been damaged, they would have been replaced.
All this is to say that I do not believe that in less than three months, the ball joints could have gone from perfect conditions to completely rusty and corroded enough for them to just pop apart during a low speed turn. So, either the dealership failed at the used car prep or the ball joints were defective and broke for some other reason.
I am wondering if anyone has any advice on how/ if I can get the warranty company or dealership to pay for at least some of the damage?",Puzzleheaded_Rub8681,2,0,0.33

When he was digging out the area for the septic tank (even though the septic tank wasn’t even bought yet, plus he didn’t have lines marked either) he broke a part on his backhoe that he was using and this is the same backhoe he wanted to use to put the septic tank in.

225,"Can a NJ HOA force members to sign a blanket waiver of liability against it, while also charging for liability insurance? If my wife signs it, but I don't, and both names are on the deed, is it enforceable? Does this waiver appear fair to you, or should we look to change this?",11va2rj,"Hello!


The HOA for my community is asking its members to sign a waiver of liability and a covenant to not sue for the following topics:


 (1) I am to accept and assume any/all risk of injury or property damage whether caused by negligence of the HOA or otherwise.

(2) I am to waive and release all officers, directors of the HOA from any and all injuries and loss by present, future, foreseen, unforeseen circumstances related to usage of the areas in the HOA.
 
(3) Use of beach badges provided by the HOA waives HOA liability and covenants to not sue the HOA for ""any and all such claims""
       

The HOA leadership wants us to sign this waiver waiving all liability, but we are also paying $3900 in liability insurance and $2000 in officer liability. It seems we are paying liability insurance for when we are waiving all ability to take action in the first place. 


Is this two-pronged approach of the HOA taking money for liability insurance while also making members waive all ability to sue the HOA legal? 


Furthermore, if my wife signs the waiver, but I don't, is it still enforceable when both names are on the deed and votes for HOA meetings are given based on property ownership and we only get one vote as a household, possibly showing that property ownership is based on a bipartite approach toward our one vote? To me, it seems that in this case, if one person were not to sign, it wouldn't seem right. 


My wife and I have one vote together in HOA meetings as both our names are on the deed, so would it be enforceable for this waiver if only my wife signs it but I don't? It seems like both of us together is what creates the one vote, so I feel like it would only be enforceable if both of us sign the waiver.

228,Doc ignored messages. I have cancer,11v9q6c,"I called my doctor's office and had message sent describing symptoms and asking for a referral to specialist. No response.  8 days later I send another message.  RN asks what referral I'm talking about and just lists off 2 unrelated ones.  I restated symptoms and my request.  RN replies and acknowledges receipt, says she's forwarding on to doc or a covering provider if doc wasn't available.  This was all on that 8th day from initial message.

Still nothing comes back to me.

On day 19 I call and insist on someone talking to me and have a mssg sent because they wouldn't pick up.  Minutes later an RN calls from the office.  I restated symptoms again to her and she says I should go to ER and questions why I hadn't.  I insisted on also getting an appointment for the next day and could only get one via phone, but I took it.  This evening I went to ER but wasn't able to stay long enough to be seen.

So morning of day 20 comes and the PA calls me.  I restate again symptoms and he questions why I hadn't gone to ER because these symptoms definitely warrant it.  (If pain were more significant I would have, but it was intermittent)

I finally was able to get to ER that afternoon.  Tests and 7 hours later I have a neoplasm (cancer).  The ER doc was mad at my doc for not having me go in when I initially messaged them.  Not as mad as I was.

Obviously I'm changing docs but I'm preoccupied with taking care of what I can to protect my family from whatever will happen. 

Last thing I want is to deal with cancer and a lawsuit at the same time, but this can't be allowed to happen to anyone else.  Cancer got 3 weeks of unhindered growth and I don't know how much less damage may have been done if I had just been told it warranted an ER visit in the first place.

Other repair issues

Holes and peeling paint on walls in hallway. 

Fishy smelling sink water

The front desk people and even property manager promising to make repairs and either halfway doing the job or making up excuses for them to hold back on making them. 

The apartment staff siding with bad neighbors (blasting music, screaming, and having sex loud on purpose to annoy anybody who can hear.

The apartment staff claim they sent these people multiple letters and I have never seen a letter on their door or any sign whatsoever that they are taking action against these tenants.

The other’s roof has collapsed twice. Their prior tenants sprayed toxic chemicals without any warning to us neighbors (while we’ve had window ac’s adjacent to the structure). So we’ve inhaled the the toxic air and particles. 

The major and immediate concern is right next door. Their roof has collapsed before. Building is empty and there’s excessive mold on the buildings exterior. I can only imagine the current and future state of its interior. It’s also become a breeding ground for rodents and roaches (German roaches being the hardest to keep out of our building).

My boyfriend and I live together with a few roommates. One of the roommates that we live with has refused to pay the shared electric and gas bill, and despite my partner’s attempts to talk it through with him has essentially tried to blackmail/coerce him.

All of this started when said roommate’s girlfriend lost her keys in the house, and he accused us of taking the keys. We didn’t take the keys, but this roommate is convinced that we did because we were in the room the keys were last in right before they went missing. We told him that the couch in the shared living space has a void that things fall into (the keys ended up being exactly where we said they were) and they most likely were in there, but he said that we planted them there. 

We have written and verbal refusal from this roommate, as well as refusal to stop using our property when we told him we didn’t want him to use it anymore (we ended up moving most of our things out early into a storage unit due to this).

He has told my partner that he will not pay what is owed unless my boyfriend admits on camera to stealing the keys (which we did not do). As Minnesota is a one-party consent state, we have him recorded saying this.

236,Employer Tuition Reimbursement,11v8kd6,"Hi! I'm looking for advice on how to handle a situation with my employer. I have worked for the company for almost 20 years. Three years ago, I took advantage of their education reimbursement program and began working on a Bachelor's degree. The way it works is that I pay for my tuition and get reimbursed for every class I make at least a B in. My company's financial situation has been going downhill for the past year or so. Our HR director informed me yesterday that the tuition reimbursement program has been terminated as a cost-cutting measure and those of us in the program will no longer be reimbursed for tuition, including the current semester. My problem with that is it's right in the middle of the semester and I've paid my tuition and related expenses - to the tune of over $800. Several other employees have paid up to $2200 for this semester and we're essentially being screwed out of our money. Also, my employer has reimbursed me almost $15k so far.  The agreement states that the tuition will be forgiven over 3 years after I finish my degree. I won't finish for another 2-3 years (I'm going part-time since I work 40-50 hours/week). Since they have essentially broken the contract, shouldn't they start my 3-year forgiveness now, since they will not be reimbursing any future tuition? Is there anything I can do to make them honor the agreement and reimburse me for the current semester's tuition? 

Thanks in advance for any advice on this.",imnottellingyou53,6,1,0.6

239,Store that ends with Land and sells Pets is keeping my $5k puppy from me that I’ve paid for,11v83bx,"I met a healthy puppy on March 5, took a couple days to think about it. Did not like the idea of purchasing from this store but I fell head over heels for the puppy and decided to go ahead and pay an outrageous $5k for it. It isn’t the puppy’s fault where he ended up yet. Anyways, after a couple days my partner and I decided to go through with purchasing the puppy. I texted the sales rep and told her we want to take it home and she informed me that he had “sniffles” and he will be cleared by a vet in a couple days. This was March 9th. She put the pressure on to pay for it and sign paperwork that day so “no one else will be able to buy the puppy.” Part of that does say “no returns.” But I paid and signed for a puppy that wasn’t able to leave that day. March 9th was Thursday, she said it should be Tuesday, maybe Wednesday when it will be able to go home. Since I swiped my card, communication has ceased. I texted first on Monday to ask if he could still go home the next day. Then I’m told it will be Friday, March 17. I text first Thursday, the 16th, to confirm. Now he won’t be ready till the next Tuesday or Wednesday. I say I can give the puppy medicine, I’m just ready for him to be home and get him settled. Asked the rep to please discuss with her manager and the vet. Manager calls me, says it’s the vet not releasing the puppy. Call the vet and have the most unprofessional conversation and he tells me I shouldn’t have bought a sick puppy and the store is the owner as far as he is concerned. I say I literally have the receipt, I can email it over. Vet says no. I call the manager back and they tell me no returns. I say I don’t have the puppy and y’all can’t tell me where he is. Gives me a number to call for a refund. That number is a third party and buckled down on the now returns. If I don’t get my dog by March 22nd, I want to to take action. 

What are my options? I recorded the phone calls and have the texts I’ve made regarding the situation. Also I’m in Texas. Any help appreciated.

252,Clause in lease about condition of the apartment and how it might relate to my case? Does it even matter?,11v6wlp,"Hello,
Just wanted to ask for some insight on my situation. 
I signed a lease a bit over a month ago for an apartment and moved in a week ago. When I first viewed the apartment, the tenant was still living there and she said she had no problems at all. Place looked great and didn’t see any issues. 

I came in about 2 weeks ago a few days technically past my “move in day” to do a little cleaning.  I saw roach feces scattered all over an outlet the cabinets and a dead roach on top of the cabinet. Of course I reached out to the landlord to address this, and he cleaned it and said he sprayed but didn’t really tackle much of the problem in the cabinets. I decide to move in slowly while I hire a cleaner and exterminator.
A week later I’ve moved in. I see roach feces in my fridge and dead roaches in my freezer a day after (I believe the dead roaches may have been in the freeezer already but I never looked hard enough). I tell the landlord about this and it takes him a few days because he’s away but he decides to come to my apartment and take apart all the cabinets and caulk holes. See a few roaches and alot of roach poop and alot of holes. He till doesn’t do anything about the fridge or gasket though and will not hire an exterminator, telling me to wait for the one that comes the first Saturday of every month. He continues to act surprised saying that this has never happened before and the previous tenant never complained about pests (she told me she had no issues either). I have photo evidence of everything above btw.

At this point, I don’t really feel comfortable in my own apartment anymore. 

There is a clause in my lease about the apartment and it reads such: 
“When You signed this Lease, You did not rely on anything said by Owner, Owner's agent or superintendent about the physical condition of the Apartment, the Building or the land on which it is built. You did not rely on any promises as to what would be done, unless what was said or promised is written in this Lease and signed by both You and Owner or found in Owner's floor plans or brochure shown to You before You signed the Lease. Before signing this Lease, You have inspected the apartment and You accept it in its present condition ""as is,"" except for any condition which You could not reasonably have seen during your inspection. You agree that Owner has not promised to do any work in the Apartment except as specified in attached ""Work"" rider.”

I was wondering if this line was something that could be used to break a lease if it gets to that point for me. I understand that roaches are normal in apartment buildings but I feel I was presented an apartment that was not in a clean and habitable state and it has taken its toll on me in the past few days.

255,Validity of indecent conduct written warning (Ohio),11v6iu5,"Hello all. Not sure of correct flair for this, and this is a throw away account if that matters.

Had hopefully a straightforward legal question to help me process something.

Getting right to it, my fiancee and I were just a little while ago, Frankly, making out, when a cop appeared at our window.

For context: we were at a 100% empty aprk when it was cold out, and light snow so very unlikely any one would show up. All clothes were on the entire time. She was about halfway in the passenger seat and partially on me. Admittedly, my hand was also on her rear end.

The officer (a ranger I think) ended up giving us a written warning for ""indecent conduct"". He said if it happens again it could be escalated, get a ticket and potentially register as a sex offender or something.

When looking up Ohio's public indecency laws, I see two things, one it has to be likely to be seen by other people, it was not as it was empty and that first offense is a fourth degree misdemeanor:
https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-2907.09

Now I understand what we did was likely not smart, we get that. But to me it feels like what he said was a exaggeration? Would I be correct? Or is he completely right or what?

Also just for extra detail he was standing outside the car window for at least a minute or two, seemingly watching us. He never knocked on our window, we saw him and opened the door. He may have been waiting to see if we were going to escalate but it gave us both bad vibes.

Our home is in a suburb managed by the county so we are not on city water, our water is managed by a small company ran by a volunteer group of homeowners in the area. Last summer they delivered everyone in the neighborhood a letter saying one of the wells they use to provide homes with water had dried up and the other was very low. This was news to us and when I bought the house in 2019 there was no information shared with me about wells running low. They were seeking funds to dig a new well but wanted everyone to pay $2,000. My wife was pregnant with our second child at the time, we were paying for my older daughter to go to pre school, and I was paying for my masters out of my own pocket so I could not afford to just pay that right then and there. I was told at the time by the person who brought me the letter that payment plans would be an option. Not long after I contacted the manager of the water company about setting up a payment plan and what options I had. He was adamant that I pay it in full, but I told him I couldn’t and was told I could set up a payment plan and wanted to know what options I had. He told they weren’t really wanting to do that but that they approved a 4 time $500 plan for another homeowner. I asked what the other options were just to weight my options and was told “the board won’t accept anything less than that” and that I should look into getting a loan. Lol. 

I told him I would talk to my wife but asked what would happen if I can’t pay $500 a month for 4 months and he said “I guess I would have to tell the board you can’t make your payment and if you don’t make your payment our neighborhood will run out of water”. Fast forward to September of last year this man with 2 other men who were also board members showed up at my house on a Sunday afternoon asking for my payment again. I brought up the same questions and was given the same answers. They told me they would need my payment by the end of the year and again I asked what if I can’t pay the full amount by then? I asked again about payment plans because I am a homeowner in the neighborhood, I care about the issue and want to contribute, but the message I was given was still basically all or nothing with no info about payment plans.

267,"Small claims lawsuit: Apartment exaggerated damages, created bogus receipt items, pulled from my credit card without authorization",11v5jxw,"2 months after my lease had ended, the apartment just directly charged my credit card bogus charges (fake or no receipt items) without my signatures nor acknowledgment. Due to the unauthorized draft of money from my credit card, I checked my other bank statements and realized there are also other duplicated charges. Out of all the money charged, I was only supposed to pay ~$200 (my $99 deposit went into paying a part of this) which I authorized. So the extra charges wrongfully billed is fraud, violation of implied contract, and taking of personal property. 

Within that bogus amount, $770 for bogus holes (77 holes). I had fixed all the holes visible to me upon move out. I'm sure there were NOT 77 holes, and the staff who did the move out inspection confirmed verbally. 

**QUESTION 1:**

Which, if any or if any combination, of these reasons is better in my defense?

1. I had fixed all the holes visible to me (proof of maintenance requests) and there are definitely not 77 holes.
2. Do not mention the holes and just emphasize that the walls did not have any visible damages (proof of panoramic images I took when advertising for lease takeover).

**QUESTION 2:**

Would apartment companies think this money is worth their time, or will they just mediate so I will settle for some of that $1100? 



**QUESTION 3:**

The online portal which they use to collect payment for rent and utilities have 2 methods of payments. 1 way is to save the payment method for future payment (but I did not have to sign an autopay agreement), and another way is to manually click the pay ""button"". So technically, I did not sign anything authorizing them to pay nor click any button to pay.

Considering it’s ambiguous whether using their online paying system means giving authorization, what wrongdoings are their actions still considered of? 

**QUESTION 4:**

How should I argue for unauthorized charges that encompassed some authorized amount?

- Beg of March 2020 (20 days after moving out) They sent me a 2nd move out bill which included charges more than the 1st move out bill (verbally mutually agreed on the 1st move out bill during move out inspection).
- Beg of April 2020 I never signed the 2nd move out bill, but bank directly pulled from my credit card which was previously stored in their payment portal $370
- End of April 2020 I told my credit card company to block further charges.
- Beg of May 2020 got 2nd charge of $770, told my credit card company it's the same charge but for different amount and asked them to reverse it.
- Aug 2020 I realized that my credit card company didn't do anything about the charges, and appealed and since have not heard back. I assume it's because they assumed that I authorized the entire amount.

p.s. This is almost 3 years ago and the staff of the apartment (whom I interacted with) I'm suing have already left. I noticed before and notified my bank during COVID peak when this happened. They told me to work it out with the recipient of the money, but the recipient ignored me. I also got sick so I was only recently able to circle back to this problem. I am indeed trying to defend myself which is why I am desperate for help right now. I have not encountered something like this before. According to https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=4.16.080, the statute of limitation for fraud and expressed contracts is limited to 3 years in the state of Washington where this incident took place. This means I have only have till end of this month.

I've hired a private attorney and paid a retainer. My case has been open for over 7 months. In that time I've had two brief phone conversations with my lawyer. He said the best way to reach him is by text but he rarely responds.

In one of those phone conversations he casually told me that I could probably expect to be convicted on all charges because the prosecution doesn't usually like to negotiate and there's not much he can do. This is pre-indictment and not all evidence has been received nor has there been any plea deal offered.

My lawyer seems to be professionally respected and when I've called other firms, they seem surprised I'd consider looking for someone else.

273,Informally evicted by assisted living,11v5790,"I (36) live in a group home and am female. 

In my group home there are 4 rooms, two upstairs and two downstairs. Two guys live upstairs which is fine, and the understanding was always that the room downstairs was for another female. Whoever moved in was always female and we’d share a bathroom. Well, a month ago the manager let’s call F, she unexpectedly moved a male in next to me. This is triggering to me and I express to F that I don’t feel safe even though the client seems fine. I have trouble sleeping because I’m fearful that the client will break into my room even though I logically understand he won’t. 

So finally after talking with my support people (who were upset F moved a male directly next to me given the entire reason for my being in a group home was ptsd around men) I decided to get on a waitlist for a supportive housing apartment, where I’d be alone with mental health support. Basically a group home but it’s an apartment and more privacy.  The waitlist is “a couple or few months out”. I tell F. She’s heart broken - I was her favorite client as she’s said over the past 2 years. She tries to convince me to stay. Move upstairs next to a diff client. Etc. 

Anyway, now that I’ve officially told her I’m moving, she wants me to move out early, before I come up on the waitlist. She says she has a person for my room, then denies having said that. She’s using things I said 6 months ago against me saying being here is bad for me. She literally wants me to move out to wait to move into the apartment. 

I always was weary around her - I’ve seen her fuck over clients before. I was hoping it wouldn’t be me. She keeps saying what if the waitlist is longer than a few months. I keep reminding her her responsibility is to me first, not a prospective client but she’s playing it like she’s doing it for me when she’s never, ever brought up me leaving. 

Is there a way to stop her from forcing me to leave when I’ve had no bad behaviors and I’m paid up on rent? And she just wants someone in who’s going to stay and isn’t willing to wait for me to move?",12121blah,4,0,0.13

275,Transferring Car Title,11v50tx,"Hi,

I live in Michigan, US.

About 8 months ago I had my mother sign away her car title to me. Everything was set and I believe all I had to do was go to the SOS office and boom I would have ownership of the car. It was a gift to some degree, but there was a money transfer for the car that was not documented. Of course with my jam-packed busy schedule, I never got around to it and it got lost. Me and my wife have turned our house upside down for the last month trying to find it to no avail. My mom's license plate sticker is expiring next month and I can not update it due to me not having ownership of the car, at least to my knowledge that is how it works. Regardless I can not sell the car without the title, obviously, if I wished to in the future. The car is not registered to my address either. I do insure the car under my address, which she does not pay for. Also, if she wanted to, I believe she could take the car at anytime.

 This would all be an easy fix to replace the title but we are not on speaking terms. IF I could get her to help me out and not screw me over, how would I do it? I have done some research, could she appoint me as her agent to sign off for her to replace the title? It would be in her name still, but then we could go through the process of signing it off to me like it was done prior, correct?

I would like to include her as little as possible so any information would be helpful, thank you!",MetallicMatte,1,1,1.0
276,My vehicle was dinged by a car door at Walmart.,11v4iv2,"I purchased a new 2022 Traverse about 8 months ago.  It currently has 7,800 miles on it.  While at a Walmart recently, my daughter and I went shopping and my wife stayed in the vehicle.  A few minutes later, my wife calls me and said someone pulled in next to us, flung open their door, and hit out vehicle.  I tell her to look for damage, take pictures, and get the plate number.  

A moment later, the people come out and my wife tries to talk to them.  Instead, they jump into their vehicle and speed away.  My daughter and I arrived shortly after.  I pulled up the dash camera footage(Viofo A129 Pro Duo 4k) and clearly see the impact.  I also took screenshots where you can clearly see the driver.

I go to my local police station and provide them with the video, screenshots, photos of the damage, photos of the damage to the other drivers door edge, and a photo of their license plate.  I ask if they could provide me with contact information for the person.  The officer says he’ll look into it and let me know.  

Two weeks later, I stop by requesting an update.  They said the officer created a private property crash report for it.  This was news to me because he said he wasn’t. He would just investigate and provide me with the contact info if he could verify it was her.  They gave me a copy of the report and it has both of our info on it as well as insurance.  

According to the local body shop, it’s about $480 in damage.  I was hoping not to have this on insurance.  $480 is $20 shy of my deductible.  I’m also worried how having a crash report for a door ding will depreciate the vehicle’s overall value.  

What’s my recourse here?  Should I file a claim against her insurance?  Attempt to work it out directly with her? Just forget about it all and swallow the damage cost?  The police clerk claimed that their report doesn’t get sent anywhere.  It’s just for their records.  Sorry if this isn’t the right sub to post about this.  If there’s another sub more appropriate, please let me know and I’ll delete.

281,Lawyers always miss expected deadlines- How long does it take to reach a settlement agreement?,11v44je,"I'm in California.

Okay so I've come to this subreddit before for advice and found it fairly helpful. I'm not sure if this is better for here or the off-topic subreddit but I'm trying here first just in case.  
So for a little bit of background, this case has been ongoing for about four years now. The first year or so my lawyers and victim advocate were really on top of stuff. I had a lot of frequent updates and they seemed to take care of a lot. Once COVID hit a lot of it came to a grinding halt which I expected to a degree, but the past year I've had to do a lot for them and they've lost a lot of my emails, my partner's emails, and had me to try and get a lot of info for them that I legit could not get to.

The more frustrating thing is how often they need to push deadlines or I'm left in the dark for months while expecting something. This is the most recent example but the most frustrating: I was told in November via my VA that they'd be discussing a settlement for my case and it should take a few weeks. I contacted them in January and was told I would hear something in February.   
I heard nothing about a week into February so I contacted them again because I had been having issues getting messages and was worried something didn't go through. Was told there were no updates but I'd hear something about the next steps in mid-February. I actually don't hear anything until the last day of February. Which was good, I got a confirmation of my settlement number and that I would be receiving some final documents to sign and a call to get my bank information and go over the numbers. Someone did call on time and they did get my information, but it's been nearly three weeks and no documents. I got an email yesterday saying that there had been a 'mild delay' in the lawyers looking over the documents and they should be sent in about two weeks. I asked my VA what was happening and she said she doesn't have the details but there was some wording in the contract that made the lawyers uncomfortable and they're revising it over these next two weeks.

Is this normal? Like the wait times. I tried to look up this place for reviews and there aren't a lot out there (maybe ten at most), most are positive but I did find one negative review that explained they weren't worth it. I've never done this before and my dad was the one who set me up with this place.

288,Small Claims Court over Security Deposit,11v36j3,"Hello, I have just moved to California with my partner, B. We moved into a house that a friend, D, has lived in for several years. B and I took over the part of the lease for Emily, who randomly announced she were moving elsewhere with about two weeks notice. If my partner and I hadn't been able to move in immediately afterwards, along with another friend, Dwould have been left with the difference in rent, about $2000. We spoke to Emily before, during, and after the move and since we were taking over her part of the lease, she agreed we could pay her back for her part of the security deposit over time instead of all at once because of the fees we ate to manage it. We've paid for three months now, totalling $200 out of $700.

290,Is it possible to have a non-convicted assault charge removed from a background check? (WA state),11v314h,"Back in 2016, a month after turning 18 years old, I was arrested on an assault charge. My mother was physically and emotionally abusive all my life. I’ve been punched in the face, thrown to the floor, shoved down the stairs, and shoved out of a moving car. After turning 18, she started charging me hundreds of dollars in rent. Since she wanted to treat me like a tenant, I informed her that I was no longer interested in being bossed around by her. If she wants to treat me like an adult by charging me rent, she didn’t have the right to boss me around to do her bidding. 

She came into my room one day, demanding that I help her fix her iPad. I said no and told her I was busy. She screamed at me telling me that I was disrespectful, and started pulling out large gallon sized trash bags and throwing all of my belongings in it. I yelled at her to stop, but she continued on. I’m a female and only weighed 80 lbs back then, whereas my mom weighed about 130. I snatched the trash bag full of my stuff out of her hands. I had long nails at the time so they grazed her as I was snatching the bag. She shouted that I assaulted her and said she was calling the police. 

When the police came, I told them what had happened. They asked my mom if she wanted me arrested and she said yes. As I was getting handcuffed, she said she’d change her mind about me being arrested if I apologized. The officers told her that’s not how it works and took me to county jail. I was booked for the night and released the next morning since my mom dropped the charges. I believe the charge was considered as a non-convicted misdemeanor. 

Shortly after that incident, my boyfriend at the time took me in and I never spoke to my mom again. 3 years after the incident, I had submitted a request with the Washington State Patrol to have the misdemeanor deleted. My request was approved and granted. 

However, the arrest still appears on my background check. I’ve been unable to signup to do delivery jobs such as Postmates, Instacart, and UberEats. Even though it has been 7 years since the incident took place and I’ve had no trouble with the law since, I’m still denied delivery jobs because of it. I thought that having it deleted from the Washington State Patrol database would be enough, but I guess I’m not understanding where information is pulled for background checks. 

Is there any possible way for this to be removed or sealed? It feels horrible that I’m seen as a risk, all because I wanted to standup to my abusive mother for once.

291,Damage to property that requires me to fix my damage before the damager fixes theirs?????,11v2yf2,"True scenario: The City installs a sidewalk that requires its contractors to cut everyone’s in-ground sprinkler lines. The City says it will repair the damages by caping off the exposed ends of the lines with new sprinkler heads. 

So far, so good, right?

The issue: When the City contractors show up at my door to fix my lines, they tell me they need to turn on my sprinkler system so they can locate all the cut lines they buried and to see if it is working properly with no leaks. 

I inform them that the system is inoperable, and has been since. Moved in two years ago. When the previous owners installed a swimming pool, they did not pay to have the sprinkler system redone properly, so they just shut it down and left it with problems such as a main timer box that is long dead and won’t power up, a huge leak that is coming from underneath the pool equipment, old and damaged back-flow preventer, a main valve that we can’t locate and that I suspect was probably destroyed when the pool equipment was added (probably why there’s a huge leak), etc. 

The contractors insist that I need to fix all of those issues in order for them to fix the damage they caused, and their subcontractor is saying that I can pay him to fix my part of the damage so that he can then fix the city’s damage at their expense. 

I did not plan on sinking hundreds of dollars into this right now, but if I don’t, the city isn’t going to repair their damages.

292,Medical Malpractice / Fuddled healthcare turns injury into chronic illness.,11v2xuw,"I am wondering if anyone has any information or experience in medical malpractice lawsuits. I am interested in pursuing one and first wanted to check in here before trying to talk to lawyers by phone.

Initial injury: broken left acetabulum, non-displaced fracture. Treated for such, was on crutches when sent home from hospital

Unfound injuries from initial incident: six herniated discs in the upper thoracic, one herniated disc in the neck and multiple bulged discs in the thoracic and cervical spine. Even though I said that my back hurt the day I was in the emergency room, the doctor poked my back, and I didn’t exclaim enough for him so he did not check my back.

Issue: This was a whole body accident where I stated I hit my back, said it hurt, and complained about my back to multiple doctors and ers and they did not want to check it. They though my pain was just from my pelvic fracture. 

There were several incidences where acute pain in legs, back, abdomin, and everywhere sent me to the ER. Eventually parts of me started falling asleep, being excruciating, and having stinging nerve pain. 

This was all basically ignored by two hospitals and their affiliated doctors in the same region in a period of six months post injury. FINALLY, a doctor outside of this system thought to look at my upper back and neck and brain which had not been checked the day of the accident - despite me saying I landed on my entire back and neck. Now, I was in denial about hitting my head, so I said I didn’t hit it, but really I did, I just didn’t feel it because everything happened so fast and I was wearing a helmet.

Fast forward almost two years and I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia with an onset of this injury. I am basically extremely limited in what I can do because I did not properly heal from my injuries because THEY WERE UNFOUNDED for six(thoracic) and eight months(cervical).

Now I believe I have to prove they caused this, not that I just would have ended up with it anyway. My argument and firm belief based on my experience is that because I did not know about the herniated discs in my back and neck, was put on crutches on those herniated discs, was advised, I could lift things on herniated discs that we were unaware of, did things when I returned back to work that I would not have done had I known that I had a back injury, I stated that I had nerve pain from the very beginning in my upper back/mid back. This was ignored by multiple doctors despite my worsening symptoms.

From my research, I can see that when doctors do not find nerve issues in the pelvic MRI and the lumbar MRI, that they are supposed to then look further up the spine for issues radiating down. Also the fact that they did not check my entire spine after the kind of injury that I had is just asinine!!

Does anyone have any advice or info on this? 

I believe I ended up with an incurable painful syndrome at 34 years old because my back was not treated properly and found at the initial accident. I could have healed those injuries before doing the things I did. And I guarantee you that they would never have put me on crutches if they had known that I had herniated discs up there. They would’ve given me a walker.

In one of our building's, a tenant overflowed her bathtub, through her own negligence, causing damage to the two units below her.

The owner of one of the units is our previous property manager, who was fired a few months ago due to corruption, sent a text saying the damage is more than $5,000 and he wants us to file a claim with the association master policy that has a $5,000 deductable.

I think he wants to get paid twice, what should we do? Can he just file a claim without the boards notice?

296,[CA] Requesting holding deposit for an Apt Unit I never received.,11v2gkg,"Hello,

I have a legal advice question regarding my situation. I am a Section 8 client who applied for an apartment in LA back in December 2022. The unit was supposed to be ready on January 13th, but there have been issues with the inspection and leasing process. Section 8 inspectors reached out to the leasing office to schedule an inspection appointment, but there was a miscommunication about the inspection date (the leasing office claimed the unit was inspected by Section 8 when it was not).

I later found out the leasing office informed me that the original unit I had applied for was no longer available due to the current tenant deciding to stay, despite my legal holding deposit on the unit. They offered me another unit, which I agreed to, but it failed the Section 8 inspection due to needing necessary repairs (despite the leasing office telling me prior to agreeing that it was ready for inspection).

We are currently in March 2023 and I am now considering looking for another apartment complex for leasing and would like to request a refund of my application fee and holding deposit (total cost $348). Since I have not moved in and did not sign a lease, am I within my legal right to request my deposit back? If necessary, would taking the leasing office to small claims court be an option?

297,Do I need to keep in contact with person I crashed?,11v2e6p,"About 3 weeks ago I crashed into the back of this woman’s truck, it was very very minor. she had new furniture in boxes and was claiming that i’d have to pay her if anything was broken. police never showed up and she was told to make a police report which i’m not sure she ever did because i never received a call from a police station. 

I admitted fault to my insurance (progressive) and they said they’d take of it. I even brought up what she told me about the furniture and the rep said he’d ask her about it and they’d investigate and pay if there was any damage. so that was that, progressive was taking care of it. 

recently checked the claim status and it says they’re paying for their back truck door by giving them a check and the case is now closed. today, i’ve received 8 missed calls from this lady. 8!!!!

I had taken a nap and put my phone on do not disturb. She keeps calling and calling but not leaving any sort of voicemail or even a text. which we had texted at the time of the accident to switch insurances so not sure why she can’t text me what she wants. I have a feeling it’s something with her furniture which not sure why she didn’t include it in the claim. 

i’m basically here to ask, do I need to keep in contact with her? do I have to answer her call? I could block her but she has my address. I live with my mom and if she goes and i’m not home, my mom would most likely answer the door. she keeps calling and calling and it’s stressing me out.


edit: turns out she did submit the furniture as part of the claim but i’m guessing they denied it, not sure why but i’m guessing because there was no damage. is it legal for her to go after me go pay for it since insurance denied it? can she go to my house to ask for money?",honeybvbymom,4,1,0.67

My manager has been informed of my scheduling restrictions since I started at this store.

In this conversation, he said ""I know you don't like it here, that's why you called HR, right""? and ""If you can get someone else to take you, I'll sign off on it"". Every time he talks to me, it's in an incredibly condescending tone. There's been nothing but problems since I was FORCED to transfer to this store, and I feel like the management is trying to make me miserable enough to quit.

Manager has been informed of scheduling restrictions for months, and specifically schedules me for those hours. This is not legally relevant, but contextually.

I’m an alcoholic. Last year, I got sober with the help of AA from February - October), for the first the, but unfortunately have been back out since...

Some background on what I’m facing:

I was really hoping and expecting for a bonus this year, but I was caught off guard by a less than ideal performance review last week—- no bonus or salary increase. I needed that, and have just spiraled into a deep depression/drinking heavily this past week. 

I took some personal days (Thursday/Friday off (I’m allotted some that can be used on short notice.) off course I blacked out and drank heavily, texted my boss some pretty rude messages—I believe he knows I have a problem/ he probably saw the difference.

I sent him another text to apologize Friday morning, and that I haven’t been in a good place mentally, and that I will be seeing a therapist through EAP. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few months ago, and on medications for it

I plan on calling first thing Monday to apologize,and explain a plan of action to get sober, work a program, and seek medical help. I’m so embarrassed and afraid—heart is pounding out of my chest. 

Any advice on how to handle this?

In under 24 hours, I was approved and was immediately sent a lease to sign (had an expiration of 24 hours). After reading the lease, I found I would be responsible for a few things that were not disclosed to me prior to applying, which were deal breakers. I went back and re-read the application to make sure they were not mentioned there (they weren't), but did come across this clause (which I overlooked, and initialed):

> I acknowledge and agree that the first month's rent is freely given to the owner and/or owner's agent in consideration of the owner's act of removing the premises from the real estate rental market in reliance on this application to lease, after the application has been approved. Therefore, I agree that if I fail or refuse, for any reason whatsoever to follow through with the Lease Terms of the above-described property, I understand and agree that the owner will retain the full amount of the first month's rent ($XXXX) as liquidated damages, which I freely acknowledge is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable expectation of damages which owner incurred as a result of temporarily removing the premises from the real estate rental market and attempting to find another party to lease the premises.

Am I reading this right? That the landlord can charge me the equivalent of first month's rent for simply refusing to sign the lease?

311,My upstairs neighbor wants my apartment and is messing with my electricity,11v0yfo,"For context, I (25F) live with my (65F) mother in California in a studio apartment with an electrician upstairs neighbor who wants to have our apartment because it is insanely cheap. 

Things that have happened so far: 

A few months ago noisy neighbors moved into the unit above mine which cause me to complain to property management because I almost got into a car accident one morning due to the lack of sleep my noisy neighbors caused. Even with video evidence of the noise, property management didn’t do anything because the neighbors claimed their kids are making the noise and they can’t control them. 

Prior to this my entire kitchen cabinet came crashing down after they were dropping heavy items on their floor/ my kitchen ceiling. Again, nothing was done to the upstairs neighbors. They just fixed the cabinet and called it a day. 

The couple upstairs is very violent and they have kids in the apt. One day the violence got to the point that we had to call the cops. While we stayed anonymous, the neighbor said he knew it was us and that he had to talk his way out of getting arrested. This when everything went down hill. 

When we confronted him about the continuous loud noise he admitted to wanting our apartment because he said he figured out how much we pay in rent and that he has previously moved 4 times in our complex so he knows it won’t be a problem. He said the only solution he saw to end this situation was to have have my mother and I speak to the property management and ask to switch apartments with him so he can be on the ground floor. The property management said he had put in a request to move into a floor level unit but none were currently available (which is bullshit bc we’ve had two families move into two floor level apartments. 

This is where things get weird. After this interaction with him we started to hear scrapping and sawing in the middle of the night proceeded by the sound of metal into our walls from upstairs. Shortly after this we started to hear a loud buzzing noise come from our walls. It was the sound of electrical currents. We had an electrician come in and he said we had uneven voltage through the apartment and that the overload of electricity can start a fire if it overloads and there are crossed wires or corroded wires. along with the noise our air conditioning system would randomly turn on and off. Along with that our fridge started to over heat at times or not get enough energy and would turn off as well (this is critical because I am on medication that has to be refrigerated and I can’t afford to have it be spoiled for a faulty fridge. 

Along with the electric problems my mother and I noticed that whenever we would pull out our phones to record the loud banging it would stop and as soon as the phone was put away they would continue. I’d move from the kitchen area to the living room and the noise would follow. When we’d leave the apartment we’d come home to items being thrown at our front door like piss. So my mother and I decided to get a front door camera and one day a rock was thrown at our door and the camera was conveniently down but when I chased after the person in the stair well I saw my neighbor running up the stairs. (I know this sounds crazy and the thought of him having cameras in the home sound crazy but my mother and I had to vacate the apartment for a few days while there was a city inspection bc the studio is not approved as a studio but a gym turned into a storage space and the locks are flimsy so we think it is possible) 


We still deal with the loud electrical and high voltage everyday and now there has been what spectrum calls “a signal interference” which causes our security system to go offline. My mother said she is dealing with constant headaches and dizziness since we started to deal with the high voltage in our apartment. 

He is an unlicensed electrician with his own company and he has all the tools he would need to keep this going… 

We have gone to the cops two times now and they said this was an issue for the landlord and the property management but they don’t seem to care and either don’t respond to my emails/ texts or give me the run around.

So I'm currently going through a divorce (26M) in Illinois with one child (2F).

This whole process has been hard as my ex-wife filed an OP against me to keep me away from my daughter as a power move. She used this time to steal all of my cash, a joint tax return, and racked up all utilities that were in my name. I was a stay-at-home dad (in charge of all four of her kids and her sister's 3 year old) and a full time student when she kicked me out of the house, so I was homeless, unemployed, and in massive debt with no funds.

It took about four months before I got the OP dismissed, at which point her lawyer quit halfway through a court date after reviewing all the evidence I had proving she was full of shit.

At which point, I negotiated 50% visitation, joint custody, and we split all medical, education, and extracurricular bills. We even split the child tax credit.

Now in a couple of weeks, we have financial court... I am coming after her for $16,000 (her half of debt that I was straddled with, half the tax return she ran off with, and equity in the house we bought). She countered and asked for child support.

This is where I need advice... She claimed she made $53,000 (I make $58,000) and my lawyer was under the impression I'd pay max $40/mo...

Except here's the problem, she about her income so she only made $17.50/hour working 40 hours a week. So my child support obligation goes up. Then I found out yesterday she either quit or was fired from her job, and I'm worried about what that'll do to my child support obligation.

I can barely make ends meet right now as I'm paying for my bills, my daughters insurance, marital debt, and lawyer debt. I make too much for state assistance (she claims me and three of her kids for LINK), and her house payment is 2/3rds of my rent.

When I do the calculator with her making no money, it says I'll owe around $600 and I don't know what to do. This woman has destroyed every ounce of my being, ripped me away from my child, left me in the streets with nothing, and I'm freaking the fuck out.",EmperorValEmbershade,4,1,0.67

320,20k was taken from my bank relating to a court levy from a case that does not pertain to me. Cant get it back.,11uzyq3,"  

About a month ago I loged into my bank account and realized that all of my money was gone (**20k dollars**  were withdrawn without my knowledge or consent from my bank account) Shocked, I contacted my bank and they informed  me that I was served a Levy by Child Support Services from the state of California. 

Having no children I was surprised and in great distress. I posited as possibilities that I have been subject of identity theft, miss identification or something of the sort. 

The legal department of the bank´s customer service provided me with the phone number regarding some agency relating to the state of California with whom I was able to dig up some information. 1) The participant number relating to this levy 2) The social workers who are overseeing this case in the span of two (Stanislaus and Merced) and even 3)the name of the mother who received the money.

After talking with the social workers I learnt that the total money sought by the levy amounts $101,044. 07 (which If I had had on my bank account they would have surely removed it). I was then redirected with the person involved in their department who handles “this sort of cases”. She requested further information from me in order to complete their internal profile and to un-link me from this particular case. She promised to talk with some people from the state in order to try to resolve this.

Fast forward a month they told me that after talking with the people from the state of California and after them reviewing my case, there was nothing that could be done to get the money back. The reason mentioned was that I did not take action within the first 10 days since the bank have sent a letter. However, I do not live on that address, actually I like outside of the country, so there was no way in which I could have seen the letter. And even now, that I had the mailbox checked such letter is not on there. The people from the child support services said that since that 10 day period is over, there is nothing that I could do to claim the money and that “their hands were tied”.

The only posibiliti, that they vaguely mentioned is that if the person who received the money would return it. However they also said that they are unshure if it its even allowed to tell the person that that money had been wrongfully allocated to them. But this leaves me wondering, what would happen if they do identify the person who owned that money, would she be left, at the end of the day, double of what was assigned in the court case?

They also suggested me to talk to my bank. Which I did and they explained that they have no choice but to follow the instructions given by the court in question according to the some family code  **family code sc 17530 section c** (I have not verified this, and even unsure that I have written this correctly).

Having no positive answer from the bank nor the agency, I don’t know who to turn. I have no experience with the U. S. legal system and unsure how to proceed. What document should I gather? What kind of lawyer should I approach and so on… 

Mind you, that during this time, I have not been able to realize any payments since they took all of my money, and the fees are going to start to add up. Additionally, well I need that money to complete some transactions, and well cover my expenses, so there is a sense of urgency. And I´m wasting all this time dealing with these. I would also like to receive some sort of compensation for this. 

It´s incredible for me that this sort of things can happen. Life saving can just vanished in an instant and one be locked away from them since I did not check my mailbox or bank account within 10 days…

322,Can my doctor refuse to refill my prescription if test positive for weed?,11uzv3u,"I asked this is r/AskDocs as well but wasn’t sure if it was more legal or medical lol. Kind of both I guess?

So I was diagnosed with ADHD and started on Concerta a little over a month ago. I was told that I would be subjected to random drug testing, which makes sense to make sure I’m actually taking it. However, I was told that if it comes back positive for weed that I would not be able to get my prescription anymore. I live in a state where it is recreationally legal. Is my doctor actually allowed to do that? How is it really any different from having a drink? I was not told I can’t drink alcohol, which I would think would be more of an issue… I enjoy smoking every now and then, just like having a drink. It’s fun. Why is that so bad?
My doctor said it’s also company policy. So can I just be refused from being able to see any doctor there if they do find weed in my system? I also have a PCP that I see through them. I just don’t see how that would be right. Isn’t there something about “duty/continuity of care”?

Myself and the car behind me were trying to merge left onto the highway and he hit me. However, since the damage was to my rear left bumper and his front passenger bumper, the cop gave me the ticket for illegal lane change and failure to yield right of way.

His lawyer sent an affidavit to my insurance company to fill out to declare I wasn't on work duty at the time of accident and that I don't have any other liability coverage, and they're also asking me to give them a list of my assets and liabilities. In the documents, it states that completing the assets affidavit is not a condition to settle the claim, but will ""release your insured by release or otherwise"" (idk what this means). Is filling out the assets and liabilities just a formality? What happens if I don't want to give this information?

328,Floors ruined due to incorrect installation. What are my options?,11uz868,"About two years ago, I bought a house and paid over $70k to a contracting company to renovate. The work included removing popcorn ceilings, installing hardwood floors throughout (1700 sq ft), and renovating the kitchen (new cabinetry, backsplash, lighting). There were LOTS of problems during the work and it was never really up to standards when they finally “finished.” One of the biggest points of contention was that the contract I signed specified that the hardwood floors would be installed with a floor glue, and it became clear they had not glued the flooring when it was installed. At the time we finished, they assured me that there were two methods for installation and that my flooring was properly installed. I had posted a negative review publicly during the time they were working because I had been unable to even reach them to get them to come finish the work. They basically came back an extorted me, saying that somehow I owed them $3000 and they would collect it if I didn’t remove my review and sign an agreement not to talk about this company. I was so beaten down at that point that I did it and tried to just move on.

Fast forward a year, and my floors start shifting. Big gaps appearing between boards all over the house. I tried to reach out to the company about this but go no response. Last night, my faucet leaked and caused water to run down onto the floors (probably a couple gallons of water). As I started to sop up the water, I saw that it was under the flooring, so that if I stepped on them, water bubbles up through the cracks. I did my best to dry and air out the area, but this morning the boards are bowed and uneven. 

I am so angry at the contractors and at myself for not fighting them harder. My contract had a six month warranty which has expired, but I am hoping that because they broke the contract by not installing the floor with glue that I may have legal grounds to recoup the cost of the flooring.

Friend has paid rent on time each month, via personal check (at landlord's request) for the entirety of his tenancy - about 4-5 years total.

Landlord is quite elderly, and he wonders whether her cognitive state my be causing this.

Is there any time limit the landlord has for cashing these checks? Is there any point at which the friend no longer owes rent the landlord is essentially refusing to collect? Is there anything more he should be doing other than continuing to contact the landlord and ensuring the pending amount is available in checking? This is in Pennsylvania, USA.

344,Kitchen Remodeling Issues- How to go About This?,11uxwg6," 

If there is somewhere else I should ask, please redirect.

In early October, we signed a contract with a kitchen renovation company with a deposit give totaling half the total cost of renovations. Six weeks later, final measurements were taken, materials were picked, and we were advised we’d get a call regarding a start date. With the holiday season in full swing at that time, we didn’t hear from anyone. We weren’t concerned at this point because again, it was the holidays and we live in an area where literally everything seems to be slower during the holidays. I mean, urgent care facilities were even closed for weeks.

On January 2nd, I reached out to the employee who we signed the contract with and he informed me the scheduler would get in touch with me. She did, and promised a start date would be provided by 1/6. I didn’t hear from here and reached out the following Tuesday, 1/10. At first I had sent her a text, then I called the office (kept ringing, no VM option) and then I emailed our initial contact again; this is when I received a text from the scheduler stating she was home sick with her child and that they were short staffed but she promised to get me a date by the end of the week, 1/13.

I am a mom of an often sick toddler so I sympathized, sent well wishes and went about my day. I did not hear from her on 1/13 and decided to reach out again on 1/16. I called the office to no avail. I text the scheduler again to which I was informed that they had Covid but are currently on the mend and that she PROMISED we’d have a start date by close of business that day, 1/16. After almost another week of going back and forth via email, we were given a new start date of March 6th, which was a month and a half after our initial start date of mid-January, which we were given verbally.

On February 17th, we reached out again this time regarding a question about the installation of our new stove. The did not answer the email until ten days later, which required me following up with them twice. They sent someone out on March 1st to assess and final plans on the stove and cabinet height were made. We asked once again for confirmation on the 3/6 start date, to which we were told that, unfortunately due to being short staffed and work on a prior project not being completed, that our kitchen work would not start on 3/14. 

On Monday, 3/13, I had emailed the point of contact asking for a start time. She emailed me back a screen shot of an email she had sent me on Sunday, 3/12. Shockingly, this had gone to spam despite how much we had been communicating. The email informed us of the same thing we have been hearing: they are short staffed, the previous project is taking too long and we have to push **our** start date back **again.** The same email stated that she was to send us an update on 3/13, which she never did. We responded and expressed our extreme disappointment is their lack of follow-up, in the fact that it's always us reaching out to them, and stressed that we have several other home renovation projects that are being held up due to this. We did not ask for our money back, but instead maybe some money off the project considering what a nightmare this has been. 

As of this writing, we have not heard back from them and truthfully, I know we won't unless we reach out to them again. What should we do here? To add, I'm pregnant with several complications already happening, and I truly do not need the added stress. Further, I would love to have this sort of work done before the baby gets here.

I am a university student who was arrested and ""charged"" with a felony at first by the university police. Without my attorney doing anything at all, the charge was immediately remanded down to the municipal court as a disorderly person charge. My question relates more to the legal language. 

I understand I need to contact a lawyer who specializes in the securities industry and FINRA arbitrations in the future but on a lawyer's website, it says depending on the state an officer's charge is not the same as what the prosecutor brings upon you in court officially. 

What you are read in court / the prosecutor brings upon you in court is your ""official"" and formal charge. So if asked if I have been ""charged"" with a felony, would I answer yes or no?  I personally believe I would answer **no**. This is because while the arresting officer's summons claims it is a 4th-degree charge (felony), the prosecutor immediately remanded it down to a disorderly person charge meaning I was formally charged with a misdemeanor.

352,Tenant Rights - California - Deposit - Retaliatory Landlords,11uwx9r,"My housemates and I live in California. Our landlords gave a previous tenant their full deposit back and a letter of recommendation upon moving out, the landlords were given verbal notice and text message notice of this tenant vacating prior to me moving into the residence and signing a lease. Similar to the last tenant that moved out, the landlords were given over 30 days text notice when I was planing on moving out before my other housemates. The other tenants were originally planning on filling that room, then decided that they were going to move out instead.. I had not received my deposit by the time my other housemates decided to move, which was over 21 days after I moved out, and my prior landlords are now claiming that they do not owe me my deposit until 21 days after my other housemates move out. The landlords are now claiming that text is not sufficient and that they will be withholding my deposit until the 21-day period after my other housemates vacated the premises. It has not been 21 days yet, and they are claiming to still be going through the ""discovery period"" as they themselves move back into the residence after not living there for 15+ years. Collectively my housemates and I lived there for 3 years, there were prior renters to any of us living in that house. They have stated that they will be withholding some of the deposit and producing receipts by next week. I believe they will be withholding the deposit because there was a mouse that they alerted us to when they replaced an appliance in the home, but they never took care of the mouse and replaced the appliance knowing that there was a mouse living behind that area. We as tenants did our best to try and eradicate the mouse, but not before it ate through a wire and the appliance broke again. The landlords stated in a walk through with my housemates that they would be charging us, the tenants, for a new dishwasher as we were unable to catch the mouse. However, landlords are responsible for eradicating pests, and this would constitute uninhabitable living conditions. Our home was always clean and our landlords would often remark at how clean it was when they needed to come and repair something. Additionally, while living there the wiring that they had previously done themselves stopped working and the entire electrical panel needed to be replaced. We did not have power in 2 rooms, the hallway, or the bathrooms for over maybe 3+ weeks, while the tried to figure out what was going on. They never compensated or reduced our rent when we did not have electricity in multiple areas of the house. Withholding the deposit and claiming we owe them for the dishwasher (and who knows what else?) seems like retaliatory behavior. It seems like they are trying to find anything they can because they are the ones moving back into the house now.  They also gave the previous tenant that moved out their entire deposit back. Note, I lived in this house for less than 6-months and the house is in the same condition, if not better, as when I moved in.

It could have serious ramifications if this blows up and “Corey” finds this post. l am going to keep things as vague as possible to prevent any chance at identification. Names are fake. This is not a joke or bait post. Please help. 

This story involves my friend Anna, my friend Beatrice, and Anna’s ex boyfriend, Corey. The crime took place in New York state.

Anna and Corey dated for many years before the incident I’m about to mention. Corey confessed to Anna that he had committed a sex crime against a family member, who is a minor and lives in his household. He admitted that his parents knew of the crime and were protecting him. Anna broke it off with him and told Beatrice, who in turn told me. Since this incident, Corey has continued to harass both Anna and Beatrice, as Beatrice is the person to whom Anna is closest. Despite them blocking him on all socials, he has made alternative accounts to continue to harass them, and he has also reached out to many of Anna’s loved ones in an attempt to get Anna to contact him again. 

We have no proof that Corey committed this crime other than text messages in which he references it. It is Anna’s word against his, and his own parents, who DO have the evidence, are attempting to keep this hush hush. We are afraid that if the child stays in the family’s care that he will continue to abuse her. How do we report this? To whom do we report it? Can Anna get a restraining order if need be? We are afraid of him. He is physically much larger than any of us, and he has been cruel to Anna in the past. This is serious, and ongoing. It could mean life or death for the people involved because this guy is literally unhinged.

I bought my first home back in June 2021. The person who sold the house to me owned it from 2013 through 2021. One thing that was mentioned on the seller's disclosure was that the PREVIOUS owner (prior to 2013) had disclosed that there was some termite damage in the basement.

Before I bought the house, this was the one thing that made me almost back out. It wasn't until after having an inspector come and a licensed pest control company come to confirm that:

1. There was only one termite shelter tube.
2. There was slight damage to one piece of wood under the basement stairs.
3. There was no other signs of damage anywhere in the basement or throughout the house.
4. There were no signs of an active infestation.

With this all in mind, I went through and purchased the house.

I've been here almost two years and no issues on this front. This termite damage could have been from 10/20/30/40 years ago. My question is that when I'm ready to sell my house, do I need to continue the chain of disclosures? I don't want to hurt my chances of finding a buyer over this non-issue.

357,Can this be a case for seeking unpaid wages?,11uwe1z,"Located in NYC (first time poster on behalf of my partner).

 My partner's family had formerly operated a family restaurant business (LLC) with a family friend who was a co-owner, while my partner and his mom were regular employees (did not have their names tied to the LLC).

The restaurant had a crappy location and only survived from September 2022 to December 2022. Suffice to say the one co owner was not happy with how slow the business was becoming, so he closed the doors and my partner and his mother were jobless. 

I don't believe that my partner can claim unemployment due to having only worked for 3 months and had not maintained continuous employment for the last 18 months (the last jobs he had was where he left voluntarily and he has gaps in employment the last 18 months). 

He has also discussed with his mother about attempting to collect unpaid wages from the co owner. There are a few things to note:

-the business did not have a lot or enough money to pay him or his mom due to breaking even and not having enough profits
-there was no W2 or paystub/payroll established. Anything that was earned went back into the restaurant. The only money my partner and his mom could bring home was from the tip jar, which the co owner would try to claim as his own despite not being a regular employee. 
-his mom and him did not have employment contracts, only received verbal agreements on a starting wage of 15/hour (NYS minimum wage) and a few text message exchanges. 

From the three months time in which the business was operating he worked around 50-60 hours per week. While they didn't have a proper time clock he was told to write down his hours and give them to the owner every week. He has reached out to the co owner asking about getting paid for his time worked but the co owner said he wasn't responsible for paying the money, and that my partner needed to speak to his dad about it, even though his dad no longer is tied to the LLC. He has tried to speak to the co owner again on the issue but the co owner so far isn't willing to speak further about the topic and has been avoiding him. 

Is my partner and his mom still able to seek out for those 3 months unpaid wages? They are looking to seek legal aid but aren't sure whether they able to file for an unpaid wages claim or have to sue the former co owner in small claims court.

Basically, we entered a 12 month rental agreement that would end in July, and paid a security deposit along with first/last month rent. However, our landlord is now senile and his sons are running the show.

Due to personal circumstances, we need to move before the original 12 month lease expires.

We also have the agreement in writing, where they spelled-out that we would receive our deposit back once the new tenant has signed.

However, the landlord’s son recently implied that we will forfeit the last month’s rent that we prepaid. In doing so, they would effectively be collecting double rent for July—once from the new tenant and again via our last month’s deposit.

366,(WA State) Peculiar rental situation,11uvarw,"So first off, I am contacting the tenant’s union Monday morning.
But I need some questions answered asap.
Here is the situation:
I was fired from my job back in November, and haven’t found one yet. I’m subsisting on what meager revenue I can access through doing Door Dash by foot (my car was repossessed in December, and my e bike was stolen while dashing in February). I was late on rent, and while dashing to get it, I was in a hit and run as the victim.
Anyhow, my landlord was talking about eviction, and I still had another time of being late before he can even think about it.
Out of the frustration, I gave my 30 notice of intent to move. The landlord then offered to pay me to do work around the house so he can sell it, for which I’ve only been given $20. And there is approximately 40 hours of landscaping and exterior work that was done. He also offered to let me stay on, as I have nowhere to go since I can’t find work or get help from anybody.
To further complicate things, my roommate gave his notice as well, but he couldn’t find a new plant yet, so the landlord made him pay rent, without giving him any kind of lease.
The landlord had us move into the basement, so he could have the upstairs professionally cleaned. Now, they want to come in and take pictures. But he is trying to force my roommate to move his belongings. 
Nowhere in this has the landlord made an attempt to pay our deposits back, and it’s 6 weeks past the end of my tenancy. It’s 3 weeks for my roommate.

I recently left Amarillo, TX and moved out of state. I had scheduled the walk through of my duplex for 9 am 2/21/23. At 9 that day, he was at my neighbor's (and his tennant in the house next door's) auto shop but was ""too busy"" to do my walk through. He knew I was leaving the state and happened to be busy the whole day. He told me he would call to discuss a few things, and never did. I contacted him a week later and requested all contact to be via rest or email for my records and requested for a copy of my lease and everything else I may have signed. A quick rundown of how it's gone

-landlord claims I owe him $500 dollars in addition to keeping my deposit for spraying for bedbugs last November. I was never informed I would be paying, how much it would be, never signed any documentation (not even in a lease).

-landlord has sent me pictures of a dusty vent, a dusty ceiling fan, dirty grout in the shower, and a maybe 1"" long 1/8"" tall spot on the corner of trim that is missing paint.  I have pointed out several times that cleaning items do not count against a deposit

-landlord has sent me a picture of a cat I had babysat temporarily. He says I broke the lease, as he had told me no cats. I never signed anything, nor did I know there were not cats allowed

Where it gets a bit iffy is I technically never signed a lease, at least not what I'm used to a lease being. I signed a paper that stated what my rent was, my security deposit, and that I had 2 dogs. Nothing less nothing more.

When I was calling the landlord after he was too busy for the 9am appointment, he did say he was raising my rent as of Feb 12 in an attempt to recoup the losses for the bedbug spraying, but I do not have that in writing.

I have already sent and have confirmation of receiving of my letter of demand

379,"New place I moved to has some leaks and electrical issues, could I be on the hook? (SoCal)",11utk7v,"Southern California/LA

&#x200B;

Moved to a super cute new place in a nice area of town. But the landlord is elderly and the place has been fixed up on the cheap. When I shower, there are leaks. The fridge icemaker sometimes leaks water. And there are visible electrical issues - lights will change in intensity, power will sometimes go out, causing the Internet router etc to reboot. My PC got turned off from this one time while I was home.

&#x200B;

Given how beautiful where it is and the market, I won't find a place at that price elsewhere if I dismiss these 'quirks'.

&#x200B;

My concern though is that if the water was left on the ground when I was out of town, or should something more severe happen - what am I responsible for as a renter?

I have Renters' ins.

I have notified her of some of the leaks, seems pointless to keep mentioning it, except from a documentation standard to protect myself perhaps?

I haven't mentioned electrical issues yet. It's not a huge deal, the lights flicker. The Internet went out 2-3x (it's been a week), my PC shut off once. But I'm concerned about possible more serious things like fire etc. They put electric heaters in the place which has been really nice, but one seems to have.. ""melted""; there is some sort of cable drooping from it now and charred external shielding. I intend to take a pic and let them know this weekend.

&#x200B;

**Could I be on the hook for any of this if not fixed? Collateral damages perhaps? (Water leak and electric issue causing additional damage, ruined floors, etc?)** I don't get the idea that they are looking to keep the place tip top, I more get the idea they are at the end of their reign, without much support, unable to do a lot of the work without subbing out to people who would do substandard job.

I reached out to her sister to find out if they found out who the child father was, and I was told that any of the possible fathers that had been told of were tested and that they were not the fathers, leaving me as possibly the sole untested father.
Now the tricky part, because this has occurred over the course of the years prior to me finding out, the child was placed for adoption and adopted. I tried a lawyer to see if I could find anything out, but they dropped the ball and all I got was “the child is a minor, and has been adopted, the file is sealed, we can’t do anything for you right now.”

We paid them $1k, then once we received the contract, my ex and I never got around to signing it (big mistake, I know).

Flash forward to today and now my ex doesn't want to uphold that contract we verbally agreed / paid the lawyer $1k for. Instead, he's working with a new attorney to offer me $60k ($20k less than what my half of the equity would be in a buyout) if I sign a quitclaim deed. In this offer he also states:
- he will pay me $60k via a HELOC on our house, applied to his credit, once I sign the quitclaim deed
- he will refinance the house once the housing rates drop down to 4%, thus taking me off the mortgage (we split 50/50 closing costs, I forfeit rights to any additional equity)
- he would assume responsibility for all mortgage and escrow payments
- if he defaults payment, the house goes to sale or refi immediately to prevent foreclosure
- in the event of his death, his mother would have the option to negotiate a buyout or sale with me 

I told him I wanted to see the contract (this was all drafted in notes) first before we discussed anything further. This makes me very uneasy, but I want to work things out with him.

Months later I start to reapply around March and got hired with my girlfriend for funpix, we both worked there for about 2-3 months until I decided to transfer to security to help my girlfriend get promoted for funpix since they wouldn’t promote either of us and turns out the moment I transferred she immediately got promoted. 

The only issue was the safety team (security). I’ve heard many complaints about the security team but I just ignored it because I really wanted my gf to get hired and they did get paid a little more than any other department. There are 5 tiers for their department and normally takes months to upgrade to the next tier and I was surprisingly promoted fairly quickly, almost within a month to tier 2. Many of the officers there and higher ups complimented me on how a great worker I was and why they really wanted to move me up because I worked super hard. As a couple months go down as a tier 2 unit it was the worse time I’ve had working for cedar fair. A lot of times they threw me on my own to learn and constantly worked me passed my availability which I’ve had before I started working again for the franchise. My availability consisted of not working on Wednesday and Thursday which they’ve made me work plenty of times and I couldn’t work past 6. 

That did not matter what’s so ever in their case. They forced me to work till 11pm, 12pm, and 1 am. I have made many complaints but would always get ignored till one day they threaten to fire me and/or demote me. It caused me to be stressed and mentally drained especially considering how u understaffed we were, not to mention having only 3-5 security officers walking around an amusement park in the heat watching over 20k+ people while also helping (no offense) the numerous amount of careless parents who lose their children from like 3-14. It was a really stressful job and I wasn’t use to it. 

Aside from what my job responsibilities I was just super stressed on how poorly I was treated by the team and yes I did miss out on a couple of days and showed up late because of the fact I had to leave work at 12-1am and come in the very next morning, ALSO working 13-14 hour shifts with no breaks.

They claimed to have fixed it but must have done a horrible job because my grandmother went to my great Uncles house and noted how her brakes felt soft and then her brakes failed, she had to use the e-brake just to get back to that shop. At the time my uncle also said something about the fitting. My grandma assured me they fixed it but i recently got the car ready for inspection and the mechanic who looked at it noticed the fitting and pointed out almost immediately it was illegal. Then i told my grandmother to call down there and they claimed that my shop only wants to make quick buck on us and that compression fittings are legal and through a little bit of research i found what my mechanic said was true because a car will not pass inspection with a compression fitting.

446,Is there any legal recourse against a school?,11uk0es,"(Texas - public school)

On Feb. 9, 2023, My daughter didn’t get off the school bus after school so I started searching for her. 

I called everyone i knew and we all started looking for her with no luck. 
After an hour of searching I called the school AP (assistant principle) and left a message saying I’m calling the police because I can’t find my daughter and the last place she was at was the school. None of the parents who were at the school for after school activities could find her there either. I thought she may have been kidnapped. I was panicking.

I hung up and just as I was about to call the police the AP called me back saying they had my daughter and that time has slipped by and didn’t realize the time. They said there was an incident at school during PE and I need to come to the school. 

PE is at 2:30pm,  this call was at 5:46pm. Over 3 hours after the incident.

When i arrive at the school I learned that my daughter was in a fight. But the school did not tell me all the facts. 

I asked to see the video of the incident and the admin advised they had not looked at the video yet and there may be no point as there are many blind spots at PE. 

They then tell me that they are arresting my daughter (she’s 12) for assault causing bodily injury as she punched a girl in the face with a lock. 

They said that all the witnesses said my daughter started the fight for no reason.

My daughter told me that all the girls they talked to were the girls who attacked her and were lying.

My daughter had scratch marks, hits and chucks of her hair all over her.

I asked if they had checked my daughter out for injuries or taken any photos of all the marks on her and they said no. So i took her to the bathroom and took photos of everything. 

My daughter was jumped by 15 girls at school. She had been warned by her friends that they had over heard the group of girls planning the attack during PE as there are no video cameras in the locker room and many known blind spots on the field. 

This school is known for not doing anything to stop bullying and my daughter has seen over and over the administrators doing nothing to help the students so she didn’t say anything to the teachers as she thought they wouldn’t help anyways. 

Sure enough when PE started the group of girls started harassing my daughter and my daughter tried to get away from the girls. She walked to the field to run laps and as she walked outside she picked up a lock and put it in her pocket just in case the girls escalated their harassment to physically attacking her as they said they were going to do.

The girls followed her to the field, calling her names and pushing her. 

My daughter tried to get away from them and as she was walking back towards the school the group of girls swarmed her. They push her and she turns and hits one of the girls in the face with the lock and then all the girls start hitting my daughter, kick her in the back, pull chunks of her hair out. 

The PE teacher stops the fight and takes my daughter to the assistant principle saying that my daughter started the fight. 

She did not though, she defended herself against the group of girls.

They had my daughter arrested when it was clearly self defense. 

The video proves it and yet the school is ignoring the video. 

There is a witness statement confirming what my daughter said happened but they ignored that as well.

Two of the girls who attacked my daughter admitted with written statements that they intended to beat my daughter up and was harassing her but they’ve ignored this as well.

Nothing has happened to the girls who attacked my daughter. 

My daughter though was arrested, suspended for three days, been in ISS for over a month and now they are trying to send her to an alternative school for kids they consider dangerous. 

My daughter has never been in trouble. Never had any disciplinary actions, she’s a good kid who only tries to defend herself against these girls.

I know it was 15 because i counted them in the video. 

The school says there is nothing I can do.  They have immunity and can take any disciplinary action they want. 

My daughter is depressed after this incident, can’t sleep, angry that she is being punished for defending herself while the girls who attacked her were let off without any discipline action at all.  

And to make matters worse, these girls are spreading lies about her at the school saying my daughter attacked them with a knife.

I told the arresting officer and school admin the day after the incident that the girls are spreading lies about what happened but they’ve done nothing about it. 

My daughter has been hearing these lies spreading and it’s making her even more depressed. There seems to be absolutely nothing we can do about it.

The girls who attacked my daughter are known bullies as well.

This school has created a bully mentality. The bullies know they won’t get into trouble and that the school won’t take any action against them. Punishing my daughter and not them only reinforced their belief of this.

447,THE JUDGE PRESIDING OVER MY SMALL CLAIMS COURT CASE MADE A MISTAKE! CAN I DO ANYTHING TO HAVE THE COURT RECONSIDER THIS NOW THAT THE CASE IS SETTLED? (NO APPEALS POSSIBLE),11ujfoi,"Please help me! Is there anything I can to correct a judge’s error in my small clams case?

Arizona
Coconino County
Page, AZ

In Page, AZ the Justice of the Peace rules over all small claim cases. In late 2022, the active JoP died suddenly. My case was scheduled for Dec 9th, and a temporary judge was assigned to hear my case (see below for more info about this judge’s qualifications).

My claim was for reimbursement of expenses on a property I was renovating for a friend, and I had $3,660.46 in legitimate receipts to claim reimbursement for. 

Her ruling, issued one month after the trial ended, was a simple judgment statement with the amount noted: $2,556.90 (with no breakdown of how she reached her judgment.) 

I then asked the court clerk to ask the judge to give me a breakdown of how she came up with the judgment total, since her math wasn’t mathing (my claims worksheet was 3 pages long, and yes, complicated... it was an extensive renovation happening over 3 months during the summer of 2021.)

The following is verbatim from her response to my question for a breakdown on her judgment:

“The small claims officer is not required to provide an explanation of the judgment, however regarding the judgment in this case the following was considered:

1. The limit for monetary award in Arizona, for Small Claims action in Justice of the Peace courts, is $3,000. 
2. While much evidence and many documents were provided by both parties regarding labor, materials, and compensation, the claim and documentation for “supplies” expenses totaling $2,556.90 was clearly documented, and undisputed by either party.

3. While evidence of extensive effort on the part of the plaintiff is clear, proof of contractual obligation by the defendant remains less defined, and plaintiff’s claim for reimbursement of labor costs questions the distinction between labor for hire and labor of love.
4. the court determined that the plaintiff was not entitled for rent monies to be returned, as the plaintiff did reside at the property during the time frame in question. The plaintiff was not entitled to a return of a “deposit” as her departure was premature (reference email 9/29/21) per plaintiff’s own verbal commitment, and the distinction of deposit vs. rent accrued is unclear.”

So, I was confused after I got this response. You see, I didn’t ask for a refund of labor. It was discussed in court totally by the defendant as a reason for not paying me for my expenses since I lived there for a time where rent wasn't paid, but I did not sue for it, and he did not countersue for rent.

I also did not ask for rent monies returned. I paid rent, and lived out that rent for two of the three months I lived on property (his entire defense was I was working for free rent and did not deserve paid rent reimbursement, and that I chose to leave.)

My entire small claims case was receipts for supplies purchased to be used on the property, and other expenses such as the plumber, landscaper and home utilities paid by me on behalf of the property owner during the months it sat vacant while I worked on it. 

And the judge was wrong: the small claims maximum in Coconino County is $3,500, not $3,000 as she notes. All my paperwork from Coconino County, received in September 2022, notes the max is $3,500. I checked to see if the amount increased in 2023, since I did want to sue for labor expenses, and the max amount was not scheduled to increase in 2023.

Is there any way I can ask the court to break down which receipts she was ok with, and which receipts she was not ok with? Because I highly doubt she rejected over $1,100 of proper receipts. And I just feel beat up by all of this.

Thank you.

note: the following may reveal this judge’s name, which goes against one of this sub's rules, but this judge is a public figure in Page, AZ and this is from a local newspaper article from the write-in candidates for JoP in Page this past November.

“I have been an assistant magistrate with the City of Page since 2014. I am entrusted to carry out the duties of the presiding magistrate judge in his absence and on weekends. I have held initial appearances, conducted arraignments and issued sentences. I have signed bench warrants, search warrants and orders of protection. I have also attended the New Judge Orientation, a three-week mandatory training for all incoming judges in Arizona. In August 2022, I was appointed by Coconino County as a justice of the peace pro-tem and have been working at the Page Justice Court. I have been learning the processes and procedures, and have been training under the guidance of various judges from Coconino and Maricopa counties. I am scheduled to be on the bench regularly through December 2022.”

448,Questions about brothers case,11uj4h4,"Hi, so long story short.. my brother that’s a year older than me got arrested recently. Unfortunately this has become a situation where this has become a relief to my family and I because then he is not on the streets. For the past couple years he has bounced around homeless shelters, he honestly fits in with that crowd and gets along with them.. he’s stayed with me a few time in the past but come be unpredictable and moody. I just got married a year ago and 8m preg now so taking care of him financially/emotionally is harder.
Recently he was arrested again, we were hoping they would do a psych hold on him. He needed it. Last time they just let him go after a domestic violence issue. His wife is not the most stable either. Anyway, they diagnosed him with schizophrenia. Sadly he has been diagnosed with different things over the year but nothing has seemed to stick- Manic, Schizophrenia, Bipolar. He is 1000% the ultimate narcissistic, blames everyone around him for everything.
My question is, is there a way to talk to judge to recommend some sort of mandatory check-ins like outpatient therapy or something? He needs professional help but refuses to get himself. He’s 31 now so not a lot we can do as a family. He’s just gotten worse over the years and I’m afraid one day he’s just going to run into the wrong person while having one of his episodes.",NoPen7856,2,0,0.33

The car was bought and licensed in PA. I was driving in NJ when the engine pretty much exploded and the car was history. 

Got towed from the freeway to a mechanic yard where the guy offered me $300 for my car since it clearly wasn’t going anywhere and I couldn’t do much hundreds of miles from home at 6pm on a Friday. Also couldn’t just leave it on the street where the tow truck dumped it. 

I got my stuff out of the car and took half the money. I got a written promissory note from the owner to buy the car from me. 

After I got home, I sighed the title part where you sign for a sale and sent it to him via mail. He Zelled me the rest of the money after that and I thought that was over. 

I just received a ticket from the state of Michigan with my license plate which I (didn’t know) I was supposed to remove on a new car. Apparently it’s still attached to my name.

456,Slandered by former coworker — what to do?,11uh0nc,"TLDR - coworker wanted my job and was lying trying to get it. I get fed up and leave but it gets worse with him trying to make me lose freelance clients, bashing me to friends, etc. 



I was having issues with a coworker last year essentially wanting my position in the company and trying to ‘play dirty’ to get it. He was saying I’m bad at my job, I was spending company money without approval, hiding things from our boss, intentionally not paying him (I was in charge of HR/payroll), etc. all of it was proven to not be true and I thought that was it. 

In Dec, he accused me of stalking him which resulted in a big ordeal where ownership got involved. Again, once cameras were pulled it was clear I was not stalking and was not even close to him. (He said I followed him to another part of the building, but it was a 10+ minute gap from the time he went there and I went there and I had a purpose - put a check on someone’s desk- visible on camera. When confronted with this, he basically backed off. 

I had a one on one meeting with the owner and he basically said he doesn’t want either one of us to leave, doesn’t want to burn bridges, etc. but agreed it must stop. Anyway, holidays came and he was out of office for part of it and then I was out first week in Jan. During the time I was out on PTO, more of the same continued. I’m not doing my job, I’m hiding stuff from management, acting immature, messing with his computer or phone, spying on him, blah blah blah. 

While out I started looking into other jobs. I was offered one and accepted it hoping this would be the end. As I get ready to give my notice, the owner and him wanted one final conversation to see if it could be worked out. That conversation was a disaster. So I give a notice, agree on an exit plan (company will pay my health insurance while I’m in the waiting period aslong as I’m available for questions that may arise). I’m also an IT person and had discussed with the owner that I would still assist in that area with them as a freelance client (I have others). Needless to say the guy didn’t like that and threw a fit. Basically all of this has now gotten WORSE since I left. He has -

Told multiple people that I stole money, both inside and outside the company. 
Said I was withholding multiple people paychecks, showing favoritism, etc. 
Said I was Lying about cost of things
Said I did stuff without owners approval. 
Disclosed personal information to people inside and outside the company that he gained access to after I left. 

And has even gone as far as reaching out to one of my freelance clients essentially trying to get them to drop me as their tech. 

He also was trying to get one of the reps to say that I was stealing and even lied to the owner saying they said something they didn’t. The rep is a really good friend of mine so they told me everything. He wasn’t aware I was good friends with them though. 

What I have - 
I have screenshots of emails of him threatening he won’t ‘play nice’ anymore
Screenshot of emails of him saying his check was wrong ‘4 times in a row’ but payroll records show otherwise, 
communication between him and the rep mentioned above and then what he told the owner being different. 
Camera footage that shows I did not ‘stalk him’ on the day he claimed. 

He doesn’t have money (in fact he’s having to give his brother money to help repay money his brother appearently embezzled) so I’m not going to get anything money wise. Which I’m ok with. I just want it to stop. 

What are my options? Thoughts? If I could drop $1.5-2k and this be a done deal I pretty much would in a heart beat.",NpaMA,0,0,0.5
457,"I booked a person's return flight impromptu during a trip and then cancelled it after I found out I was lied to. She is threatening to sue, Am I in trouble?",11uh0m1,"Hi there, I am currently in America. A person I was talking to for about 4-5 months romantically who is originally from Canada came to visit me in LA. I had agreed to book her flight to LA and we had agreed that we won't book her return flight yet. The plan was for her to stay here indefinitely and then figure out her return details later. The most explicit thing I said was that if she feels uncomfortable at any moment, she can safely go back and I can take care of that. I said this because she has anxiety, but just to be clear, we were planning on meeting each other for almost two months before that and were into each other. I just didn't want to visit her in Canada because I already did so once and she bailed on me the night we were supposed to meet in her city and didn't come, although she said she was severely anxious that night.

On one drunken night out during the second day she was here, she was being very cold to me, and so the next morning, I asked her what's going on. She told me many things that I did about that night that simply weren't true. I knew that they weren't true but she said I was too drunk to remember. I still gave her the benefit of the doubt even though I was reasonably certain she was wrong. After that, we were completely cool, and she said she was not annoyed at me at all. She then casually mentions how she has to go back to her city the next day because her dog sitter was only dog sitting until then, and then said we had a plan for her to go back on Wednesday. We did not have a plan for her to go back on Wednesday, and she did not mention anything about her dog. The previous day, she even casually mentioned to a friend at the bar that she's staying here indefinitely so now I was 90% sure she was lying. I said we didn't have a plan and she said she did and started yelling at me to book her a flight the next day. Eventually, she started yelling at me to book her a place as well since she didn't want to be around me.

I did end up booking her a place for that day and also impulsively booked her a flight. I was distraught and both of those things were expensive and I was confused as to what was going on but assumed that there may be a misunderstanding and still gave her the benefit of the doubt. After she left, I went to go talk to my friend and hang out with him. I wanted to get my mind off the fact I just had this happen with a girl who I thought would be my girlfriend. We were discussing the details of the night since he was present and that's when I asked if any of what she said was true. He confirmed she was lying. For example, there was a point where she told me that all of my friend's friends found me annoying, but I got my friend to ask them and myself if they did and that was a lie. She also at one point went to do coke with someone and went into the restroom and locked herself with a guy. At this point, I did not know anything about the coke. So I got concerned and started knocking on the restroom. That's when I learned she was doing coke. She told me that I overreacted especially because she and the dude both apparently told me they were going to do coke. But I knew they didn't, and the dude confirmed later on he did not tell me they were going to do coke and that she was lying. At this point, I'm extremely hurt and felt lied to and gaslighted by. She did during the moments when was yelling at me tell me she has a friend in LA and if I don't help her, she can figure stuff out. So because I was hurt and felt like I was being treated as her lapdog, I cancelled the flight by the night. I then texted her and said to get her friend to get her back to Canada after I was angry. She slept early and woke up and saw my text and obviously was very angry. She ended up paying for the flight herself at the airport.

Now, she wants to sue me for the cost of the flight. She said this is a clear cut case and is saying that I should send her the money within the next day. My parents are in Canada and she said the lawsuit will end up at their home. This scares me because my parents are extremely religious and would be hurt by the fact I was even talking to a girl before marriage, much less being in a different city with her.  I am currently in America. She doesn't know my parents or their address so I'm not sure how the lawsuit system works. She also said this is classic fraud and will pursue criminal and fraud charges against me. She also said this is a clear cut case and that she will ensure I'm publicly humiliated if I don't give her the money of the flight since apparently we had a binding agreement.

467,A part-family member owes me roughly $3800,11uevic,"TLDR:I worked with my aunt's boyfriend under the table for about 5 months, he owes me almost $4k, and I have been promised to get the money for about a year and a half now and have still not seen a penny. He has also blocked my phone number and refuses to communicate.

Hello all,

I apologize for any excessive details but I feel that some context is necessary. In 2021 I graduated high school, and at the time, I lived with my father, stepmom, my stepmom's sister(so my aunt we'll call her), my aunt's boyfriend, and a couple of my sisters as well. Around the time I had graduated, my aunt's boyfriend had recently started his own painting business and he needed some help with some paint jobs. My family thought it would be a good job and skills to learn to have me work with him after high school, mostly for the summer and the fall. My aunt's boyfriend said he would pay me a little above minimum wage($16/hour), but that it would be under the table so that it would sort of ""help us both out"".

I worked for him for roughly four months from June 2021 to October 2021 because it ended up becoming such a terrible job. I would work anywhere between 9-14 hours a day, with super inconsistent days on and off, sometimes overnight, and as time went on he began to pay me very inconsistently. In his eyes, I was one of his lowest ""priorities"" to pay money because I already had some savings of my own(which he of course knew about) and because I was ""family"" too. On top of the bad hours and schedule, it was a very toxic work environment as well. He would take the jobs as an opportunity to talk shit about all of my family members, including his own girlfriend(my aunt), and he was also just an extremely negative person who would lose his mind if he didn't get his way or if you didn't do things according to his exact rules. He would have spit flying out of his mouth with rage if any of the other few men we worked with stood up to him, and he would even get so angry that he would want to settle these conversations with coworkers by **literally having physical fights** with them.

I was always promised that I would get paid at some point, over and over, and I was honestly too gullible, I feel like this man took advantage of me in many ways. I even lent some of my own money to him so we could buy many cans of wood stain because he couldn't afford it at the time. He was basically using each paint job we completed to pay for the supplies from the previous job. I did everything properly, when I got a new job, I gave my 2 weeks to him, and all was good on that end, besides still being promised that I would be paid. I was also living in this house still, and my aunt is the owner of the house, so I was paying rent to her and her boyfriend technically. When I had my new job, I would ask a few times a month when I would be finally paid, as I wasn't even working with him anymore. Whenever this happened, this man became enraged again and didn't want to talk about it, and he would specifically pull me aside alone to tell me not to talk about it in front of anyone who lives in the house, and promised me again that it would come eventually, but that it would be a while. I of course told my dad and one of my sisters all about this each time. It sucks to have my family involved in this problem, but at least they know what's going on.

I moved out of this house to live on my own in January 2022, and as time went on I tried to maintain contact with this man and keep asking when I would get my money, which I have a record of on my phone of course. I have the list of the exact amount of hours I was not paid for, and how much money I lent him as well, and I have sent it to him multiple times. I would also communicate with my aunt(considering they are dating) and she constantly promised me as my aunt that I would rightfully get how much I'm owed at some point. I have given them both nothing but time and waited this whole time patiently to get anything. I have given them extra time as well because their dog died and there were many expensive vet bills I was told. My stepmom keeps in contact with her sister(my aunt) and so she would update me occasionally on how their lives are going, and she encouraged me to wait and give them time as well because both my aunt and her boyfriend were not doing good financially. Turns out her boyfriend was so irresponsible with managing the painting company that he had to close it down, and there were so many unpaid bills from his paint job that there were debt collectors withdrawing money from my aunt and her boyfriend's bank accounts because of it. Also around July of 2022, both my aunt and her boyfriend blocked my cellphone number out of the blue. So I have been giving them time and have been relatively unable to contact them this whole time.

472,"Fired in a ""Right To Work"" State, however, employer was potentially in breach of contract. Advice?",11ue340,"So my wife out of the blue was fired from her job as a team leader in a small company in a state with ""Right To Work"" employment laws. Her employer has been largely absent during the entirety of her employment, rarely ever responding to emails, repeatedly cancelling meetings within minutes of their start times, often deferring his responsibilities to underlings, offering nothing in the way of guidance, and pretty much leaving her to fend for herself in terms of establishing what the exact parameters and responsibilities of her position even were. Mind you, this is a company that goes overboard in publicly decrying how transparent, open, and respectful it is to workers.

Last week she sends an email to her boss praising the company on the whole, but in lieu of any sort of meetings or reliable correspondence, includes a detailed list of issues that she thought merited attention. His initial response is one of appreciation and thanks for making the effort to bring these things to his attention, a week goes by with no other communication, and then this morning she's terminated. Via email.

The reasoning he offered was...well...hard to define. The termination email was a screed of often contradictory paragraphs, praising her for certain behavior in one instance and then condemning her for the same behavior in another. In short I think she was fired because she wasn't doing her job to his wholly undefined expectations. She was never warned or reprimanded, and was only ever informed of her supposed short-comings in her termination email. 

This is where the iron sharpens the iron.

She'd only been there for about two months, within the 90-day probationary period defined on her hiring contract. However, the clause on the contract that defines the probationary period states the following, ""During this time you will receive guidance to help you become familiar with, and competent in, performing the work you have been appointed to do.""

If her immediate superior is the one that is responsible for providing ""guidance"" and so on, basically does NOTHING to train her or provide said guidance, (the proof of which is contained within numerous emails, texts, Slack channels, etc) and then fires her for supposedly not doing the job to his liking, is he potentially in breach of contract?

So I said well? She said just out it in the passenger seat. So I tossed it over on the floor. She said something and I said what? She said get out of the car. I said do you want me to turn it off? She said that’s up to you. So I put my windows up and turn the car off and open the door. As I’m getting out I grab my phone and she said out that back. I told her that I’m going to record our interaction because… and she cut me off and said no I said out that back. I tell her it’s my civil right to record.

475,Did my boss offer me a fair severance and I should move on after they discriminated against me and fired me or should I involve a lawyer?,11udxbe,"I recently got fired 5 days after my wedding and I believe it was a wrongful termination. 

I have been working from a hybrid schedule for a couple of years. I go into the office on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday while working from home Tuesday and Thursday. I work at a small person company (about 12 people) in California and have full time for about 5 years after a part time gig for about 6 months. I was making about 70k a year. Remote work has been allowed since the pandemic. 

I took Monday off because I got married on Saturday. I was working from home on Tuesday when I received and email from my Boss/CEO stating he wanted me come into the office 5 days a week from now on. I responded that this hybrid schedule has been critical for my professional and mental health and could explain to him why I valued it so much. We agreed over email to meet face to face on Wednesday. 

I go on and work like normal on Wednesday and I meet with my boss and manager. My boss reaffirms he wants to come in everyday. I let him know that I am bipolar and really need the 2 days a week at home for a few reasons, telehealth medical appointment, social anxiety, and concentration. My boss says I should come in every day and do my telehealth appointments from an extra room at work. I explain this will not work because I need to be in a safe space for my therapy appointment and sometimes I cry. I would rather not have the other employees see this. Also, this doesn't really address all my issues. My boss tells me that the energy level on the sales floor is low and he needs all the local people to come into the office. I offer to get a doctor's note and tell the other employees why I would be allowed to work from home if it would help. He asks me at the end of the meeting if these 2 days are really crucial to me and says they will get ""back to me Friday"". 

I work from home Thursday really hard to show I can do it and go into work on Friday. My boss calls me into talk. I walk into his office and my manager is sitting in there. I sit down and my boss says okay we can offer you two options. 1st option is that you start working on a part time basis for a trial period. I am pretty confused and say that I would like to find a way to continue to work full time. I ask them why? My boss says there is no energy when he walks out to the sales floor. It just feels dead out there. I say I don't think it is fair that two other employees with similar roles get to work remote and I can't. My boss states he thinks I should come in everyday and use the extra room for telehealth. I feel like I am talking to a wall at this point and tell them I don't understand this. I just had a great performance review at the end of the year where you called me consistent and now you want me to work part time, is this because of my performance or my disability. 

Saying that made my boss visibly mad. He started almost yelling, ""you no longer work for BLANK COMPANY. You need to leave immediately."" I am in shock but all I say is thank you and shake their hands and leave. 

I get my final paycheck through direct deposit immediately and my boss emails me a paper saying I am fired. He also mentions he wishes to discuss a severance agreement. I wait a few days but finally get it. Basically I say they did nothing wrong by firing me and I get $10,000. 

I feel deep down like I have been wronged and wasn't given the chance really to be heard. They didn't even ask for the doctor's note. I feel bad about accepting the money because then I am legally saying they didn't wrong me and I don't agree with that. I talked to a lawyer who agreed to work on the case on contingency and told me I could make much more than that offer. Is it smart for me to head down this road? 

I have never sued anyone but I am hoping this would just settle. I've been really struggling mentally and recently signed up for some therapy sessions. It really sucks that this also happened right after my wedding. I basically spent most of my life savings on that because my wife and I had stable jobs at the time.

So I'm currently not horribly happy with the job I'm at so I started searching around for new ones in the same industry (pharmaceuticals and biotech) which included a few contracted by the government and operate on their secure facilities. I went for a job interview at one said facility forgetting that I had a recently (within a week of the incident) purchased firearm still in my car.

481,Taxes for deceased mother and stepfather,11ud6il,"As the title says, my mothers husband (stepfather) passed away in August of 2022 after a battle with cancer. A few weeks ago my mother unexpectedly passed away as well leaving me as her next of kin. As far as I can tell, taxes for 2022 had not been filed yet. I have questions regarding both tax filing and handling of the estate and potential tax debt

From what I can understand, I would be legally responsible for filing their taxes. However, I have no idea about their tax history (i.e whether they filed jointly or separately), limited information on financials from the year as I only have my mothers W2, and have a suspicion there may have been some tax debt from prior years. Not saying they didn’t file because I believe they did, I just think they didn’t always have the money or pay what they owed. 

This is in Minnesota and estates under $75,000 with no real property don’t go through probate, which this meets that criteria. The estate has just enough money to cover the funeral services and an older car with very little value. There will be no inheritance from the estate and my intent is to pay for the funeral and leave the few hundred remaining in her account for now.

Saying that, what is the best way to go about filing taxes for them? How do I find out if there is any tax debt? Lastly, from what I can find tax debt is one that doesn’t go away with death. Can they hold me as the next of kin responsible for that money?",fur_missile,3,2,1.0

I'm wondering what rights do I have as a disabled adult. After all, the Americans with Disabilities Act is a thing so my rights should be protected under that.

Okay, can my guardian legally take my phone if I do something she doesn't approve of? To clarify, it won't be for doing anything bad per se. But for stuff that other people do every day such as being on Facebook or talking to friends she doesn't like (which brings me to my next question).

Can my guardian legally tell me who I can and can't talk to or be friends with? And it won't be because someone is a bad or dangerous person. It'll be because she doesnt like the person for some judgy or superficial reason or because she doesn't like someone the person is related to (again, for some judgy or superficial reason). She will judge people based on what they wear, their style, etc. or their lifestyle (and I don't mean lifestyle as in selling drugs or prostituting but I mean like if someone is into New Ageism or Wicca, etc.). Or if someone is gay or trans. Just stuff she doesnt approve of (don't have to be bad or dangerous stuff either).

And my third question. Can my guardian legally keep me from dating or having sex? Do I have the legal right to have a romantic/sexual relationship? If someone has sex with me, could my guardian press charges and would I have a say in the matter to tell my side of the story (that I wanted to do it, that I like the person, that nothing is really wrong with me and it's all a mistake/misdiagnosis/misunderstanding or that my guardian is just delusional and think I'm disabled when I'm really not which I do suspect, especially after learning about the Gypsy Rose Blanchard story)?",PoeticPeacenik,42,4,0.7

So how are sites like this legal? Is it because revenge porn is not banned federally? Can i create one for people to post known creeps and predators?? Like for instance, with my case the guy took photos of women who were passed out and would share them or blackmail girls. He admitted to it over text, and i found a bunch of other victims by messaging girls on insta. He threatened to sue me for defamation but everything i messaged to ppl was true AND in his own words. I really wanted to warn other local women about him bc he literally gloated about violating me and these other women.  (and he used his cute puppy to lure ppl in!!!!)

So is it legal to create a site like this or does one exist? I feel it'd be great for the safety of women in general.

I have been in communication with the at fault parties insurance company and they told me on the phone that they would pay off what I still owed on my vehicle that had been totaled in the wreck and get a little extra money back from that, they would take care of my medical bills, and reimburse me for my glasses that were damaged in the accident.

Today, I received a letter from their insurance that I can't really understand and need some help, please.

I'm always careful to latch it because I have a dog, so the only thing I can think of the that the neighbor is opening it and going into our backyard for some reason. Would it be illegal to put a lock on this gate since it would be blocking him from freely accessing an exterior wall of his garage?

503,Do I have a case for wrongful termination from my employer?,11ub4e6,"Hi Reddit,

I am currently employed at an independent pharmacy in New York. I work part time, on average 3 days/week since December 2021. I recently discovered that I am legally entitled to sick pay according to the NYS Paid Sick Leave Policy that I did not receive thus far. I figured I was not entitled to sick time because of my part time status and I don't have other benefits such as vacation/holiday pay. To my knowledge, I was supposed to be paid at least 5 days sick pay when I got COVID and had to quarantine right when I started the job in December 2021. In addition, I did not receive 40 hours in 2022 (I have accrued enough hours for the year at the 1 hour accrued per 30 hours worked). I also got sick last month and was supposed to work 27 hours but left early mid shift only working 12 hours (leaving 15 hours that should have been paid using sick time). After learning this, I contacted my employer today and he said (after much back and forth) that he will not pay me any sick time as I was not ""qualified"". I referenced the NYS Paid Sick Leave policy to which he responded he will no longer debate with me and if I wanted to contest him, that I should just hand in my keys and ""we should just end it here."" At the end of work today, someone came to collect the keys. My questions are:

1. I have very clearly in writing that bringing up this sick time pay as a debate would lead to immediate termination. This looks to me very clearly as retaliation. Do I have a strong case for a wrongful termination lawsuit? Is it worth pursuing this route? My sister is a lawyer who would represent me at no charge, but don't know how much compensation these cases usually pay out.
2. He contacted me later tonight saying that officially I will be terminated April 15 and if I can confirm my schedule for next week. Should I continue to work until April 15, and try to recuperate my sick time after termination? Or would this diminish the above retaliation/wrongful termination case?

Basically, I can go one of two ways here. Work until April 15 with confirmed pay and try to get my sick hours payed out to me. Or, I can confirm with my employer that giving my keys today was my termination and very clearly retaliation then sue and try to receive a settlement.

506,Not at fault apartment damage,11uatar,"Hey all, so I am currently renting a ‘between apartment’ meant as a temp place while I relocate. The landlord is notoriously shoddy & sue happy.

A few days ago, someone ran into my detached garage causing the door to be bowed in. My garage is on the other side of my building facing outward towards an open parking lot so I generally use street parking as it’s closer & steps from my door. Again the garage is on the opposite side of my building & I usually only run over there to empty trash or park my car in the garage during bad weather so it has been about 4-5 days. My neighbor told me he noticed it about 2-3 days ago.

My best guess is that this was either another neighbor or a guest of a neighbor. Im considering filing a police report but Im wondering if I should be doing this. My question is: is this something I could be held liable for??

Some more info, my deceased bio parent's life insurance policy was updated after their divorce to remove my other bio parent and leave me as the sole beneficiary, but it was never updated after their marriage to the new spouse (the one in question here)

They had a will, but it was created before they had a life insurance policy and never updated. (I have not seen the will yet)

Basically, I am trying to find out if their assertion that they are entitled to 1/3 - 1/2 of the policy amount is true. From my research online, the only things that seem to confirm this at all are only for Community Property states (NJ doesn't appear to be one) or when it's a term life policy (My parent had a whole life policy) 

I would also like clarification on if life insurance payouts are part of the deceased's estate. Again, my research seems to indicate the answer is no.

Jun 2021 I told my roommate/ex in a text that ~$150/mo phone was due. The ~$150/mo was implied to be half the phone bill. See the squiggle,  does the law see this the same as I do?

I had a phone contract, both our numbers had my name, but one was registered to my roommate.

June 2022 we changed the contract, both numbers to my roommates name, because they started working for the cellphone company we were using. Each of us still had a phone registered to our name.

It is now March 2023, we are still living together as roommates, we have been broken up and have been riding out our lease.

Both contracts had all the payments drafted out of my account, which is why I requested $150/mo from my roommate.

In that time period, I have paid a total of $7583.39 to the phone company. My roommate has paid me $1705.56 through zelle. I calculate a loss of $2086.14, that is what my roommate still owes me.

513,Rescinding No Contact Order,11u9qt2,"I am posting here as I am at my wits end and no longer know what to do. Please excuse any formatting or grammatical errors I am on mobile.

In September 2022 my boyfriend was arrested for domestic violence against me. This incident occurred in a city three hours away from where we live but in the same state (Washington). It is my understanding per state law regardless of whether or not chargers are filed someone must be arrested on domestic violence calls. 

My boyfriend did not assault me, we did get into an alcohol fuel verbal altercation but nothing physical occurred. Nothing like this has ever occurred before or since in the nearly four years we have been together. This incident occurred on a Saturday so he spent the weekend in jail. Monday he was released and they said they were not pursuing charges…. Until six weeks months ago. 

The city re filed charges based on the allegations in the police report. It states he punched, choked, and kicked me. All untrue and did not occur. On Feb 8, 2023 a no contact order was issued. I filed a motion to rescind this order on March 10, 2023 the judge modified the order to allow for electronic communication. I have since filed another motion with a new revised statement.

My boyfriend and I have followed the orders. Earlier today he was offered a plea deal but they are sticking firm on a no contact order between us. I do not want this order nor do I need it. I would like to move back into the home we have shared for three years. I love him and this whole ordeal has caused more turmoil and stress than I endured that night in September. We have another hearing this Monday. 

Should I retain a lawyer for myself? Is there anything I can do to sway the judge or prosecution in any way? My boyfriend has his own lawyer for the matter.

515,"Vague work week hours laws, looking for clarification",11u9n64,"Hello, I work for a manufacturing company in Oregon and am hoping to get a definitive answer from a legal expert in labor law. ORS 652.020 states that no employee in a manufacturing environment may work more than 55 hours in a 7-day work week unless the employee voluntarily signed a waiver allowing them to work a maximum of 60 hours. 

Some people at my company regularly exceed that 60 hour maximum. Our payroll and timekeeping administrator is very good at their job and issues warnings to employees if they exceed 13 hours even by a minute or forget to take an additional required break. 

Given that we have not been warned or reprimanded for exceeding the 60 hours, I'm wondering if it may be possible that they are disregarding breaks & meal periods when calculating the time worked? For example, a 13 hour shift gives four 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute meal periods. So technically only 11.5 hours were ""worked"" in that shift, if that makes sense. You do that Monday through Friday and you've only ""worked"" 57.5 hours, which means you're compliant in not exceeding the 60 hour maximum. It seems like a bit of a gray area and no single person has been able to give me a clear and definitive answer. HR said that 60 is the maximum, and it is stated in the employee handbook. The administrator was already gone for the day so I did not have a chance to ask them directly.
