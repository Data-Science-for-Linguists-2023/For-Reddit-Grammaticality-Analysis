He never seems to finish any game he buys, inviting me to play with him only to drop the game within a few days, sometimes a few hours. He seems to enjoy what he play and doesn't get bored, yet still always makes the desicion to drop games because ""There are too many games to play"", apparently.

I'm someone who always go for maximum playtime (aka ""getting good"", 100%, etc.), and while I understand some people get bored of games quickly, I do not get this ""There are too many games to play"" mindset.

12,Unpopular Opinion? — I hated Sam’s character in Uncharted 4,11uv1zv,"Not just the contrivance of a secret brother that just happened to have never been mentioned, I outright disliked Sam.  He struck as a manipulative, borderline sociopath, who had been using Nathan since they were young.  It was probably a blessing for Nathan that Sam was out of the picture for so long.

Sam could have taken Rafe’s offer and left Nathan out of it, or he could have asked Nathan directly if he wanted to go after it.  Instead he lies to his gone-legit brother about it being a matter of life and death.  Potentially getting him killed or arrested.

Also, at the end when Sam ran off to get the treasure instead of getting away with everyone, he was either idiotic, or delusional.  The bad guys had the treasure, they would never have let him leave with it.  But he runs back seemingly just so his ego can tell himself he got to it first.

15,shooters without hitmark and their sounds aren't as enjoyable,11vpzrq,"Am I alone in this? Any game without a hitmark after landing a shot just feels like am shooting sponges with a toy gun. Yes including Doom. Halo infinite also has a slightly underwhelming hitmark effect but it's there at least. I still enjoyed both games but it felt like they could've been better. 






I find COD MW2019 [hitmark sound](https://youtu.be/wz1PGK3gXXg) + gun recoil effect to be incredibly satisfying and was quite disappointed that it doesn't exist in the campaign. Overwatch headshot sound is iconic and incredibly satisfying too, the [crunch noise](https://youtu.be/3r1ILdlm750) when you land a headshot in Battlefield 5 (and the orange cracked skull you get on screen after landing it), or the hitmarker that gets bigger and bigger the more damage you deal in Battlefield 1, or the really loud [shield cracking sound in Fortnite](https://youtu.be/J0lQO26geIo).



&#x200B;



I get that the main purpose of hitmarkers is to give feedback during fast paced moments. NPCs are far more predictable than real players so you don't really need hitmarker for single player but still... It adds a lot to the experience imo and I don't find it immersion breaking unless you're playing completely with no HUD. 




Doom Eternal make enemies look and react like they've been shot to try and make it satisfying and some more realism focused games have real flesh sounds, blood splatter, wounds, etc, but it's not the same I want a satisfying click/ting/crunch :\",I9Qnl,10,0,0.29

I've been playing mostly support roles, cause I think the suit that can fly is pretty op, but I dabbled with the other classes and I think the game would benefit with a balance pass. Like the giant minigun guy is almost useless. 

Overall, I expected nothing from this game but am pleasantly  surprised at how fun it is.

20,Confession: I envy people who can delve deeply into a single game or series,11uedze,"Ever since I was a kid, my attention span has been pretty bad (Diagnosed with ADHD just recently). I’ve always seemed to have a surface level interest in a series for maybe 1-2 weeks where I’d be completely focused on a specific game or franchise. Recently it’s been The Witcher 3, before it was the Mass Effect series, before it was immersive sims, etc. Then a few weeks pass and I feel FOMO about a new franchise. I want an intense feeling of catching up, of being in the know. 

I sort of envy gamers who really know what they enjoy and are true to that. Like people who’ve played Mass Effect to death, or Resident Evil fans who can play every game blindfolded. It sounds nice to love something so much and love it not just for weeks but for years at a time. 

There are a lot of different types of gamers and obviously there’s pros and cons of having a broad but shallow gaming experience or narrow and deep.

At what point did <<<they>>> decide to fucking destroy all my dreams and make a fucking uturn on what teasers they released back a year or two? fir allif you who dont remember: it was a ~1min cut scene where a Barb walked through a super dark dungeon with underlying classic terrifying music.you could hear the sculls roll down from a lump, some stones cracking in the silence. the whole atmosphere was filled with brutally grim darkness and sorrow- the very core of Diablo. 

When i saw that ""teaser' i nearly jizzed my pants from excitement. No shiny colors, no bling bling, no numbers above the enemies heads, no special effects. just pure atmosphere and arcane pitoresque flair. 

It felt like they kmew what they were doing and i was super excited.

How the fuck did we get from there to a Lost Arc Clone?? I cant fathom how this is even possible? Did they just fire all the artists after they finished the basic assets and left the UI development to some cheap webdesigners?and left all visual design decisions to some flash-game developers from 2010? why the fuck do all spells look like some 14 yo got a new Alienware gaming PC and turned on the disco mode for the RGB-fans? why does each flame look like a fucking gas-stove? everything feels too light and poorly animated like in Lost Arc. Why on earth do we need a colored rectangle around each item? why are we so much spammed with items? why are the numbers below the ""belt"" in fontsize 30? why are potions infinitely availiable in --the belt--?

I'd be moving to the US for this, which means I can't/don't want to take my current setup (PC + PS5) with me. The way I see it, this leaves me with 3 choices:

1. Buy a new PC there - which I'm not too keen on for the hassle tbh. I don't know if I'm gonna stay in the same city that I'm doing my masters in, and I can always buy something for now and build once in 3-4 years time once I have money there.
2. Buy a gaming laptop - I already have a MacBook which I'll likely be using for college due to the battery + portability. So investing $1500 or so on a laptop which I won't use much outside of gaming, I'm not entirely sure. But this does allow me to use my entire PC library + gamepass.
3. Buy a steam deck - I'm not sure this is good enough as a daily driver. The smaller screen and performance are also not the best parts, and I'm not sure about the longetivity. But it's cheap, and I've heard good things about it.

I definitely want to go with a PC like device instead of Xbox or PS. Right now I feel like a laptop is the best choice, but I'd love to hear your suggestions! Would love some recommendations too, my budget is about $1500, and I could do with saving as much money as I can.",JustMeSach,13,0,0.3

87,Tips for first person shooters with a controller,11u2myz,"Old-ass, lifelong PC gamer here.

I recently switched to mainly gaming on an Xbox Series X because, over the years, I developed a preference for gaming in my living room, on a couch, on a bigger screen. I'm just tired of sitting at my desk because it's kind of isolating... so I decided to take a break from it. Gaming on the couch is kind of ""freeing"". My wife (or my pets) can more easily hang out with me or sit with me while I game. My wife and I also play more co-op games now, and gaming on a 65'' screen is a nice change...

I consider myself a pretty decently ""skilled"" gamer. Played many competitive games throughout the years and I have usually no issues whatsoever beating most games on ""hard"" or ""very hard"" difficulties.

I'd say the games I excel the most at are ""Souls""-like games, Adventure/RPGs, platformers and, I USED to be good at first person shooters... that is, until I played one with a controller.

I am ***NOT*** here to start a PC/console argument. That's stupid. It's just that there are a lot of interesting FPS games on Xbox and no matter how much I try, I just can't seem to do it... I have trouble aiming. YES, I could probably easily just buy it on Steam and play on my PC instead, but I want to challenge myself. I want to become good with a controller. The upcoming game [Starfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfield_(video_game)) is also a reason I'm motivated to become prolific with a controller.

I wanted to know: Do most console FPS competitive players play with an ""Elite"": style controller with paddles and customizable thumbstick resistances and inputs? Is it ***necessary*** to invest in one of these to step up your game? Or are there high-level players who manage with a standard controller?

Any tips for options in the game? My main issue is really ***aiming***... After 30+ years of aiming with a mouse, I have a really hard time aiming with thumbsticks. Auto-aim options help a little but no much. I feel like there's something I must be doing wrong. Everything feels clunky and if I want to aim a particular part of the enemy's body, it seems impossible.

After years of looking at the Devil May Cry series and being curious about it I have finally decided to take the plunge this year and give it a go in preparation for FFXVI. I thought it would be fun to do a final review of all the games to reflect on each one. If you're interested in this kind of thing I hope you enjoy these thoughts from a total newbie!

**Disclaimer: I am not an official reviewer, so these ""reviews"" are more of just my thoughts on the games and will definitely not be professional. Also, keep in mind that for my scores on each game: rather than reviewing them critically, I factor in my personal enjoyment more than how a critic might review the game. So if a score seems either higher or lower than what might seem fair to you, that is because of this personal enjoyment factor. Also this will end up being a long ass post**

Alright, *Lets rock baby!*

**Devil May Cry 1**

I of course started with none other than DMC1. I am aware of how this game was originally supposed to be a resident evil game, and it damn well shows. Considering how much I love RE, I felt right at home with this game.

*Pros:*

-Right off the bat were treated with an absolutely Bonkers intro with trish beating the shit out of Dante, electrocuting him, thrusting a sword through him, throwing a fucking motorcycle at him and I loved every second of it. I knew right from the start I was in for a different kind of game.

-This game just oozes atmosphere akin to the RE series. The dark moody theme of castle, creepy and brilliant enemy designs (Shoutout to the spine shivering cackles of the scissors), etc, this games theme is awesome.

-Combat in this game is suprisingly cool for its time. It was awesome to see a game from back then having intricacies in its combat system such as having to wait before inputs to do different combo chains, the amount of different options you have at your disposal, and the combo potential. I really appreciated this aspect of the game and couldn't wait to see how it progressed.

-CCC: Classic Capcom Cheesiness. For some I could see this being a negative but for me, again, this game felt super close to RE and I loved that aspect of the game. While the story might come off as silly, I enjoyed this older era classic capcom esque story and voice acting. For me its very charming.

-Music: Theres some cool tracks in this game including everyones favorite PTSD theme, battle theme 2

*Cons:*

**Something Interesting I've noticed about the DMC series is that I would have the same cons almost throughout the entire series : Camera, Platforming, enemy design**

-Camera: DMC 1 uses a fixed camera system and while not too annoying in a RE game, in a high paced action game like DMC it can definitely get on your nerves. When you are fighting enemies that are hitting you from off screen, getting disoriented in high stakes moments or trying to jump on certain things it definitely detracts from the experience in a significant way

-Platforming: Platforming seems to be a common aspect of the entire series and while it might not be too annoying on its own, coupled with the camera system there are some moments that can get absolutely frustrating when youre unable to correctly judge where you're jumping. It isn't as bad in this game as it is in the later games but it's still there enough to get annoying

-Underwater levels: Look, I get it. This feature was probably included at the time as a gimmick to try something new but they really arent engaging at all and slow down the pace considering how slow and cumbersome they are. Luckily theres only like 2 or three sections so they don't overstay their welcome.

-Enemy design: This is another negative that is worse in some of the later titles but isnt TOO bad in DMC1, but there are definitely some enemy types that can be annoying to fight in this game as well. I think one of the biggest detractors from the series as a whole is that the combat itself is *awesome* but the enemies you fight at times make the combat worse because of how annoying it can make the gameplay. This is a real shame considering how great the combat is when you get to fight non annoying enemies. I also am not in love with the idea of fighting bosses multiple times. Again, not a huge issue here, but in general im just not a fan, which you could disagree with (even considering the fights change as you go on). On that note, RIP Griffin and fuck you Nightmare

**Final Score: 7/10**

A good entry to the series but not quite amazing. The combat is fun, the story is batshit insane with classic capcom cheesiness, and the atmosphere is chilling, but the game does have some older school jank that holds it back from being higher for me. Still an enjoyable experience.

**Devil May Cry 2**

When looking up the DMC series I was aware of how disliked this game is. It goes so far that people say to skip this game often. Now, I am someone who makes my own opinions for myself and often have unpopular opinions (as you might find in this post) so considering that, I wanted to play the game for myself and decide: Was this game REALLY that bad? Or was it just misunderstood?

Unfortunately, the opinions on this game couldnt have been more right..

*Pros:*

-uh, Dante's outfit is pretty sick?

-I like how Dante killed the last boss

*Cons:*

Man, where to start with this game. For me, this entire game is a con. Im going to keep it short and simple so that Im not here all day being a buzzkill. The combat in this game is just not rewarding. Youre encouraged to just spam your gun the entire game which makes everything else pointless unlike DMC 1. The enemy design is atrocious  and borderline broken at times where you can just spam your gun while they cant even hit you. The music is just there. The story is basically nonexistent, with like 2 new characters that end up feeling meaningless. The level design is boring and dragged out. And on top of all of this, the three kings of faults return here: Camera, platforming, and enemy design.

**Final score: 0/10**

Now hear me out. A critic might give this game a 2/10 or a 4 simply for being a game that is playable. But like I said in my disclaimer, my personal enjoyment weighs heavy into my personal review for the game, and with this game I found nothing that was worth my time. The combat, music, story, characters, gameplay, level design, enemy design, EVERYTHING provided nothing of value to me. This game is worse than just a bad game IMO, its a *nothing* game. You feel complete emptiness while playing it. When you're playing it all you can think of is why am I spending my time doing something I am getting 0 value out of. I went into this game with an open heart, even remarking about how cool dante's movement looks when you start the game, and even then the game made me dislike it. If you are a fan of DMC2 I hope you dont take this personally and more power to you for liking the game! For me though, man this game is the *worst* game Ive ever played in my life. I am not saying that lightly, I literally mean this is the worst game I've ever played. Even a broken game like Sonic 06 has aspects like character moments that you can get some sort of value out of. This game just wasnt for me

**Devil May Cry 3**

*This is where the fun begins*

Devil May Cry 3 is where DMC makes its return as we come back with a prequel featuring a much younger and crazier Dante. This is Dante like I hadn't seen in the previous 2 games, and while the immediate shift was slightly jarring, I ended up loving this character SO much more because of this game

*Pros:*

-With the opening cutscene of this game I came away with one impression which is: The devs made this game to be *seen*. What do I mean by that? Right from the start of the game everything just gives off the impression that the devs put an immense amount of love into this game. The choreography as Dante flies around the room slaying demons, the humor of the scene, how batshit crazy and insane it all is, the characterization of Dante that becomes apparent just within a few minutes. This game gives off the impression of ""Were not just making a game to be sold, we put time and effort into this shit and we want you to be wowwed by it"". Awesome stuff.

-I made a post when I first started playing this game that it had the best combat I had ever seen in an action game, and I meant it. Holy shit dude. The combos, the styles, the weapons, the combo chain potential, the weight of each move. This game's combat system is *fucking awesome*. Its like they took what they started with DMC 1 and completely revolutionized it. Ive played a lot of action games and I cant stress enough how dissapointed I get when they just give you a light and heavy button and maybe one special movie. Combat in this game is S tier

-The story: This is the first DMC game where I felt genuinely invested in the storyline. The brotherhood rivalry between Dante and Vergil is so cool and interesting, and subplots like with Lady, her growing connection with dante and how she handles her dad is interesting as well.

-Dante: Dante is fucking crazy in this game and I love it. I'd often want to continue playing just to see what sort of bullshit hed be up to next. He is an awesome character, and while I did like the more reserved dante of DMC1, this Dante is just a marvel to watch as he does crazy shit. I also love that he still has a more serious side as we can see he does care for his brother

-Being able to fight during the credits is so sick and an awesome way to finish a game. I'd never seen this before and it really makes such a nice last impression

-*JACKPOT*

*Cons:*

-Again the three kings of faults make their return, do I gotta say it? Camera, platforming, enemy design

-Camera in this game still can be a nightmare to deal with at times when youre getting bombarded by tons of demons. The platforming sections begin to get longer in these games as well and coupled together these two aspects can be so frustrating at times.

-Enemy design. I cant lie guys, there are some fucking annoying enemies in this game. The Chess piece enemy types stick out in particular as they are just straight up not fun to fight in my opinion. It just feels like youre hitting a wall with a sword, which to be fair is basically what they are, but is not fun. Again, a huge issue I have overall with the series is that while the combat system is S tier, the enemy types and encounters can effectively make that combat system worse when they limit what youre able to do with your moves. It really drags down the experience at times.

-Boss rush: This seems to be a either love it or hate it type of thing. For me, Im not into it. I think Boss rush mechanics are better suited to either specific boss rush games or side modes, but here Im just not really a fan. Now, in this game I dont really think the boss rush was lazy per say considering how much love was put into the rest of the game, but that is different in the next game...

-Later levels can feel drawn out: Personally I feel like the pacing of the game kind of slows down a lot near some of the later levels. Some of the level design and levels in general felt kind of drawn out to me and im not sure if that was just me.

**Final score: 8/10**

Dmc 3 is a great game. I loved the new take on dante, how fucking awesome combat is and the storyline. Unfortunately for me the enemy design, pacing, and camera do detract in a significant enough way to hold me back from saying that its amazing, but I did still enjoy it. I know a lot of people put this up there as a 10/10 game so I hope you dont hate me for disagreeing!

**Devil May Cry 4**

Two more to go. DMC4 stars a new protagonist, Nero, as we follow his journey among other characters of the OG cast. For me, I was really hoping to like this game, but overall it feels to me like 1 step forward, 5 steps back.

*Pros:*

-Combat in this game, while missing some aspects from DMC3, feels like they took Dmc3s combat, refined it, and just made it feel smoother to play. It is very good and I would go as far to say that the combat system as a standalone is better than DMC3.

-Nero is pretty cool. Sure, he's an angsty teen type character but I'm happy to say I came away from the game liking him. The addition of his Devil bringer grapple where you can pull enemies towards you is just an awesome addition and I love how he feels totally different to play from Dante

-Dante is fun as HELL to play as. I liked playing as dante so much in this game that it really saved the second half of the game for me.

-The Post credit scene with Dante, Trish, and Lady is S tier. I LOVE how theyve become like a little family and how when Dante starts doing some dumbass shit, Lady and Trish back him up with equal dumbassery. Love them

*Cons:*

Unfortunately while combat feels more refined here, it also feels like this game took every con in Dmc3 and made it worse

It's no secret that this game had some development issues and it really shows. For starters the whole second half of the game is basically backtracking through every level you've played before hand in the opposite direction with some new additions. Luckily, Dante was so fun to play as that I didnt hate this as much as I could have, but after all this backtracking what are we met with?

-Another boss rush. Remember how I said in Dmc3 I wouldnt call the boss rush in that game lazy because the rest of the game had love and care? In this game it's the opposite. Because the rest of the game is lacking the boss rush here just feels like a lazy way to extend gameplay time. It was this boss rush that really just made me tired of the mechanic as a whole.

-The story and characters in this game are unfortunately just really uninteresting. I didnt care for the storyline here like I did in Dmc3 and its a shame characters like Kyrie are essentially just wasted.

-The platforming in this game along with the devil bringer and camera can just be god awful. Some of the most frustrating of the series

-Enemy designs again in this game just become straight up annoying and unfun to fight against. This coupled with the rest of the games faults really drag the combat down for me.

**Final score: 5/10**

Again, probably a lower score than most would give it, but enjoyment wise I just felt burnt out by the end of the game. Coming away from it I really could only say that I liked the improved feel of the combat, but even that was dragged down by level design and enemy design. The story didn't interest me and characters felt wasted. I was hoping better for this game but it really is apparent it needed more time. I dont hate it, I just didnt have the best experience with it

**Devil May Cry 5**

Here we are at the final game. Going into Dmc5 I was really, really hoping that this would be the DMC that id finish and think was amazing. Dont get me wrong, I have very much enjoyed playing through the series up until this point, but each game I played came with significant flaws that would detract from my overall enjoyment.

*I am very proud to say, I fucking Love DMC5*

*Pros*

-Dmc5 feels to me like a love letter to everything that DMC is as a series. Everything is back and better than ever with tons of fan service done in a tasteful way. To be clear, by fanservice I dont mean just throwing in old stuff for brownie points, rather that the devs truly understand what you loved about the past games and is giving you what you want.

-Story in this game is fucking awesome, a closely knit family story between certain characters that is just badass and interesting the entire way through. TONS of absolutely amazing eye candy scenes that are a marvel to watch.

-Characters are the best they ever been, and this is for almost every character. Nero, Dante, Virgil, Nico, I loved them all. Unfortunately my one gripe is that it seems like Lady and Trish got a bit of the back seat here but it's understandable because it's not really their story.

-Combat: **THIS is what ive been waiting for.** Combat here feels perfected. Everything that was great about DMC3/4s system not only returns, but is expanded. An absolute BONKERS amount of options and weapons at your disposal and FINALLY we get to enjoy this amazing combat system without the camera fucking us over constantly. Enemy design here is finally not an issue anymore as well. I think there was maybe one boss that I throught was a little iffy? But aside from that the enemy design is done well and you finally get to enjoy the combat system without it being held back by other factors. I actually think this is the best action combat I've seen in a game.

-Speaking of combat, this game gave me the most satisfying and rewarding moment I've ever had in an action combat game. I was in one of those states where youre just in the zone, flipping back and forth between weapons, keeping the momentum up. I was knocking this enemy between land and air, connecting things seemlessly, and right as I charged up my final finisher move the game goes into a slow mo and SMOKIN SEXY STYLE fires off as I finish the chain. I got goosebumps because of how sick it was (I know I sound like a gamespot reviewer right now, but its true!). It was the most satisfying thing I've ever experienced in an action game bar none.

-The music in this game is BUMPIN. Special shoutout to the remix of shadow's theme from DMC1. Everytime Neros theme comes on in just makes me wanna kick some ass.

-Level design is much better in this game and is rarely every annoying or overstays its welcome

-""Don't you dare say it!""

*Cons*

-Personally I kind of wish there would have been some more variety with the level design from a pure aesthetic standpoint. A lot of the environments look very samey, although I did really like the City Locale at the start and the last area where you fight Vergil

-I know this point may be controversial but I want you to keep in mind that this is just my personal opinon and am not making the point that it is an objective fact: I really dislike playing as V. While I admire them adding a new type of character that plays totally different, to me V just feels really clunky and overall unfun to play as. It feels as though his combat system just isnt fully refined yet and can be frustrating when certain things happen like shadow not doing what you want him to do or your demons abilities being tied to your own movements. For example if Im trying to evade an attack by moving back, Griffin will do his little energy release thing rather than keep shooting forward. Overall I just really hated these sections, Im not gonna lie. I think this is a concept that is cool in though but was not excecuted well. Again, this is just how I personally feel but I am not going to say V is bad from an objective stand point. It just personally wasnt for me

**Overall Score: 9/10**

Dmc5 is a near perfect game. Unfortunately when thinking about my score for this game I just couldnt push aside how much the V sections detracted for me. Almost everything else about this game though is fucking awesome, and I believe this is one of the best action games I've ever played. This game feels like a love letter to every fan of the series, and I feel like playing the other 4 games first made me enjoy this game so much more than I would have otherwise considering how much love is put in there for DMC fans. This game was the first in the series that I actually felt bittersweet when I finished playing because of how much I loved going through it. At no point was there a section where I felt ""man can we just get on with this"" aside from the V sections. I really love this game

**Final Thoughts:**

So there you have it! I had a ton of fun playing through this series for the first time ever this year. The series is awesome with a ton of good things, some bad, but overall a very enjoyable experience that Im glad to have played through. Im happy to know who these characters are now, their stories, and how awesome the combat can be in these games. Now Im really just craving a DMC6.

Sorry for such a long ass post but if you made it this far I really appreciate you checking out my thoughts and would love to hear what you Disagree or agree on! It was a blast being able to play all these games and reflect on each one. Now im off to finish Dino Crisis, peace!

8,Is steam deck right for me?,11w2zxl,"Hi all,


I am considering buying a steam deck, but I am not sure if this device is the right choice for me.

I am planning to play mostly double-A and indie games, and also some early 2000s such as dungeon siege, dragons dogma, gothic, etc.

My main concerns are battery life and the overall size of this device. I want to use it for the emulation of PlayStation 2, dreamcast, and maybe some ps3 but this part is not as essential to me.

More important are cloud gaming and streaming services (Nvidia, Xbox, PS5, etc).

It would be nice to know if playing android games is also possible. I read somewhere that you can emulate the android environment.

I don't travel a lot, so I will use the handheld in my bed or while laying on the sofa, but at some point, I am going to shove it into my backpack and go abroad.

I do consider the following handhelds:

1. Steam Deck - good ps2, ps3 emulation, I love the steam environment, but the device seems bulky and the battery apparently can hold about 1-2h if you playing newish games.

2. Odin Pro - I like the design, it's relatively pocketable, it has analog triggers (unlike RetroidPocket3), good battery life, and good android performance, also seems perfect for streaming/cloud gaming. Ps2 emulation is a bit wonky but this is a secondary priority for me. Don't know what the performance of the steam link looks like.
3. Ayn Loki Mini Pro (intel i3 1215u) - don't know much about this one, but it seems to be an upgraded version of Odin pro, but windows base.

Please advise,

Thanks!",JohnnyBravo655,8,5,0.78
9,Please help me see PROS/CONS for getting ps5 or waiting,11wg0u2,"**PLEASE READ MY ARGUMENTS!**
**They are a bit disorderly, but I don’t see very clearly all the PROS and CONS… that’s why I need some help**

I am close to finishing my ps4 catalogue, I’ll probably be finished by mid 2024.

I am thinking, however, if I should buy a ps5 or wait for ps6. This is because assuming I am finished with ps4 on 2024, there’s only 3 years until ps6 estimated.

However, I don’t “know” what to do with my ps4, since this is the first time I do this. What do you guys do? Since you can replay ps4 games on ps5, would you sell the ps4?

But if I buy ps5, then ps6 will come out soon after, and it’ll be a bit of a waste. On the other hand, if I wait for ps6, do you think ps4 games will be supported. Probably not, in my opinion…

10,What are some things gamers should not be judged harshly over?,11vyfng,"Using wikis or a strategy guide to complete point and click adventure titles. This includes old games like Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall. Some people really value their time and they don't really want to invest hours upon hours into getting stuck somewhere because they didn't talk to some dude at a specific point in time or they didn't have this item before a checkpoint or they did have the item but they couldn't figure out the clues which can be vague, as to what to do with it.

It can be very mind grating and turn people off from completing the game normally.

The other thing is - cheating in Single Player games. I will emphasize on Single Player heavily. Who's to judge how people find fun in their games? For me, sometimes cheating is actually more fun than just grinding away. Yes, I want everything, fucking give it to me now. Give me God Mode, let me mow down these asshole enemies that have killed me hundreds of times before when I tried going through the game the 'right way'.",nyghtrite,32,4,0.57

12,I just can't stay on one game for very long...,11wbfj1,"So I'm a big gamer, ya see? I play a lot of games, mostly on PC (and more recently my steam deck), to the point where I have more than 120 games on Steam (123 to be exact) I even have a few 100s of hours on some of them, manly Terraria, Satisfactory, Hollow Knight, Spelunky 2 and most importantly, Minecraft

But I often see people with playing times in the thousands, and I just don't know how... There are Youtubers and Streamers who can play the same game for years, doing challenges and installing mods, but without getting bored

Meanwhile, the longest amount of time I've been on a game recently is about a couple of months, maybe 6 at best. And it's an exception. The only games I stayed interested in for this long were Spelunky 2, the Binding of Isaac, Bloons TD 6... And I'm pretty sure that's it. (there was also Minecraft which I used to play for months and months when I was pretty young, but that spark never lit up again...)

And don't get me started on Multiplayer. As soon as a week of playing a game with my friends goes by, I just don't want to play anymore, or at least not for very long... Minecraft, Deep Rock Galactic (rock and stone), Overcooked 2, Stardew Valley, wether it be with my friends or my family (mainly my father), multiplayer games are just annoying to me because of this horrible trait that I have. I think it's got something to do with my brain realizing, at some point during the session, that I can't really chose when I want to stop playing (which is kinda wrong, and kinda true), and from that point forward, I just stop having any fun on the game to the point where I avoid playing it with my friends entirely 

So I'm here to ask for some advices. There are a lot of games I want to play, and not just for a couple of hours. Rhythm games likes osu!, survival/""sandbox"" games like Stardew Valley, story or exploration games like Outer Wilds or Return of the Obra Dinn, but I just can't, and I don't know how to fix that...

The old Call Of Duty Games such as Ghosts, Black Ops III, Advanced Warfare, Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, World War II all have the full campaigns on disc and ready to play at launch with no need to go online and download the packs just to enjoy the content that's suppose to be on disc.

30,What single player game stories do you think can *ONLY* work as a video game? More info in the description. Spoilers for TLOU2.,11w9o6c,"By this I mean....something like the Legacy Of Kain series for example I could easily see working as a movie or book series. It's a fantastic franchise (one of my favorite) and has a great story, but it's something that isn't dependent or profound due to specifically video gaming as a medium. Same thing with something like Xenogears. To be honest, I would kind of prefer Xenogears as a book, manga, or TV series (assuming it was done right) lol.

Contrary, I feel like stuff like Ico, Shadow Of The Colossus, The Last Of Us (this one might be kind of controversial), etc. Things where the gameplay itself contributes significantly to the experience. For example The Last Of Us. I do think the show is very good, however I feel like many moments hit harder through being a video game because in many of the tough scenes *you* are physically the one committing the violence (or whatever else it is) so it may hit some players harder because of that. I know that specifically in TLOU2, there are many sections that I can't imagine being as compelling through strictly a visual medium. Some of the sections hit harder because as much as I didn't want to personally do XYZ, *I personally had to make those actions happen to progress the story*. It wasn't Ellie on screen drowning Abby, it was ME drowning Abby...etc. Same thing with Bioshock 1. The twist hits harder because you feel like you were personally tricked. I don't think it would land as hard as a show or in a book. 

The obvious low hanging fruit would be open world titles where you can do whatever you want, whenever, and games where you have the option of multiple choices to determine the story. I would prefer to stay away from games like thar if possible, but you're free to suggest them if you can't think of anything else. Souls titles are also kinda low hanging fruit since they are basically entirely about your personal resolve and willpower in overcoming an obstacle. I feel like those games are played more ""outside"" of the game than in them, if that makes sense (ie the biggest part of the game is your mental fortitude, not anything else).

Sam could have taken Rafe’s offer and left Nathan out of it, or he could have asked Nathan directly if he wanted to go after it.  Instead he lies to his gone-legit brother about it being a matter of life and death.  Potentially getting him killed or arrested.

Also, at the end when Sam ran off to get the treasure instead of getting away with everyone, he was either idiotic, or delusional.  The bad guys had the treasure, they would never have let him leave with it.  But he runs back seemingly just so his ego can tell himself he got to it first.

Probably not fun enough to buy at full price... And I expect it won't survive for very long if it's dependent on a solid player base, but fun none the less.",StupidestGuyNominee,8,2,0.58
45,Confession: I envy people who can delve deeply into a single game or series,11uedze,"Ever since I was a kid, my attention span has been pretty bad (Diagnosed with ADHD just recently). I’ve always seemed to have a surface level interest in a series for maybe 1-2 weeks where I’d be completely focused on a specific game or franchise. Recently it’s been The Witcher 3, before it was the Mass Effect series, before it was immersive sims, etc. Then a few weeks pass and I feel FOMO about a new franchise. I want an intense feeling of catching up, of being in the know. 

I sort of envy gamers who really know what they enjoy and are true to that. Like people who’ve played Mass Effect to death, or Resident Evil fans who can play every game blindfolded. It sounds nice to love something so much and love it not just for weeks but for years at a time. 

There are a lot of different types of gamers and obviously there’s pros and cons of having a broad but shallow gaming experience or narrow and deep.

Where do you guys stand?",billistenderchicken,75,68,0.76
46,shooters without hitmark and their sounds aren't as enjoyable,11vpzrq,"Am I alone in this? Any game without a hitmark after landing a shot just feels like am shooting sponges with a toy gun. Yes including Doom. Halo infinite also has a slightly underwhelming hitmark effect but it's there at least. I still enjoyed both games but it felt like they could've been better. 






I find COD MW2019 [hitmark sound](https://youtu.be/wz1PGK3gXXg) + gun recoil effect to be incredibly satisfying and was quite disappointed that it doesn't exist in the campaign. Overwatch headshot sound is iconic and incredibly satisfying too, the [crunch noise](https://youtu.be/3r1ILdlm750) when you land a headshot in Battlefield 5 (and the orange cracked skull you get on screen after landing it), or the hitmarker that gets bigger and bigger the more damage you deal in Battlefield 1, or the really loud [shield cracking sound in Fortnite](https://youtu.be/J0lQO26geIo).



&#x200B;



I get that the main purpose of hitmarkers is to give feedback during fast paced moments. NPCs are far more predictable than real players so you don't really need hitmarker for single player but still... It adds a lot to the experience imo and I don't find it immersion breaking unless you're playing completely with no HUD. 




Doom Eternal make enemies look and react like they've been shot to try and make it satisfying and some more realism focused games have real flesh sounds, blood splatter, wounds, etc, but it's not the same I want a satisfying click/ting/crunch :\",I9Qnl,12,0,0.32

It feels like a lot more that Sony just doesn't care at all about their popularity or fan base and its a lot more interested in its 11+ live service online games direction their investing in and big cinematic stuff. 

It feels like a lot of their quite unique, creative and fun games from the PS3 Era and older generations are probably never going to get rebooted or come back with Jim Ryan at the head of the game studio. 


Franchises such as:


Resistance Fall Of Man(insomniac won't be working on this in the future or any time)

Jak&Daxter

Killzone(guerilla said it's a dead franchise with no returns for the future from them)

Infamous(insomniac said it's basically dead ATM)

Sly Cooper

The Order 1886

P.A.I.N. 

Socom 

Syphon Filter

Twisted Metal(rumored to be getting an online only free to play live service game soon)

Warhawk

Starhawk(a fun RTS base building, western Sci Fi story game)

Heavenly Sword(Team Ninja might never bring it back tbh)

Medevil(got a remake on ps4 but that was it, nothing else came from the icon)

Lair(Definitely deserves a better reboot/remake)

Wipeout 

Jet Moto 

Playstation Home(Would be great to see this return for audiences to have fun in a world full of the great titles of the company and their own challenges with friends and more socially)

Siren(with the popularity of survival horror I'm surprised they haven't done anything with this great creepy af horror game)


I just miss when Sony was more invested in the fun creative experiences and story driven games rather than be petty about Call Of Duty being removed off the system, and them being so obsessed with live service game experiences with them being so proud to announce they have 11+ service games in the works.

In my first point, Odin is very likable and seems coherent and fair in the story, sure you can say he's being manipulative, and he is, but he isn't unfair or cruel at any point, he never becomes a solidified bad guy in the story, even when he kills brok, it's only after kratos killed heimdall, he even multiple times tries to reason with kratos yet is denied, and is only pushed into the story via atreus. Thor on the other hand the god who beat beat his son half to death for allowing his other son to die, is now just a sad, drunk, and a semi-decent father, i know writing wise both these character's were really well done, but i can't be the only one that wanted to see the all powerful master-mind, and the violent (mirror to old kratos) god of thunder.

Secondly, we spend 20 hours of campaign we play in 2018 gearing towards Ragnarök, and then wait 4 years for GOW Ragnaröks ragnarok (sorry), and then a large amount of the story only to find out that ragnarok only affects asgard? this really lowers the stakes and i don't see alot of people talking about it, why would they choose to undermine so much of the player expectations and time like that? it was also a really good way to end the Norse saga and move on with atreus, i really can't think if why they would undermine this key point in the Norse mythology.

Furthermore on kratos' arc, we see him come to terms with who he is in 2018, he knows he's not a monster, he's fine with cleaving humans in half in Ragnarök (people who are starving, and freezing to death in fimbulwinter), yet for huge amounts of the story in Ragnarök he's completely against killing gods, or going to war with asgard, and i really can't understand why, asgard is sending limitless einherjar at him, sent Thor at him, sent Valkyries at him, and he even turned down there peace offering, but constantly moans he doesn't want to fight them? even when he fights Heimdall, he gives him multiple chances to surrender, and when he doesn't and dies kratos feels bad? i don't understand how, especially when he doesn't feel bad about killing Baldur? he even tells Freya he doesn't regret killing him. which doesn't add up and feels like the writers are rehashing an already finished character arc.

onto my point section, the game itself fails to give meaningful moments like in 2018, mostly due to the fact that you spend so much of the campaign in Ragnarök doing things that end up not affecting gameplay or the story at all:

iron woods (nice story wise, but horrible for replays),

tyr (i know he odin but still, you can't spend hours searching for him just to get nothing),

fenrir (again nice story wise but he doesn't even kill odin like in the myth, imagine if after you revived him you could whistle and realm travel from anywhere to gateways?),

playing with mjolnir (i know why we didn't get it, the axe, but stealing god weapons was always a big part of god of wars identity, even if it was for a short bit like in a boss fight, i still would've liked to play with it),

the mask, (this plotline ends up being pointless)

the realms (vanaheim was a jungle and svartleheim wasn't that interesting either, i would've liked if svartleheim was just a giant mine cave akin to moria from lotr, asgard was also a disappointment we hear from mimir in 2018 how odin loved his gold architecture, and how pretty the realm travel room is, just for asgard to just be a wooden village didn't feel right and even lowered the hype for the finale a lot too),

lastly the boss fight weren't up to par especially considering how epic Baldur's fight was in 2018, riding/fighting on a dragon, fighting around the corpse of a dead giant, atreus proving himself, and kratos choosing to be better all of it was masterfully done, but in the finale of Ragnarök we fight a few groups of enemies, teach atreus a lesson about war, we fight thor again with the exact same moveset from the first time, and this time it's alot less epic because theres no cinematic besides him carrying you for the first 5 seconds, and odin who again doesn't want to fight, kills thor for betraying him, which doesn't make sense, if he wants peace and only wants to look inside the portal why wouldn't he surrender with thor? even freya was ok with letting him live at the end, but alas we fight and as we predict he loses, dies, and the mask plotline goes nowhere. atreus then decides to move on so he can have a solo game and kratos retires / becomes the new ""all-father"".

in my consensus, this game isn't good, its visuals, and voice acting are 10/10, but we didn't get the characters we deserved, the settings were a downgrade, the climatic points felt expected and boring, and the game has little to no replay-ability, whereas i have personally replayed gow 2018 5 times, and went into Ragnarök really wanting to love it.",kazr3d,6,0,0.5

35,Should I buy a Ps5 or Steam Deck as a Switch owner? More than 10 years no gaming,11ac83z,"I bought a Nintendo switch during the pandemic. Prior to that I hadn’t played any video games in 10 or so years, which means I’ve had plenty of games to catch up on since then. I remember when I was gaming in my childhood I only had Nintendo consoles and then had a ps3 right around when I quit gaming. At the time I was playing call of duty and metal gear solid before my hiatus. I Just bought portal on switch and can’t wait to play it for the first time! 

Now that I’ve had the chance to play dark souls on switch and sekiro and assassins creed origins on stadia, I’ve realized I’ve been missing out on a lot of great games that I can’t play on my switch. (I know stadia got a lot of hate but I really loved it!) for me, better graphics are great but also not a deal breaker. My TV brand is literally called “OK” and is just that. It works no complaints. 

This brings me to my dilemma. I can’t decide if want to buy a ps5 or a steam deck.  Initially, I thought I wanted a ps5 since it’s the latest and greatest. However, when I get to thinking about the things I like about the switch’s portability it makes me re-consider. I live overseas now and sometimes travel back to the US / other places . I really love taking my switch with me and playing while I have some downtime or on the plane. On the other hand, I also wouldn’t die without it but it’s nice to know it’s there if I want to play. Additionally, I  love being able to play my switch in bed or on the around the house / terrace when it’s nice out. 

Part of me doesn’t want to miss out on some of the PlayStation exclusives like ratchet and clank, ghosts of tshusima , horizon etc but I have sooooooo many other games that I haven’t had the chance to play! Think splinter cell, fall out, every big game not on switch, etc.   Part of me wants to sacrifice the portability for exclusivity but I also don’t want to lose it for 3-4 games. 

If it matters, I have quite a few games on switch I want to play before I buy a new console. Therefore it could be close to the end of the year before im ready to purchase. I know once I get a new console the switch will be retired. Reddit, please help my indecisive self make a decision!",jgroce,10,0,0.5

If a company  was going to pay for exclusivity on a specific game opposed to buying a studio (like Microsoft / Activision) why doesn’t  this fall under anti-competition? Or because it’s not a merger/acquisition is doesn’t come into play? Exclusivity is the definition of non-competitive no? I guess if the studio is owned, it’s open market and anything goes?

I am in need of some video game suggestions for me and my wife to play together. For some context, I've grown up playing a variety of video games my whole life whereas my wife has little to no experience at all. Pretty much any exposure she's had to video games has been through me but it hasn't been much. We've played things like Mario Party, and have recently been working our way through It Takes Two and she seems to enjoy them but we're looking for something new. Below are some criteria for what I'm looking for.

1. **Something not too difficult or complicated for people with no gaming experience.**

This one is rather obvious but a game we play together can't have systems and mechanics that are too complex. Furthermore, the game can't have too many things on screen at the same time. She should be able to pick up the game and not feel dumb while she's playing it.

2. **A Co-op Game.**

Any games where my wife and I are competing against each other would most likely have to be ruled out. There would only be a few exceptions to this such as games that even out skill differences through various mechanics. Mario Party would be a good example of this (for the most part).

3. **A Game With a Story.**

So far my wife has yet to experience a game with much of a story, It Takes Two being the most story a game we've played has had. This is not a must but it would be a huge plus as she loves getting invested in characters.

4. **Something with a little more action than Stardew Valley.**

I only say this because I see Stardew Valley and games like it being suggested for non-gamers all the time. This makes perfect sense for most people, however, I tried Stardew Valley with my wife before and she said it was too boring for her.

5. **Preferably a game without dual stick camera control.**

My wife hates dual stick camera control. It's incredibly disorienting for her and she can get discouraged when, for example, in It Takes Two she can't make a jump in a platforming section not because of her skill but because she can't seem to get the camera right. The game doesn't need to be completed void of player controlled camera movement, just nothing that requires a lot of it. In the past she's tried Fall Guys and the camera movement required for that game didn't seem to be too bad for her.

&#x200B;

I know that my list of criteria may be too specific for any one game to fit the bill but that's just the general idea of what I'm looking for. In other words, the game wouldn't have to fit every single one of those things exactly. I would say if a game fit about 3 to 4 of those points then I would love to hear the suggestion!",fattyfewsteps,9,1,0.57
65,Atomic Heart Opinion?,11a53lq,I have played a few hours of this game. Whilst the Art Team for this game clearly knows what they are doing. I unfortunately can't say the same for the Development/Programmer team? The Combat feels like a pre PlayStation 2 era game. The movement feels very floaty and the dialogues for the chars just seem very beginner voice actor like? This is just my own opinion but what do others think?,Nocturnal_Toker,21,0,0.4

67,Let's Talk About Those Awesome Games That We've Overlooked,11a5ig4,"Hey gamers,

I know we all have our favorite games that we love to play, but what about those hidden gems that never got the recognition they deserved? These are the awesome games that deserve more attention and appreciation, and I think we should talk about them.

Personally, I've stumbled upon a few hidden gems that have left a lasting impression on me. One of my favorites is ""Hollow Knight"", an action-adventure game that has stunning graphics, an immersive storyline, and challenging gameplay. Another game that I love is ""Celeste"", a platformer that has beautiful pixel art, an amazing soundtrack, and a heartfelt story about mental health and overcoming obstacles.

These games may not have received the attention that they deserve, but that doesn't mean they're any less awesome. I think we should give them the recognition that they're due, and share our love for these often overlooked titles.

So, what are some of your favorite hidden gem games? Let's have a conversation about them, and discover new games that we may have missed out on. After all, gaming is all about the experience and the journey, and these hidden gems offer us that and so much more.",crossandio,9,0,0.33
68,Punch-Out (Wii) is one of the best games ever made,11a54ot,"I remember my first experience with Punch-Out on the Wii. The game had just come out, I was about 10, and my family had rented the game on GameFly (remember when that was a thing?) and I thought it was absolutely impossible. I played the game for hours, but could never get past King Hippo by the time we returned it. 

Since then, I had put hours into Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out, slowly reaching a point where I can pretty much get up to the Soda Popinski fight without a fight going into the second round. I wanted to give Wii Punch-Out another chance. I bought the game in around 2017 (before the game really began to skyrocket in price thank god) and what used to be a brutally impossible game was one where I got about 2/3 of the way in before I was even knocked down. 

That isn’t to say Punch-Out for the Wii is some super easy game and I just sucked at gaming as a kid. Punch-Out is one of the most brutally difficult and demanding games I’ve ever played to this day (and I sucked at gaming as a kid). 

Punch-Out is essentially a series of 13 (with one extra one in an alternate mode) boss fights. Each fighter starting with King Hippo (the fourth fighter) feels like an immovable wall and all you can do is lightly tap it. But slowly, you learn what makes them tick. You learn how to dodge their moves and where their weaknesses are. You find more openings and learn how to create your own. Soon, you’re able to fully dominate and control the ring until your opponent falls to the ground. It’s a brutal learning curve made of blood, swear, and tears, but it’s one of the most satisfying games I’ve ever played. If you’re a gamer who enjoys the methodical breaking down and exploiting of a good Souls boss, this is a game you need to play right now.

I’ve been replaying the game recently and the moment I truly realized this was one of the best games ever was the Aran Ryan fight. This is the first fight of the final circuit and it’s a brutal one. All his moves are near impossible to dodge and you can only counter with one punch each (when you normally get 5-6). Then some dialogue in between rounds gave me the edge I needed. You aren’t supposed to dodge Aran Ryan like every other fighter. You’re supposed to become an immovable object yourself and punch him head on as he rushes toward you. I still fell a couple times as two of his moves were really tough to time, but I soon took him down.

This really is an amazing game I feel kinda went under the radar. If you like overcoming impossible odds in a brutally tough, but totally fair challenge, this game will be just for you",willrsauls,5,2,0.64

Oh no. They completely remove it from sale so that no one can ever buy it again.

Why? It makes no sense to me.

Marvels Avengers for example. It's a game that can be played single player. It didn't do as well as the devs liked so they're giving it one big last update and then moving on. Fair enough.

But then, in September they're also going to completely remove it from sale, even digital store fronts? Um... why?

All they're doing is stopping themselves from being able to make any amount of money off the games they do this to. It goes from a game that wasn't as successful as they liked but they can still get a small trickle of money from people who still want to play it off into the far future, to a game that they have chosen to never be able to make any money from ever again, and if people want to play it they HAVE to pirate it.

&#x200B;

Can someone please explain this to me? I see literally no benefits of removing a product from sale that's already made and has no distribution costs.

&#x200B;

Edit to add: Purely online games I kinda get for server hosting reasons, but it's happening to single player games, or games that have single player components as well; and single-player games that have ""online requirements"" can be patched to not require an internet connection.

127,Atomic Heart is a technical marvel and I think we have to acknolwdge this regardless of what we think of the devs or the lack of a FOV slider.,119tlbz,"In an era where 8 out 10 triple A games release in an unplayable state because of stutter or just plain horrible performance that doesn't scale well between different hardware, playing a game like Atom Heart is like finding an oasis in the middle of the desert.

Like the game or not (in my case I am loving the game) but I think it is very important that we express how important it is to release games with this level of polish. The game is flawless in terms of performance and stability, there is 0 stutter and 0 fps drops and maintaining very high fps. It is smooth as butter while being one of the best looking games I have played in a long time. Yes devs committed a big mistake not adding a FOV slider and disable mouse smoothing setting but we cannot take that and generalize and say they are clueless I think that´s being absolutely unfair.

Devs have to understand that people dont give a fuck about waiting five or even 10 minutes the first time we launch the game if that means we are going to have 0 stutter for the rest 70 hours of playtime.

I know we're now having kind of a resurgence of the PSX/N64-era graphics in the indie scene, but seeing how this surreal 3D images were such a huge (and specifically 90s) vibe back then, I wonder if any indie dev has ever tried to make a whole First Person game or something like that with this aesthetic.

I know I haven't heard of it, but maybe it does exist, does anyone know?

If you don't know what I'm talking about I mean this type of images, they always were used in either super compressed videos or as promotional material for stuff. Has anyone tried to make an actual game that looks like this? And if so, is it worth it?:

140,Can you help me,119rw92,"So since I became a father obviously the amount of game time I have has dropped quite a bit. And my whole life i’ve been a diehard CoD guy. And it honestly hurts me to admit i’m kinda done this year. I can’t keep up with how good people are and the games are designed to only be fun when you can grind the hell out of it. So i want to get into single player games. i’ve played a lot but i want to ask for some recommendations. i’ll give more details of what i like below. 

My best friend just built a gaming PC as well so I’m looking for good single player and coop games. 

So i guess what i like in single player games are games that i obviously don’t have to grind in order to have fun. I really like FPS because of call of duty but games like High On Life didn’t seem worth it to me because I heard it only took like 6 hours to beat the game. maybe on sale but didn’t sound worth it full price. so i want a game that takes a bit of time to complete but not something that feels like a chore i have to grind through. i made a separate post on this account where i was looking for a game like Into The Radius on VR and it’s basically a game where you have a base that has all of your loot and you choose what you take with you and pick some missions then go out into the world to do your missions and loot stuff as you go then you come back and unpack your bag and do it again. that’s the most fun i’ve had in a game in a LONG time. but it sounds like those kind of games are scarce. kinda like single player Tarkov. I like tarkov but i’m just over the multiplayer stuff. i need games i can pause at a moments notice if the kid or woman need me. while FPS is my favorite i’m open to anything i’ve TRIED every genre i can think of even CIV6 it was way too much for me to learn but just as an example that i’m open to whatever. 

to sum it up 
- FPS would be sweet
- not too short, but not so long i have to grind to enjoy it
- genre type isn’t make or break i’ll try anything
- something i can pick up and play for 1 hour or 7 hours and still have fun with it either way

I’m sorry this is so long I love gaming so much and i’ll never lose it as a hobby i just want to have fun with it again. i know those games are out there still. I’m just tired of every single multiplayer game having a stupid “meta”

143,Marvel vs Capcom on a calculator???????,119rhkm,"Some years ago, when i found out there were ports of famous games like Doom or Flappy Bird on scientific calculators, i briefly became obsessed on calculator games and the capabilities of those devices in regards of gaming. One day, when i was searching other ports or emulators for various calculators, i stumbled upon a webpage that supposedly offered a downloadable Marvel vs Capcom game for the TI-83 Plus. I obviously didn't believe at that time (and still don't believe to this day) that a scientific calculator can run a game like MvC, so i took it as some sort of scam and forgot about it. Recently that page and that supposed game came back to my mind and i decided to try it out myself using an emulator. Unfortunately i can't quite seem to make it run, and honestly don't understand how these things work, but it makes me curious how you can also download a text file alongside the game that explains you how to play and gives some basic advice on how combos work in Marvel vs Capcom, which makes me think if this is a real fighting game for a Texas Instruments calculator. In that same page you can look at the other works from the guy that made the game, and he apparently made a MvC2 and Fatal Fury ports alongside other stuff, which also catches my attention on whether these fighting games are legit or not. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit to post this but i needed to talk about this somewhere so this was my best option to see if someone can confirm if this is real or just complete BS.

146,Too analytical to enjoy games like I used to,119qlp6,"So I want to ask for any and all advice/opinions on an issue I'm having. I have loads of single player games I have yet to complete, currently finally getting around to playing through rdr2 campaign atm, but I feel like I've gotten so over analytical about games that I can't immerse myself anymore. To be clear, I think it's me and my mindset. I've become too focused on not missing anything. I don't have the patience or time to replay games a second time like I used to, so if I make a bad decision or mess something up I feel like I have to fix it. I just got done playing metro exodus and it was excruciating because I would spend 3 hours on every level trying to find every last scrap and wouldn't move on til I did. It really sucks the fun out of games and makes something enjoyable turn stressful. I think I need a mindset shift but idk. I just want to be able to feel immersed again.

162,So I finished atomic heart today. (Spoilers),119nyh2,"Here’s the review 

-story
The story was alright the main character was a basic action protagonist but I didn’t mind it. The intro was very long though. And the first plot twist was very predictable the second twist was good but the third twist in the story felt cheap. The whole “guy that helped you throughout the game turned out to be the real bad guy” twist would’ve worked if they actually give hints throughout but they really didn’t. I also didn’t like how they got rid of the doctor character at the end of the game by just killing her off screen and having that be it. I really REALLY hated the ending it felt rushed just for a dumb twist they could’ve done differently. 

-Gameplay
The gameplay is decent, the melee combat reminded me of dying light 2s combat. And the guns were decent, I know you have to explore the world to get more guns but I really couldn’t because robots were everywhere and they would beat my ass so I just kept going on with the story so I missed a lot of stuff. The perk system was simple and I really like that I don’t like overly complicated perk systems. Example: “you need to upgrade this thing 3 times in order to get this perk” it’s just a very simple thing.
The enemy’s can get very annoying when you’re trying to get from point a to point b because they’re always on your back. The qte’s can be surprisingly hard to pull off especially at the final fight where you have to fight the twins. 

-graphics 
This really doesn’t matter but I just want to praise how beautiful this game looks at the beginning I was going surprised the game’s aesthetics make the game feel like a dream. 

This game was decent the story could’ve used some work but the gameplay was good.

I’d give it a 7/10.",ultradestrution,3,0,0.33

Usually games that I find myself getting lost in are either games with high-arching, well-written stories, or fun, impressive, simulators. To exemplify, Zelda's BOTW, Elden Ring, TLOU 1, and games like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley. 

Other games I loved: Prey, Fallout 4, Final Fantasy (7,8,9,10), Zelda games, SOMA, Story of Seasons (Harvest Moon), Bear & Breakfast, Little Witch in the Woods. 

Games I didn't enjoy: The Witcher, Skyrim, Dragon Age, Horizon, God of War, Minecraft, Monster Hunter, Final Fantasy 14. 

Some games do an amazing job with their world building, like amazing details, rich, creative in-game cultural elements such as their own language, background reading, books, memorabilia by characters that ties the characters, the world, and story really well. I seriously enjoy that. For instance, I love how rich FromSoft games' lore is. I can get sucked into them for months, researching, digging, piecing things together. In BOTW, each destination is so distinct and unique, I really felt like I was traveling somewhere new. My curiosity was constantly being satiated, exploring new areas and meeting new characters. In Animal Crossing, I enjoyed slowly building a massive world. I appreciated the fun cultural elements of the game's branding everywhere (AC hoodies, items), and the hilarious bank system, traveling tickets, and renovating/collecting items. The cute graphics made it even more fun to play.

- Playable in short bursts 
- long term progression 
- a chill area (farm / base building)
- base is buildable with friends (like stardew valley?)
- friends may play while I’m offline (server system?)
- go out and explore and fight together ? 
- some kind of scalability (factorio?)

I’ve played ark a lot but it’s kind of an unoptimized mess and it’s too huge to get into / too time intensive.

The Gamecube may very well be peak Nintendo and despite not being as strong as the PS2 in terms of third party software, there are still plenty of solid to great third party titles. 

But one thing I want to point out specifically is how amazingly Gamecube games (especially first party games) have aged graphically. Especially if you use a GC video device, Gamecube games can still rival a lot of games coming out today visually. Wind Waker is still one of the most beautiful games out there and Luigi’s Mansion set a standard of pushing hardware capabilities way further than anyone thought they could go with its lighting and dust effects. Water animation technology may have also come a long way since 2002, but no water in video game history looks more refreshing to run around in than the water in Mario Sunshine.

Looking for something similar.   Watching The last of Us series made me think of that game but it, and the game that came with the ps5 - GoW Ragnarok (which I just sold) seem more like cinematics and ""hit x to interact"" type games.   Like a movie you just hit a button for once in a while.

One thing I love about rpgs/jrpgs that take place in cities is just getting to walk around the city and look at all the details and find stuff to interact with. Going into shops and talking to npcs and just getting to run around in these places 

I also really love games like animal crossing and stardew valley where all you do is chill, talk to npcs, take care of your little area whether you are farming or decorating 

I wish there was a slice of life game that is set in a city where you get to make friends around the city, complete tasks, and kinda just live. But most slice of life games take place in the country side or a farm. And I do understand why those places are chosen over a noisy and complicated city

Maybe I’m just weird for thinking a game like this would be enjoyable. I don’t know other people who like the exploration of modern cities part of some video games as much as I do.

I want to organise my consoles and games, I have about 215 games between 7/8 consoles in my collection. I'm running out of ports on my TV I have 3 HDMI and 1 AV. My TV is rather awkward to plug stuff into since its wall mounted also. The particular problem is the AV ports since I can't see behind my TV without moving a tall bookshelf of games and consoles its rather difficult and I have I think 3 which use that connection.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is what people have done with their various consoles in terms of being able to plug them in and store them.

I have tried looking for HDMI splitters and switches but I wanted one with an AV connection on it too but that might mess if visuals from upscaling unless I have it wrong? I'm also pretty sure one like that doesn't.

TL;DR Two bookcases for consoles not enough space, need more ports and ideas for organising the games and consoles.

The consoles I own are: PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5, Nintendo 64, Switch, Wii, Xbox 360, DS, PSP, PS Vita

I saw a video when I looked this kind of thing up and there was a Lego game of Marvel characters where you were Ironman and the player was just hovering and kind of flying around a bit…that’d be cool if you could just fly around but where more of the game is actually for the flying not - play a whole bunch to get to that point of a game like Anthem and just fly around a world meant combat, and 10 different other things and flying is more of an after thought.

And not like Flight Simulator.  I have that and while it’s cool, I don’t want to be worried with all the sim stuff.

226,"What games are actually BETTER on console, even if you have a gaming PC?",11954wq,"Question:

What games are actually *BETTER* on console, even if you have a decent spec gaming PC (Nvidia RTX, high end CPU, etc)?

Meaning, any games released on both console (any of them... Nintendo, Sony, Xbox) and PC, but somehow is better on console due to features or, rarely, performance?

I'm excluding the following scenarios:

* Emulated games... yes, I realize I can run Breath of the Wild in 4K on my Nvidia RTX, illegally.
* Console exclusivity - Of course Super Mario Odyssey plays best on Switch. There is no PC version.
* Handheld/portability as the only reason - The game being ""portable"" is a feature of *every* Switch port, so I'm excluding portability as a reason here. There would be too many options if portability is your main focus.
* **Timed** exclusive features... if certain games have DLC only available on PlayStation or Xbox or whatever, but, they'll eventually be released on all platforms after a year or so, that doesn't count. (eg. a certain Wizard School themed open-world RPG with its *timed* PlayStation-exclusive quests and potion recipe).
* Big Screen TV, Couch, Etc - a PC can be hooked up to a TV easily with HDMI being on nearly all graphics cards these days.

Some examples I can think of (opinions):

* Batman: Return to Arkham (PS4/Xbox) - contains remastered graphics unavailable on PC.
* Diablo III (PS4/Xbox) - contains gamepad controls which makes the game more enjoyable.
* Dragon Age: Origins (PS3/Xbox) - again, has exclusive gamepad controls, which I enjoy more for this genre.
* Starlink: Battle for Atlus (Switch) - contains Starfox scenarios which are coincidently the most interesting story missions.

* Chrono Trigger DS (NDS) - Has more features than the PC port.
* Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition HD (all 3 main consoles) - is complete and has gamepad controls on the three main consoles. There is an odd PC release only in the Microsoft Store that acts like the mobile game (mouse point and click) and the chapters need to be bought separately.
* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (Xbox/Switch) - Gamepad controls again. Bioware and Aspyr can't be bothered to mod the controls into the PC version of Kotor1, even though they did this for Kotor2.",Elranzer,34,2,0.52

Most of the games can be played on their successor consoles, with backwards compatibility on the PS5 and Series consoles and multiple ports with the Switch, and because of that the hardware isn't needed at all either. They don't really have much of a personality compared to the 7th gen or current one, with maybe the Wii U being an exception, and it doesn't seem like they will be a reason to hold onto them as more current gen consoles are available and ports are made for the older generation.

237,Help for Busy Dad and Husband Trying to Get Back Into Gaming,1192bzi,"Hello, first time poster here and I’m needing some help in making a decision. I have always been into console gaming since I was a kid, I owned everything from the N64 all the way up to the Xbox One including home consoles and portables. However ever since being a dad and being married it’s been extremely hard to fit it back into my life. I have never had an allegiance to any company and have had just as much fun with Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. I’ve also never dived into the world of PC gaming. 

I’ve recently been getting the itch to get back into gaming and want some suggestions on what my best option would be. My family and work obviously comes first which takes up most of my day but I do have an hour or two most days that’s free to enjoy some me time lol. Right now my daughters have a Nintendo Switch that I have picked up occasionally to play some Zelda BOTW and it’s brought back the itch to video games. 

Important note, I’m mainly focused on single player games, I don’t see myself getting into online multiplayer much. I’ve always mainly played sports games and first person shooters, but want to broaden my options to see what else is out there. I also really like the idea of having a portability option (handheld or remote play) so I’m not taking up the tv, or isolated to myself too much. So here’s the options I’m looking at.

1.) Xbox Series X: I owned one for a couple months last year, but never got a chance to play it much before selling it. I still have over a year of Game Pass Ultimate left so I’m thinking about this being the most financially smart to get again since many games would be free to me until summer of next year. I never really got into any of the Xbox exclusives at all, so I am more likely to just stick to 3rd party games here. The Xbox controller is my favorite by far.

2.) PS5: I love the exclusives PlayStation has, and have always wanted to go back and play the entire God of War Series as well as some other exclusives. I would have to get PS Plus and some games to get up and running. In the past I always tended to get more time out of my PlayStations than my Xbox’s 

3.) Nintendo Switch OLED: First of all, I LOVE the portability and the option to take it with me on the go or play docked when I can. My daughters already have a switch with some games and this could allow me to play with them and save money by sharing the games with that system. Outside of BOTW and maybe Mario and Monster Hunter, I don’t know how many game options the switch really has that appeals to me. Plus, it’s a 6 year old system at this point.

4.) PC Gaming: Like I said, I’ve never gotten into PC gaming, but it looks fun! The game selection is kind of like the best of both worlds. It would be fun to emulate and upgrade the system over time. However it doesn’t seem like it has as good of options for remote play as the Xbox or PS5 so I’d be glued to the desk most of the time. I like the idea of mod options too for games.

5.) Steam Deck: Portability king! I’d get to take all my games with me and I could play anything from old Gameboy, GBA, PSP, PS2 games to modern AAA games and even Nintendo. However the fidelity won’t even be close to Xbox, PS5, or PC. Seems to not have the best options for docked gaming so it would be primarily on the go or handheld only. Seems to not be as future proof over the next 2-3 years.

I’m stuck between the 5 options and just want the option that’s going to allow me the best experience for the precious few moments I get throughout the week to game. What are some pointers/suggestions y’all have? Thank you so much!",stevtown,36,3,0.57

However after the 3rd time of having to do this it then told me my save had been corrupted and when I loaded the game I had lost a load of my process. I had to repeat an hour or so of gameplay to get back to where I was. 

So when a save file corrupts, how much save does it remove? If you successfully save the same and turn the 3ds off, turn it back on and then reload successfully, does that essentially mean you’ve secured that save from ever being corrupted?",Mrstubbs91,1,1,0.66

I learned they just ported the PS3 version again.

For those who may not know, the original game on Gamecube ran at 60fps and for an action RPG, that is extremely important. This is a game that requires good timing with fighting game inputs. 30fps works, but why is it like this when the game ran on older hardware at 60?

There was a HD PS3 remaster released about 10 years ago which had the framerate locked at 30 and this is the version they simply ported onto PC and onto modern consoles recently (which is why I hesitate to call it a true remaster since most of the remaster work was done in that old PS3 version).

250,[Recommendation Request] - RPG with a lot of build/item customization and satisfying/skillful grinding.,1192awp,"Games that have gotten close:

* Horizon Zero Dawn
   * \+ Very fun/skillful grind (you can grind faster the better you become at the combat).
   * \~ A decent amount of build/customization (the skills feel very valuable. Fun to pick next skill) (wish there was more customization to be done to the weapons/armor).
   * \- Grinding doesn't really benefit you (I like that you can get rarity drops, but after the first few, you don't really have any uses for even the most rare drops).
* Elden Ring
   * \+ Very fun/skillful grind (see above).
   * \~ Decent amount of customization (I wish the weapon improvements and skills were a little more complex and had more options).
   * \+ Grinding helps you level up, which is consequential. But, the loot dropped seems to all have the same stats as others in its weapon class/type. There isn't a lot of reason to grind for loot. 
* Skyrim
   * \- Grinding/Combat doesn't require a lot of skill. Combat is not very deep.
   * \+ Tons of customization. (I love all the different types of metal, plus the ability to improve via sharpening. Enchantments add a whole other layer). Skill tree is very fun to navigate and plan out. Potions add even more customization.
   * \+ Mod add even more customization for enchantments, metal types, and skill tree. 
   * \+ Grinding gives you stuff you can sell and good loot, so it seems worth it.
* Zelda - Breath of the wild
   * \+ Grinding/Combat is satisfying (even if it's not super skillful)
   * \- Not as much customization as I'd like.
   * \+ Grinding gives you weapons which is valuable since everything breaks.
* The Witcher III
   * \+ Grinding/Combat is skillfull
   * \~ Good amount of customization in builds. But, I wish there were more ways to customize items.
* Minecraft
   * \- Mining and combat are very boring
   * \~ Enchantments are kinda fun
   * \+ Mods add a lot of depth
   * \+ Grinding really benefits you with resources.

So, I am gonna preface this by saying: I am not a huge fan of soulslikes. I feel like the learning curve is too steep, the stories are basically non-existent and the gameplay feels unrewarding as the enemies always respawn. I've tried a few times to get into them but haven't been able to get into the gameplay loop.

Seeing as many sources are citing it as the one of the best games of the past few years I really want to enjoy it. When I first played ME1 I thought it was really crap and clunky but then I restarted the game as a Soldier rather than an Adept the game became more intuitive and more fun. I've now completed it using every class.

Please can I have some tips on how to make the game more enjoyable (maybe more accessible?) for my first playthrough, so I can enjoy what *should* be a fantastic game?

292,I figured out why video games aren't fun anymore,118hisb,"Upfront, this is not another worthless think piece about micro-transactions, loot boxes, battle passes, games as a service, day one DLC, ""wokeness"", product integration, buggy/broken launches, or any of the common culprits that have been talked about to death. If anything, I don't think any of those problems have made games less fun. And let me preface this by saying I think games are LESS FUN. Not too samey, not poorly made, but simply less enjoyable.

The culprit is us. And I'm not talking about nostalgia necessarily. I'm talking about the way we approach video games now. Bear in mind this idea does not apply to every person, nor does it apply to every game. I'm specifically referring to long time gamers who have been playing since they were children or young adults who truly feel video games used to be a lot more fun.

It may seem strange objectively considering how far game design has come since the 80's. Better graphics, bigger games, a higher level of immersion, mechanics simply not possible on old machines. But I'd be willing to bet gamers in their 40's had more fun playing Super Mario Bros than most games today, and it's not just nostalgia.

Like anyone subscribed here, I love video games. Not only that, I love all video games. Sports games, RPGS, FPS, RTS, MOBA, MMORPG, hero shooters, team shooters, rhythm games, soulslike, roguelike, artsy fartsy games, shmups, fighting games, racing, platformers, visual novels, meta games, arcade games, open world, retro, simulations, VR. Brutally hard or quite relaxing. Fiercely artistic, or pure gameplay. I study the history of games, companies, developers. The evolution of genres, of franchises. As they say in wrestling, I am a student of the game. But about 2 weeks ago I just about hated video games.

As a student of the game, one of my only hobbies was video games, and that's where all my disposable income went. I loved all the new and interesting games coming out, but I didn't have the motivation to play them. I struggled and fought with configurations to make myself play more games. Only retro 80s games, only fighting games, only my backlog, only shmups. I was absolutely miserable. This continued for some time as I slowly built a backlog approaching 100 games. And when I say backlog, I don't mean wishlist. Your wishlist is not a backlog, it's a wishlist. This is my current backlog of games I own but have never touched

Lotta games, right? Some of the best games currently available, but no motivation to touch them. The kind of library I could only dream of as a kid. I needed to change something. I knew for months I had too many games (550+ switch games at the time of this writing) and the selection was making miserable. I had dabbled in Xbox gamepass a few times, and despite the amazing library of games, I never kept it longer than a month. I didn't like having that many choices.

I turned to pure retro games. Not arcade archives, but the games I grew up with, the ones I knew were fun. Now there are many people who love playing and collecting retro games, but I'm sure there are many of you who have returned to the games of your youth and found out they just weren't that fun anymore. The first gen pokemon games, banjo kazooie, sonic 1, these games don't hold up as well as I wanted them to. But I went back, and holy crap are retro games expensive.

I could have went down the emulation route as I already had a modded Vita, but I didn't want a butt load of even more games. But then I remembered I had a 3DS buried somewhere. I dug it up. Three years of not touching it, and it still had a charge. I had two games for it: Pokemon Silver and Bejeweled Twist. Not a great start. Not only that, the eshop was closing.

I found a way to add money to my account and decided to do some shopping. I got sonic 2 for game gear, the first game I ever owned. I got starfox, I remembered playing it and replaying it constantly as a kid. I got oracle of ages, one of the retro games I always wanted but never played, I got streets of rage 2 3D, I got Super Mario Bros 3, a game I heard many people swear by but I could never stay interested in, and I got super street fighter 4 for $5, finally a modern street fighter game. Later I would  get kirby superstars ultra for DS, and just recently ghosts n goblins. And that was my library. 10 games, nothing more.

I put my switch away and vowed to only play my 3ds. Now it sounds like I would get bored immediately. Not exactly an all star lineup. Pokemon Silver is absolutely archaic. Star Fox is fun but short and easy. Street Fighter on handheld? Super Mario Bros 3 was promising, as was Oracle of Ages. Streets of Rage is fun once, but you need friends to truly enjoy it.

But I persisted. I played a few hours a night. Beat street fighter arcade, actually beat pokemon silver completely to my shock as I have only finished one JRPG ever before that, beat streets of rage, and beat star fox. After beating these games, you know what I did? I replayed them. And that's the secret.

I'm sure there are exceptions for many people and many games, but I believe a significant portion of us no longer indulge video games. We binge a game as fast as possible, beat it and move on. If we don't like a game we quit and move onto the next one. It's so easy. People complain about Overwatch 2, a free Triple A game with no loot boxes, where all characters and maps are free, doesn't have loot boxes anymore instead of just enjoying the game. I can remember a time in high school playing Halo 3 8 hours a night and never once complaining about dlc maps. It was just fun to play.

People are so worried about these modern gaming problems, and they are problems that should be addressed, but they don't stop video games from being fun. If you can't enjoy Battlefront without Darth Vader, that's a you problem. If you can't enjoy Overwatch without a skin you won't even see 90% of the time, the problem is you, not the gameplay.

I would suggest to the many people who have lost their love of videogames to put themselves in a position where you only have 10 video games or less. Pick a decent variety. Different genres, different generations. No gamepasses or subscriptions. Pick 10 games and just play those and nothing else. You'd be surprised at what happens. The games are more fun. You learn more about them. Playing Mario Bros 3 for the tenth time, I'm still finding little secrets. Playing street fighter 4, I'm learning so much about the mechanics. Even in games like Streets of Rage I'm learning little techniques like dash attacks and back attacks, flying elbows.

The reason we don't enjoy games anymore is because we don't indulge games anymore. When you were a kid, you had a set amount of games, and until you got a job, you had no control over the size of your library. You played the games you had and you had fun because you didn't have a choice. There wasn't a possible better game waiting if you got frustrated. You were stuck with this game and needed to figure it out. I legitmately think Pokemon Sword and Shield is ten times better than Gold and Silver. The graphics, the dungeons, the open world you can see what pokemon you're about to fight, the animations, the massive selection of catchable pokemon, the move pool, the progression system, the massive world. Gold and silver is ancient, but when you don't have other options, you indulge the game more. You explore more, talk to more NPCs, spend more time in areas.

Trust me when I say video games are still fun, you just need to limit your options and indulge just a few games instead of lightly tasting dozens of games. There is a solution to gamer fatigue.

Or the gradual murder of Overwatch.

But... what's the point? Like I don't get the appeal to real world sports because you could just play the game, but maybe not everyone is physically able to do it, right? Gaming I don't get the appeal at all, since it's not really a skill being displayed, it's just numbers competing against one another, and you could 100% go play the game yourself if you wanted to, as barring extreme circumstances there's not much keeping you from doing so.

301,System Freezing and Crashing Randomly,118nwbf,"Hey guys, I need help! I built my PC back in 2022 October with no GPU using only the iGPU, everything was working fine for a few weeks but suddenly after 6-7 weeks may be, I started noticing random system halts, black screens & restarting issues, twice or more times a week. I was using windows 10 (Pirated Version) back than I thought it was a windows issue, I reinstalled it but issue remained. I did some research which lead me to viewing reliability history and there were some errors of window COM.APPs Update failed, other than this error there was no issue what so ever. No Heat up issue no RAM issue as I Stress tested everything and my system never crashed, After a while this started happening more. **Now** I started testing more things out Like turning off my E-Cores and disabling XMP, lowering RAM Speeds, Updating Bios & updating Drivers yet nothing solved this issue. after awhile suddenly my NVMe died on me, I had to switch to a Normal SSD (which I am using till date) with Window 11 Pro (Pirated Version) hoping that windows 11 might solve the issue maybe. 

On Windows 11 I saw this issue went away for a while on iGPU, rarely happening, then after a month I started using a RX 580 and **I noticed the issue went away completely which lead me to believe that it was an issue with my iGPU,** however unfortunately that RX 580 died preventing me from doing more research and testing (I was scammed by a seller as I bought a hard mined card with no info about its mining, yet there was an error in the windows reliability saying something about my PCI-E Lane error of this I have no idea as of what it meant hence I ignored it) and shifted back to iGPU. ANNND it came back again causing blacks screens and system halts, whenever my I shut my system down or it gets turned off due to a power outage, After which, I have turn the system on again after letting it rest for while, it has to freeze at least once at some point, it may happen when I am in game or just browsing it has no fixed time, just happens randomly. I even tried waiting for it to go away once. 

Now What happens when my system freezes, sometimes there is just a black screen sometime there are artifacts, RGB lights get stuck in a single color loop, stopping any effects applied to them, Keyboard & Mouse stop working only solution is to turn of the system from the power button or the PSU and start it again) after which the system works normally, nothing will crash the system now no matter what I do.

* Testing with GPU (The issue went away, but it did crash once or twice over the course of 2 months) 
* Turned off my E-Cores (still off to this day)
* Turned off XMP (Nothing Changed)
* Tried lower RAM Speeds
* Tried multiple copies of Windows (All Pirated thou :P)
* Tried using different monitors, Resolutions 
* Tried Gaming for 12-16 Hours straight on **iGPU** (No Crashes) 
* Tried not shutting the system down for more than a week, (Sometimes crashes, sometimes it doesn't

They currently really enjoy fortnite, but want to try out some other games too. 

One thing I’ve noticed however, is they really struggle with using both the move joystick and the aim joystick when they’re playing. Any advice on games that they could pick up to help them improve these motor skills? 

They get dizzy with first person povs, and while they play (and frequently win) a lot of fortnite, I’m very aware that the skill based matchmaking is incredible in that game and makes sure they are paired with equally skilled players. So preferably something that wouldn’t crush their spirits if they tried to pick it up. 

I’ve thought about introducing them to some story games like last of us cause I think they would love the plot, but I’m worried they might get confused with the crafting and survival horror elements of it.

Bullet for my Valentine. 

Aveneged Sevenfold. 

Funeral for a Friend.

Thrice. 

Just to name a few. 

And gameplay it's stacked. 

Do you want to speed through Not Rome or Not Detroit at 200+MPH/KPH wrecking everything in sight? 

It's got you. 

Do you want to rack up as much collateral damage in Crash Events? 

It's got you. 

Wanna flex your ""clean"" driving in Burning Laps? 

It's got you. 

Just wanna see who's the last poor SOB across the finish line? Oh boy the Eliminator events at higher ranks will show you how stressful 30 seconds can be. 

Because the AI drivers in this game are just as good as you. They're weaving through traffic taking the same gambles as you are with building boost and gambling on the high risk high reward ""shortcuts"" that are equally as the straightaways. 

At higher levels, they're coming for your throat out the gate. Survive and capitalize on their mistakes. Take them out and become the pack leader. 

And that's taking into account there are multiple versions of the tracks. There's the Long, Short, Reverse, and Standsrd tracks that mix up the turns and the locations of short cuts. 

And then there's the hidden take downs and challenges for each location. 

The game is packed with things to do and challenges to conquer and rides to unlock to wreck them expeditiously. 

The game also gives you a taste of the last tank on the World Tour with the Preview events. You're test driving the cars you're going to be competing against and oh boy are they beasts.

312,What do you dislike about gamers?,118l635,"We are all fellow gamers, and that's fine and dandy and all.  
But still, gamers are not a hive mind. We're all different,  
so it's inevitable that we may dislike each other for something.  
So I ask: is there anything you dislike about gamers or the gaming community?  
Every community surely has some bad apples.

Let me start off with an example: I personally can't stand  
the backseat gamer. I also have zero respect for bad winners and bullies in multiplayer games.  
I also wouldn't mind if certain people could allow me to subjectively dislike their precious game.

319,Rain World’s interesting world building doesn’t justify its purchase,118j8zc,"I really wanted to enjoy Rain World; I wanted to deny the critics who gave it low scores, but this game is nearly unplayable garbage. 

I’m fine with a game not holding you hand. I’m fine with a game being punishingly difficult. I’m fine with a narrative being obtuse. But typically, any game with these challenges that manages to work after all that toil should be at least REWARDING.

Rain World presents an enticingly artful presentation with infuriatingly inconsistent platforming mechanics and little to no sense of progression. I’ve been playing for at least 10 hours and the only thing that has happened is I’ve made it from Point A to Point H while intermittently being shown vague third draft concept art that suggests some kind of story that has absolutely no clear significance or emotional weight to it.

I’m about ready to give up after reaching the Shoreline and randomly dying while trying to swim through tunnels in which I’m drowning almost immediately after submerging for no explicable reason. I’ve nearly thrown my Switch across the room after drowning like this almost a half dozen times.

Not to mention that the frame rate drops during tricky platforming sections making already faulty mechanics all the more insufferable. Reviews suggest this isn’t just a problem with the power limits of the Switch, but across all platforms.

I suspect anybody defending this game are just desperately trying to justify their purchase. Yes, there are some interesting artistic choices being made, but without any meaningful significance or satisfying gameplay progression, Rain World is mostly just a nuisance that gives little reason for struggling through its flawed design and construction.",RogerPeculiar,12,1,0.5

I personally can't stand the first Dark Souls game.

381,Best option for a one-handed gamer on Xbox?,11820d1,"Hello, everyone! I might crosspost this on different subreddits but even if you’re just reading this, I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read this! Anyway, let’s get to it. So, for context, I had my first ever manic episode, (turns out I have bipolar whoops) which resulted in me, jumping in front of a train, causing me to lose one of my arms (and my right arm at that! (I’m right handed!!!!))so like anybody would be in the situation, I’ve been getting very depressed lately. Like it’s been BAD. However, I do know that throughout my whole life, video games have always put a smile on my face. so, my question is: what is the best way for a one-handed amputee like me to play Xbox games? ((btw I really like firstperson games)) I had an idea, but I’m not sure it would be the best. My idea is to get the Xbox adaptive controller in addition to getting Logitech’s extreme 3-D pro joystick. And then if things are working out great, then I could get some footpedals to use for the triggers. But is this really the best way? Are there not enough buttons(that I am able to press with one hand) on the logitech joystick? I have no clue, that’s why I’m making a Reddit post. Another thing that I would like to mention (this isn’t nearly as important as finding a controller that will work with my one hand) is that I absolutely love the half-life series. Half-Life 2 in particular is one of those games that gives me that warm and fuzzy feeling. I have a lot of nostalgia for it, but I also appreciate it for its genius game design. Anyway, the first time I played it was on a shitty ass gaming laptop that I insisted on getting when I was in middle school. (the fans are SO loud!) (I still have the laptop btw) so yeah, I would love playing Half-Life 2 again. However, I’m puzzled about the orange box. I have an Xbox series S, and also because I was playing games on my laptop for a while, I am not used to 30 fps. (seriously it’s a problem) (I downloaded red dead 2 one time and I couldn’t get past the frame rate) so yeah, the orange box is 30fps. Which is fine, but I know that it would be better if I played it on Steam. So now I’m thinking “is there a controller that could plug into both my Xbox and my old laptop that would (ideally) work for any game?”",mushroomatom,30,2,0.62

I want to play each origin in different ways, but man the plot scenes suck.

SPOILER

Not knocking the story. But my second on up playthroughs I just want to play the game. An example is from the time Dex shoots you in the head to when you wake up in the shower is really a 30+minute cut scene that forces you to occasionally hit buttons. It has not one but two scenes where you are forced to hold W to crawl across the floor in slow motion. And it includes a ME3 style dream kid vision where you walk towards a ghostly figure that keeps disappearing.

You really need to be allowed to skip all that, if it didn't require occasional button mashing I could at least go make a snack or clean up or exercise or something. But it just sucks. In my opinion.

I’m a gamer, grew up a gamer and love gaming. Now a mid 30’s fully grown adult I have more than enough financial resources to fully fund my relatively cheap hobby, but such a double edged sword life is, being an adult means i have minimal time to play games - or often too exhausted to play games. Switch is a god send, but between the PS5 and the Xbox, i’m seriously starting to doubt the need for both. I keep convincing myself that something like Banjo 4 will turn up on the Xbox that i “have to play”… but otherwise i barely touch the series X. That said, gamepass is such a good idea - and it introduced me to games like Outerwilds which now ranks as one of my fave games of all time. I play the PS5 more, but i’m starting to feel sony exclusives are all fluff and no game. Felt quite disappointed by Ragnarok… but i defo play the Ps5 more, but i’m not sure if this is simply because of familiarity.

I don’t need to get rid off one, but i stress over which console to buy a multiplat for and stress that i’m not playing one or the other nearly enough.

7. Spring Yard talk about a bad sonic stage bong things that just throw you everwhere annoyingly. The most unfair enemies, the way this stage can trap you in places where you are just done if that makes sense. Some of the landing especially where the spikes spin are flawed usualy knocking you off even if you do land. It does have an amazing boss fight and has great music and vibe C rank

6. Scrap brain I probaly should have put this lower due to no boss fight and zone 1 and 2 being hard in a very strictive way. However the 3rd level was amazing and really holds it and I did have some fun I just think it was designed in a sad way not exciting. However it was a treat. Just 3rd stage carries it. C rank

5. Green Hill wow what a treat and lots of vibrants and good work put into this stage it is a treat I really do love this stage. My only issue is the zones are way to easy. A rank

4. Final Zone well it has an amazing unique boss concept and takes a lot of skill it is satisfying and I really did love it. A rank

3. labrynith I was suprised some of the best enemies started here. Watching your bubble intake while tryna reach certain areas to get out I loved a lot. How fair this zone was not too easy not too hard, the best enemies tryna avoid spikes and other things in slow mo omg I loved it. However, I hope this gets no hate but the 3rd stage was pretty below par. A rank

2. Starlight you wanna talk about a stage that feels fast like sonic, While actually taking skill, and having an amazing boss battle and a great vibe and music that is starlight zone a pure perfection of a zone when it comes to a sonic feel. Every single piece of this stage is amazing. S rank

Marble Zone omg it is amazing. Talk about a masterpiece. A stage where you have to earn speed and momentum. I do not want to get hate with the community with what I am about to say marble zone is not slow may be some slow parts but its all about the skill you have to be fast speed is not goven to you. I love the enemies here and it feels like some type of cool dungeon and landing on those really tiny platforms is great I love how you have to be cautious but fast at the same time its not mindless at all. I love the land parts too and avoiding the flames and hoping the land does not fall off . This is a masterpiece of a stage too. S rank

My opinion of sonic 1 it is among my new top 20 games of all time I love it. I think it is underrated with people saying only greenhill is good and the rest are meh. It may not all have fast zones but I feel its best that in most of these stages you have to earn your speed. I think its such a phenomenal game.

413,The stupid non-issue with character models recently,117vg3r,"So this post is inspired by the recent conversations regarding character models in games, particularly how characters in remakes, original IPs, and the like have seemingly gotten 'older looking'. Now for 90% of us this isn't an issue and isn't even something worth noticing. But for the 10% that do have an issue, allow me to explain something to you. We were told this was going to be a thing years ago with the Spider Man remaster changing Peter's face. When asked why did they do that, Insomniac explained that the new face model was easy to 'transplant' onto Yuri Lowenthal's facial performance as the new face model shares a closer resemblance to Yuri than the original had.

Now behold, in the year 2023 where games are releasing with character models that resemble the people who play them, and people are upset, thinking they've been 'aged up'. The most recent example being Nicole in the dead space remake, who is just straight up Tanya Clarke.

To the people bothered by this 'issue', just know that it's not going away as it's literally just technology doing its job and it's easier for devs to let it do its thing rather than try to struggle with remapping a facial performance onto a model where the geometry/data doesn't fit.",johngold14,2,0,0.42

429,Some people give me crap for not liking the Dark Souls series.,117s3je,"I've caught some flak recently for not liking the Dark Souls franchise, citing the difficulty as the deciding factor. It also boils down to me as a person. When I get frustrated, I get angry, and when I get angry, I will sometimes throw or hit things. One of the things I do a lot when I get frustrated is hit my hands together or hit my legs hard enough to leave bruises. I do that due to psychological trauma and to prevent others from getting hurt. I can also become loud, and, living with my parents until I go off to college, I get told to keep it down.

Another reason I cite for not liking them is part of the second reason I cited, throwing things when angry and frustrated. I have thrown controllers before, even broken one. I've seen firsthand the horror stories of what happens when someone gets too frustrated, TVs in shambles, controller's shattered, and even consoles and PCs ruined beyond repair. I finally have a good controller, an adequate TV, and a decent console and adequate laptop. I also don't have the extra cash to shell out for a new TV or good controller every couple months, either.

I've been told that what I do when frustrated is a personal problem and I should fix myself. I'm finally happy with myself and I'm not gonna try to ""fix a problem"" that doesn't affect anyone but myself. I've also been told the deaths are supposed to be ""funny"" or that the point of the Dark Souls games is to ""overcome challenges,"" despite hundreds, if not thousands of documentations of people breaking things in frustration. Also, everyone finds different things funny. What I find funny will most definitely not be funny to everyone on here.

Lastly, I've been in situations where I've taken my frustrations out on others, never physically, but definitely verbally. I've gotten significantly better, as I have turned to what I do now. While it is not ideal, no one else is truly affected by my actions while frustrated as of now.",antroxdemonator,88,0,0.33
430,Controversial: GTA5 is better than GTA4,117s0xt,"I’ve played both games when they released, and after playing 5 a few times I went back to 4. It’s a good game no doubt, but to me 5 is much better. I’ll go through my reasons why. 

- The graphics in 5 are much better, with a lot more happening on screen (understand that the dark colours in 4 was fitting for the theme but this doesn’t make it better)
- I felt the world in 5 was much better and had way more detail. Liberty City is big but what they did with Los Santos and the outback land was incredible 
- The missions in 5 are so much more fun and very diverse. There were so many different things to do and so many different themes. You’re shooting out in the hood, there’s family involved missions, missions in the dirt, flying planes, flying out of them, going underwater, so much more. 
- The cars are better in 5 and the good cars are readily available for you
- I was not a fan of the physics in 4 at all. Everyone keeps saying 4 had better physics, I just don’t see it. I didn’t enjoy the rag doll physics at all. Everything just feels like a drag, you really had to pull to get moving, and it was so slow. Everything felt more instant in 5. 
- Mission Checkpoints - there are none in 4
- I enjoyed the story in both, I liked in 5 that you have accessibility to more than just one character, each which had their own story so that was good, and it also was a lot funnier too! 

So these are my reasons. I can’t see how 4 can be better than 5, but happy to hear your thoughts on how.",onelove7866,31,0,0.24

434,Should digital copies be sold for the same price as it’s physical counterpart?,117r68y,"Back in the day, physical games were expensive due to how pricey it was to make and ship cartridges.
Over time, things got cheaper and games became easier to reproduce and distribute. 
In todays market, one can simply download the game straight into the console, eliminating the previous process mentioned earlier. 
So my question is, why are companies like Nintendo and Sony charging full price for the digital versions? 

I bring this up because I recently saw Nintendo offering a “voucher for two games” for the price tag of $100 plus taxes and fees as a member exclusive. But after taking into consideration the premium I pay to be a member, it would actually be cheaper to go out and get the physical copies. 

Then I saw the new Zelda title was up for pre-order… for the same price as its physical copy, an outrages $70+ taxes and fees. 
I’ve always been a physical copy kind of guy but recently I’ve been looking into downloading digital software to preserve my physical copies, but I really don’t want to pay the same price twice.

So I'm not an RPG master but I loved for example the Mass Effect and the Final Fantasy series, and I know KOTOR is a huge hit on the RPG scene. My question is, what was the first game ever made that at the time had a similar draw to it like Mass Effect. What was the 80s equivalent of a Mass Effect game? Great story, great characters, great gameplay. Now of course, all great for the time it was released. Are there any examples?

It's hard for me to grasp that there were any deep and epic RPG games made during this era, but I'm probably biased since I was born 1994. My first experience with anything similar to this was Heroes Might and Magic 2 and 3.

Having put many years into WoW and other MMOs as I've aged - I've kind of fallen out of favor with them because they have difficulties bridging the gap of ""old-feeling"" and ""modern"" with this odd stuck in the middle ground battle between Tab Target vs Action Combat and often it becomes a jumbled mess.   


Instead I got to thinking after the D4 BETA Announcement and how much I loved the world and story of Arcane that RIOT should consider making an ARPG - they already have the general perspective in League of Isometric combat, the world building is done, and they just need to make fluid combat and tons of loot. But I'd feel much more involved exploring the world in an ARPG that I would doing it in an MMORPG.   


It also would be a breadth of fresh air from the same genre defining ""hellscape"" setting of both Diablo and PoE and we could visit continents, cities, forests, lush environments, deep space/voids, beautiful areas and dark areas.

454,Which is the hardest Boss you fought RELATIVE to its placement in the game?,117m009,"I will start, so to better clarify what I mean:

1st Place - **Father Gascoigne** \[Bloodborne\]

The most ridiculous boss I ever had to fight and soured the entire Bloodborne experience so much for me, I eventually left the game unfinished. This is the first boss (!) in the entire game (minus the Cleric Beast, depends). He could've been the final boss and I wouldn't even have raised an eyebrow. The AI has major problems maneuvering in the arena and even cheesing him with a stuck asset doesn't matter because most of his attacks are one-shots. The parry is very unreliable and sometimes triggers audibly but not technically. The animation-crunching to immitate ""combos"" is often sloppy and his blunderbuss has like 10 frames to react to. Entering his Werewolf phase opens up the old Smough trickbook: Stagger the player with a single attack and finish up with a one hit-kill when the player's asset is active again.

People have to understand: I am a Souls-veteran, but many new players might not have figured out how to even level-up at this point! I guess this is all due to the immense content-crunch of the game. Its technical state is atrocious and has the least content of all the From-games.

2nd Place - **The Ogre** \[Sekiro\]

It is just too early to switch things up this much. Many of the boss' attacks can not be properly blocked, in a game where you can block basically *anything* now, in contrast to Dark Souls. His wrestling grapples are far too fast for one-hit-kill attacks and not a proper punishment for failing to evade them. This is also one of the rare bosses you basically can't exhaust but have to completely deplete its health bars. This is basically the first major boss and already switches up the general formula 90% of all bosses follow. This would've been a far more fitting appearance in vicinity to Ashina Castle.

Like with Gascoigne and his Music Box, they tried to rectify this with the Ogre being ""weak"" to the Flame Vent - but its usage makes next to no difference in practice.

3rd Place - **Iudex Gundyr** \[Dark Souls III\]

By far not as bad as the other two. Its damage output has been lowered just enough to make this acceptable. But the complexity of Gundyr's moves far surpasses next to all other bosses in the entire base game. That is due to Gundyr being *the* secret endgame challenge of the game. So they basically tried to scale down Manus to a Level 1 boss. Especially when Gundyr ""pops"" the asset's scale and proportions are just out of whack and intelligible. Most players will trade damage for this encounter and it's just cheap and dumb and another one of those instances, where it completely soured the upcoming experience of the game.",FancyForky,16,2,0.64
455,What should I play after God of War? (Pc),117lzsk,"Recovering WoW player. 
Absolutely loved God of Wars pc port. I felt it had a good balance of story and free play and I was never bored and always excited to play more ASAP. The customization/rpg elements were just enough to make it feel like I had some control of my build but I never felt like I needed to do external research to make sense of anything.  The combat was fun, intuitive and the Ai archer was a nice mechanic to learn as I went. The art was beautiful! A nice balance between bright rich areas and dark bleak zones, without spending too much time in one or the other. Writing was good, though sometimes forced, and characters were believable and emotive( I was pretty familiar with the Norse myths going in).  I can’t wait for GOW:Ragnarok to come to pc, but in the mean time I need something else.

457,SBMM in most pvp games.,117lxod,"I originally posted this in r/halo. Bu I realize this kinda goes for every game nowadays. 

Whenever I bring up SBMM (skill based match making for the uninitiated) there's a lot of ""yOu JuSt WaNt To StOmP nOoBs""
types that defend SBMM every time. And I'm here to tell you that it's not about
protecting noobs. 
It's about riding that fine line to coax
out that dopamine response. Figuring out just how far it can push you before you'll quit, so it can let you smash
some other team, and get the biggest hit of dopamine.

Thing is, your dopamine receptors become
desensitized. That's why ""perfect"" games aren't fun all the time. Close matches are fun because they're supposed to be more rare. Being scheduled for a loss
or a win by the algorithm isn't natural. 

That's why most modern shooters have no longevity. Once you're dialed in, it's more or less the same sweatfest every single game. It utterly ruined playing with friends of different skill levels on top of that. And once you realize all of this, playing feels hollow. All that together is why halo
infinite peaked and dropped so hard so fast. That, lack of content, and desync.

If it was about real fun and longevity, they wouldn't force SBMM down your throat in anything other than ranked play. They especially wouldn't make your social
playlist MMR reflect your ranked MMR. They'd just let you choose whether to prioritize connection or skill.

Every halo, cod, or any other new IP that comes out just to be a 24/7 sweatfest no matter if your trash or a gamer god, is gonna peak and die off rather quickly. And I just wish, in vain although it may be, that developers would just bring back “fun” as the priority again.

14,shooters without hitmark and their sounds aren't as enjoyable,11vpzrq,"Am I alone in this? Any game without a hitmark after landing a shot just feels like am shooting sponges with a toy gun. Yes including Doom. Halo infinite also has a slightly underwhelming hitmark effect but it's there at least. I still enjoyed both games but it felt like they could've been better. 






I find COD MW2019 [hitmark sound](https://youtu.be/wz1PGK3gXXg) + gun recoil effect to be incredibly satisfying and was quite disappointed that it doesn't exist in the campaign. Overwatch headshot sound is iconic and incredibly satisfying too, the [crunch noise](https://youtu.be/3r1ILdlm750) when you land a headshot in Battlefield 5 (and the orange cracked skull you get on screen after landing it), or the hitmarker that gets bigger and bigger the more damage you deal in Battlefield 1, or the really loud [shield cracking sound in Fortnite](https://youtu.be/J0lQO26geIo).



&#x200B;



I get that the main purpose of hitmarkers is to give feedback during fast paced moments. NPCs are far more predictable than real players so you don't really need hitmarker for single player but still... It adds a lot to the experience imo and I don't find it immersion breaking unless you're playing completely with no HUD. 




Doom Eternal make enemies look and react like they've been shot to try and make it satisfying and some more realism focused games have real flesh sounds, blood splatter, wounds, etc, but it's not the same I want a satisfying click/ting/crunch :\",I9Qnl,12,0,0.28

Sam could have taken Rafe’s offer and left Nathan out of it, or he could have asked Nathan directly if he wanted to go after it.  Instead he lies to his gone-legit brother about it being a matter of life and death.  Potentially getting him killed or arrested.

Also, at the end when Sam ran off to get the treasure instead of getting away with everyone, he was either idiotic, or delusional.  The bad guys had the treasure, they would never have let him leave with it.  But he runs back seemingly just so his ego can tell himself he got to it first.

I’ve always seemed to have a surface level interest in a series for maybe 1-2 weeks where I’d be completely focused on a specific game or franchise.

I want an intense feeling of catching up, of being in the know. 

I sort of envy gamers who really know what they enjoy and are true to that. Like people who’ve played Mass Effect to death, or Resident Evil fans who can play every game blindfolded. It sounds nice to love something so much and love it not just for weeks but for years at a time.

There's literally nothing new about this game.

They stole a PoE system and Lost Arks open world but have pasted it on this clearly dated system. There's nothing interesting about my character. All of my abilities are old abilities. All of my gear looks the same as every other dungeon crawler D&D clone. Such a huge opportunity to create an inspired and fun game, only to pump out a flop.

Edit: Sorry everyone. I know how excited you are now that Diablo 2 has a fortnite battlepass. My apologies.",ChanThe4th,99,0,0.46

82,What character should be added to the next Smash Bros?,11u9o1a,"This is just something I’ve been thinking about, even though the next Smash game is probably years away. It’s always fun seeing who gets added to the roster and making predictions, both likely and complete wildcards, was a fun thing to speculate on while the game was active.

If I had to pick a character I both really want to see and think is incredibly likely to join the cast at some point, it would be Dante from Devil May Cry. It would be fun to see how they translate his mechanics and blend all his styles into a single moveset. Or maybe he can be a gimmick fighter where his down-B can cycle him between his styles and maybe change up his standing B. Could easily be one of the most versatile fighters in the roster and a blast to play. Another fairly likely pick for me would be either Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, or both.

I have two wildcards and no idea how they’d fight, but I want to see them regardless, even though it’ll probably never happen. The first one for me is Shantae. She will definitely never join the roster, but I will be there day one if it ever does. Another wildcard, albeit one that’s a little closer in the realm of possibility, would be some Guilty Gear representation. Since we already have Street Fighter, Tekken, and KoF, Mortal Kombat will probably be the next to get representation (and it’ll definitely be Scorpion or Sub Zero), but it would be amazing to see Sol Badguy, Ky Kiske, or (my favorite) May join the roster.

91,Tips for first person shooters with a controller,11u2myz,"Old-ass, lifelong PC gamer here.

I recently switched to mainly gaming on an Xbox Series X because, over the years, I developed a preference for gaming in my living room, on a couch, on a bigger screen. I'm just tired of sitting at my desk because it's kind of isolating... so I decided to take a break from it. Gaming on the couch is kind of ""freeing"". My wife (or my pets) can more easily hang out with me or sit with me while I game. My wife and I also play more co-op games now, and gaming on a 65'' screen is a nice change...

I consider myself a pretty decently ""skilled"" gamer. Played many competitive games throughout the years and I have usually no issues whatsoever beating most games on ""hard"" or ""very hard"" difficulties.

I'd say the games I excel the most at are ""Souls""-like games, Adventure/RPGs, platformers and, I USED to be good at first person shooters... that is, until I played one with a controller.

I am ***NOT*** here to start a PC/console argument. That's stupid. It's just that there are a lot of interesting FPS games on Xbox and no matter how much I try, I just can't seem to do it... I have trouble aiming. YES, I could probably easily just buy it on Steam and play on my PC instead, but I want to challenge myself. I want to become good with a controller. The upcoming game [Starfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfield_(video_game)) is also a reason I'm motivated to become prolific with a controller.

I wanted to know: Do most console FPS competitive players play with an ""Elite"": style controller with paddles and customizable thumbstick resistances and inputs? Is it ***necessary*** to invest in one of these to step up your game? Or are there high-level players who manage with a standard controller?

Any tips for options in the game? My main issue is really ***aiming***... After 30+ years of aiming with a mouse, I have a really hard time aiming with thumbsticks. Auto-aim options help a little but no much. I feel like there's something I must be doing wrong. Everything feels clunky and if I want to aim a particular part of the enemy's body, it seems impossible.

I'm honestly feeling a bit tempted to get the Steam Deck at its reduced price, going for about 360 excl. sales tax (which would probably bring it to around 380. The thing is, I don't know if this means it may get even cheaper in the future with other holiday sales, or if this is just a special occasion since it's the anniversary of its release, and may never happen again.

I will say that I do have about 500 games in my Steam library, over half of which are indies that would be Deck compatible, but I also have a couple Surface computers, which supposedly should be able to run them fine. Of course, when I do try to run even the simplest games, they cause my computers to overheat and occasionally freeze up.   I do also have a Switch and Playstation 4, which were gifts for finishing school, and I'd feel guilty leaving them behind since they were from my family. Also there are some nice looking exclusives for Nintendo on the horizon, but I'm not entirely sure how future proofed my libraries on either system would be for generations to come.

I just feel like I'd be gluttonous if I got a whole other system just for the sake of future proofing, especially since it sounds like there may be an improved hardware in a few years.

112,Game idea. What are your thoughts?,11tr077,"Some of my ideas about an MMORPG. Personally I think that this game should focus on players of other types of games and not just to hardcore MMORPG players. Anyways, here we go. (5-6 mins reading)

**Playstyle**

The game has an action combat style where key sequences lead to even better combos like mortal combat, nothing too difficult (since ppl can just use macros to do them) just as much to make combat feel smooth. Skills will be like a branch, for example E > E > 1 is different than E > E > 3 etc. Leveling gives you points that you use to go further to the branch of each skill. Balancing those skills is important so that ppl dont use the same skills repeatedly. In the end of a branch you will get something like a buff so pretty much you have to use all branches. Some parts of gear will buff some skills so you might want to use them more etc. I kindly hate metas and i think balancing skills can let ppl have their own playstyles instead of using the best one.


**Classes**

There will be a lot of classes (some of them will be locked by race). The combination of class and race will make a “hero”. Some heroes can be used by all races and some others due to lore will be locked to a single race. Pretty much if you are tired of the hero that you main, you can buy a new one (most likely it will be something like a weapon or a scroll) and a new tab will be available at your skill menu ( J key most likely 😂) where you can use the points to go further in the skill branches of the new hero (some skills will be locked because you have to master the hero to unlock them, most likely it will require you to do 1million damage with the previous skill or finish 100 npcs with that skill etc). Every new hero that will be released it will be available only by paying $$ until a newer hero get released 3-4 months later where the previous one will be available with ingame currency and goes on. I hate alt accounts or alt characters on mmo games because you either feel like you mastered your main one and want to try something new or you are forced to make one because of grind etc to feed main one and i think that in this way you dont have to make an alt except if you want to play that specific hero that is race locked. Last but not least, the holy trinity (tank, healer ,dps). I know that most ppl prefer dps classes but for those few ones who would like to play tank with every class possible and since heroes will be balanced in a way that everyone have a block, most classes will be able to tank but most likely not with the same difficulty. Healers will be linked with the tank and after dealing damage to boss a bar will get increased and healer will use that to heal. Some skills will use 20% of the bar while other skills will use the full bar etc. In the end of a skill branch all skills from 1-5 will become the same spell and if the player press 1 they will heal the 1st member of group, if they press 2 they will heal the 2nd member etc. For party heal and debuff removal there will be an aoe circle that player can see if everyone is inside and can be healed/blessed.


**PvE**

I hate when you have to reach endgame to engage with newer content or when a friend joins and they have to play 200 hours before you can play together. that being said there will be no endgame except raids

**Dungeons (5man, 20-30min long)**, there will be actual entrances to dungeons on world map but you will need something like an offering item that you have to use to enter, that been said, you wont be able to spam a single dungeon 100 times to progress on gear. Instead all dungeons will give what you need to progress depending on your level. In this way you play with older content too. So you may ask what if you run out of offering items? In this case, the dungeon finder window will open up and tell you to search for a random dungeon. What if you outlevel older dungeons? You actually wont, there will be a soft cap curve that even if you level higher the curve gets almost flat and you dont do any more damage. For example, you are lvl 100 and your friends are lvl 10, 34, 37, 43 and 46 respectively and you enter a 40lvl dungeon. Your lvls now will be (45, 35, 35, 37, 43 and 45 respectively) so pretty much a lower cap and higher cap of 5. In this way your lvl43 friend might do higher damage if you dont try your best. Lastly, i was also thinking about pve elo where dungeon gets more difficult depending on the group’s elo , so you still have fun doing dungeons you may did many times before.

**Raids (25man, 1.5h-2h long if done perfectly)**, as i said earlier raids will be endgame, that been said they will be locked behind story and some personal achievement that shows you are able to do raid’s mechanics such as clearing 10 times some difficult solo dungeon that have similar mechanics to the raid you want to enter (most ppl are afraid to take random to their raids because they feel like dealing with apes and might wipe them for hours long so they stick to their guilds)

world monster and bosses, nothing much to be said here, you get your reward based on your % you dealt


**PvP**

As i said earlier the combat system will be an improved version of combat system which is based on players skills only and gear wont matter. you can spam the block button like fighter style games but there is a window between them where enemy can engage, you can jump to avoid lower hits etc.. making pvp fast paced and increadible to watch. Anyways, after the first two chapter of story (tutorial) everyone can enter pvp matches and based on their elo they get similar elo enemies.

**Open world**, after each maintenance, game will ask each governor of a race to chose with which races he want peace and which war. In specific time of a day ppl can attack other races outside cities based on those decisions. (not so sure of open world pvp tbf, not my type.. might remove that)

**1v1** nothing to be said here, just an arena with balanced gears where only players’ skills matter

**5v5** (not sure if this should be in an arena as well or some other map like mobas or shooting games)

**50v50** (or more, depends if servers can handle) will be a siege type game where one team attacks and one defends.

**Monetization**

The game will be f2p, but people can buy monthly pass that gives them a sign near their name (like twitter blue 😂) and some other stuff but nothing special that would even make someone think its p2w. New heroes will be buyable till a newer one gets released (like i said in classes section). Skins and emotes on marketplace. And lastly dlcs. Those will be like prequels of movies, side stories that go deeper into lore and give you some skins etc. Nothing that you actually need to improve your gear.


**Story**

The game starts with a clip showing the lore of the game, not very long to be specific.. just some key events that happened in the past till the day you are born. In the first chapter you play as your actuall hero you created on character creation, in this chapter you learn about your class and going threw events that lead you to the 3rd chapter. In the second chapter, you play as kid version of your character till you reach the point you have grown to your actual created character, here you learn about the race you chose and what made you leave that place (in a race for example the village was destroyed, in some race you were recruited and in some other races you just stayed there) after 2nd chapter ends, a video plays and in the end it shows you were you started in 1st chapter. Those two chapters are something like a tutorial and they can be skipped at any time. In any case, in the 3rd chapter everyone is in the same city  and the story is the same for all races. There will be side stories where you learn more about a race and some events happened in the past (in the form of an expansion most likely). Mostly, you are not the main hero of the story (some chapter of story will focus on you as a being). Of course your actions have an impact to how story develops, but you are not “the chosen one” that will solve everything and bring balance to the force. There are beings that you cant beat alone even in endgame and some others who are blessed by gods etc whom power is even bigger etc (more about the story in the part where i explain the world). Anyways, the story is very important and it should be full of emotions. Some of your friends die, things dont go as planned, epic fights etc. Everything that makes a story stand out from the rest. No stupid quest like find some kid’s toy or collect 10x of those things that make no sense.


**World**

This game has ""everything"". A huge map that contains every region you can imagine, some races for example are: ancient Chinese, Egypt and Greece like, people who live in a snow place ( Vikings style), medieval, pirates , steampunk (a city like columbia from bioshock infinite, in this race gunner classes will be race locked), dwarfs (most likely a city in a mountain), elves and high elves (city on a huge tree), amazons (female muscle warriors like from futurama, 2-3 times bigger than other races), some little and cute race (like kirbies or yordles from lol), centaurs, half human half tiger/wolf race where you transform fully on human or animal, angles and demons (having wings and can fly slightly of ground instead of walking) and undead (skeletons, ghosts, spirits etc). As i said earlier about higher beings, there is a goddess of creation which had some children and they had theirs etc.. key points are also ascended city (like paradise), spirit realm/underworld/void and lastly the in-between (a place where you are judged by a higher being with an ancient scale. Some people are stuck there for centuries as a punishment from some god). There are also small maps for the steampunk city, in-between, ascended city and underworld. Lastly there is a single server for every region but it is divided into channels based on your ip address so that you can get the lowest ping or play with player with similar pink so you dont feel that you suck compared to others. Each channel has its own code e.g. #03939280. Of course you can change channels to join your friends but i guess that would need a loading screen.

121,The next generation of video games will have NPC's that can talk to you about anything for as long as you want. Then they'll become fully-interactive movies with any plot that you want.,11tovqg,"I've been messing around with ChatGPT for the past few weeks, and the thing is blowing my mind. I realized, obviously, that this technology can be slotted right into an RPG and allow you to talk to NPC's totally naturally about any topic (though I'm sure they'd be programmed to feign ignorance of things outside the game world). 

The first generation (which we may skip since the tech is developing so fast) may just have each NPC have a personality like ""bitter drunken fruit vendor,"" but the interaction will be on a totally new level. Imagine being able to go to a bar in Skyrim and just randomly talk to a guard about how he was trained and where he grew up. The game may forget the conversation right after, and it may have no effect on the game world, but just that blows my mind. It's obviously easy, I had ChatGPT simulate it for me already.

Then of course, the next generation will allow the conversations to effect the plot. The game will likely have enough memory to let what you say or hear change objectives sometimes in the story, and will know what each character said to you and what you said back.

After that, the games will obviously be able to generate any plot you want and let the plot fit your actions. ChatGPT can already make-up stories on the fly, the graphics engine needs only to be able to visualize what it says. It may take a few years, or maybe not at this rate.

I can definitely envision a future where there are posts on boards like ""How to turn Elders Scroll VII into a Skooma-dealing game, included map seed, which locations to visit and what to say to each NPC."" 

With deepfake technology, you'll even be able to include any actors who may agreed to appear in the game, in whatever roles you ask. Provided it's safe-for-work.

I think I still own this issue, but

1. I have no idea where it is.
2. I wouldn't know which issue it is.

However,  I've been wanting to find this image.  I called it a ""Poster/Ad""  because I am not sure which it was, but I'm leaning towards it being an  ad for renewing the subscription.  Either way, as I recall it was a  two-page spread with the caption, ""The Hits Just Keep On Coming!""  The  illustration was a band playing on stage, with Yoshi as the drummer and  Banjo and Conker on guitars/bass.  Link may or may not have been in the band, as I remember a picture of him with a guitar, but I'm not sure it was this one.  In the audience, Mario and Donkey  Kong were cheering.

Again I don't  remember the issue but some things can help narrow it down.  First, this  was made before Conker's WIP game got overhauled into *Bad Fur Day*,  causing NP to stop talking about it.  Second, while Banjo and Conker  might have been original art, I think the render of Yoshi was from *Yoshi's Story*.   *Banjo-Kazooie* was probably released by then, *Banjo-Tooie* was probably not.

I have a few myself;

• Quicker load times
• Autosave
• Preloading
• Cloud saves

But I think the one I take for granted the most is the ability to pause a game during a cutscene. My attention span has never been great - I never stick to one thing for too long before doing something else to break up any tedium I might experience. Cutscenes are hit and miss. Some get to the point, others drag on for long periods of time.

Being able to pause during cutscenes is a godsend. If I could combine it with another thing I love about modern games, it'd be that and being able to put my console to sleep, so that not only do I get to wake up my console another time, but I won't have to reload and rewatch a long cutscenes from the start. If it was two generations prior, I wouldn't be able to do that. It's especially handy when I have to go somewhere.

Perfect example. I had to go to the toilet, so I was able to pause the cutscene and go to the bathroom, and also write this post.

Around about 2013, I was a massive Tomb Raider fan who decided to trade my PS4 in for an Xbox One at the time so that i wouldn't have to wait to play Rise Of The Tomb Raider. As time went by, Microsoft implemented backwards compatibility and then Gamepass.

By then, i was pretty much sticking with Xbox for the foreseeable future. I managed to grab a Series X on release and was blown away by how seamless everything was integrated & accessible on the now current gen console. It was quite amazing playing so many older titles with FPS boosts, increased resolution, etc. 

Playstation had slightly caught my attention with the wealth of incredible exclusives that they had been releasing constantly. In the last two years or so, there hadn't been many great Xbox Exclusives besides Gears 5  & Hi-Fi Rush IMO. It slowly dawned on me that my Series X had just been primarily playing games from last gen and even earlier. I took the leap last week and swapped my series x for a PS5.

Having not played a sony console in almost a decade, i was absolutely blown away by the wealth of content available on PS+/Sony Gamepass what ever you want to call it & then they even dropped the brand new horzion game on it last week.  Checked out Spiderman (PS5 Version) and was blown away by the visuals. Even though the series x is more powerful, i don't think I've seen a game look that incredible in a long time.

Recently, i just checked out the Resident Evil 4 Demo and OMFG, the adaptive triggers, the inbuilt mic speaker for Leon's communication, and the haptic vibration feedback. 
The bloody controller has blown me away. I had no idea how next gen it would actually feel compared to the xbox controller.

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft)

&#x200B;

>On 15 September 2014, Microsoft announced a $2.5 billion deal to buy Mojang, along with the ownership of the Minecraft intellectual property.\[120\]\[121\]\[122\] The deal was suggested by Persson when he posted a tweet asking a corporation to buy his share of the game after receiving criticism for enforcing terms in the game's end-user license agreement (EULA), which had been present in the EULA in the prior three years.\[123\]\[124\]\[125\] According to Persson, Mojang CEO Carl Manneh received a call from a Microsoft executive shortly after the tweet, asking if Persson was serious about a deal. Mojang was also approached by other companies including Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts.\[125\] **The deal with Microsoft was arbitrated on 6 November 2014 and led to Persson becoming one of Forbes' ""World's Billionaires""**

&#x200B;

Even if you wanted to be really really fucking stupid about the whole thing the game was released on the system the same month as MS announced a desire to buy the IP.  Which means Mojang would have already had months to negotiate with Sony for the port and to put in the effort to build the port before MS even registered the desire to buy it.  Due to the fact they would need to work with Sony to get PS4 development kits and the assorted legal work needed to release a game on a console.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yet I keep seeing people claim that MS allowed the game on PS3/PS4. And even getting angry when you point out that they did not.  The only system that MS can be given credit for releasing the game on is Nintendo as the Switch and New 3DS versions of the game came out in 2017. Which was of course 3 years give or take a couple of months after they acquired the IP rights.

* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 & 2
* Tenchu: Stealth Assassin
* Metal Gear Solid 1-4
* Condemned: Criminal Origins & Bloodshot (esp in VR!)
* Splinter Cell
* Syphon Filter
* Silent Hill 1 & 2
* Jade Empire (one of old school Bioware's best games)
* Fear Effect (unique, adult PS1 game that was 4 discs lol)
* Dino Crisis

I can think of a few others I'd love to be remade but those are probably my top 10. Some others I'd love to see brought back or remade would be the Driver series, Black (one of the best shooters on Xbox/PS2 and way ahead of its time), NFS Underground 2, the Killzone series, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Def Jam: Fight for New York (probably the most fun I ever had playing a fighting game & the music was great), Fable series, Parasite Eve, Beyond Good & Evil (weren't we supposed to get a sequel ages ago?), Shenmue, Fight Night series, Star Wars: Jedi Outcast and The Force Unleashed, Half Life series, Prince of Persia, GTA: San Andreas/Vice City and Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. So those are all the games that I believe are deserving of being brought back into the current generation or deserve remakes of the original games, if not entirely new games. 

I can't even imagine how sick the Condemned games would be in VR, they're literally *perfect* for it; first person melee combat, horror, creepy af atmosphere and cool detective/investigation mechanics. And I can't imagine how amazing Dino Crisis or Fear Effect could be with today's graphics and tech. So I'm curious what everyone else thinks are games deserving of being remade, and could actually be successful. Like I'd love a remake of Indigo Prophecy or Wild 9 but I know they likely wouldn't be commercially successful so I didn't even put em on the list. I'm hoping this post blows up and some game devs see it and recognize how much money could be made with remakes of some of these titles.

So, by taking you away from a ""usually safe place"" i mean taking actions that you do regularly on a game and turning them into enemy encounters or something along the lines of that.

And i don't mean just jumpscares or ambushes (Like for example in The Last Of Us, you open lots of doors and sometimes opening a door triggers a staged scene or something like that, but i dont consider that as a ""safe place""), i mean things like crafting benches or save stations (also safe zones, but i cant think of any example of this), two examples are TLOU 2 and Dead Space 1, on TLOU 2, i was recently shown by a friend that if you start crafting at a certain crafting bench, you [get ambushed](https://youtu.be/i4ez9uGGRq4?t=70), and in Dead Space 1 (2008), a very similar thing happens, only that an enemy [falls behind you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOo1OtaLwA&ab_channel=Walkthrough%21Database) and its more of a jumpscare (with the music and all), so yeah, anyone know the name of this ""concept""? i just love it when they do stuff like this in games, it keeps the gameplay fresh and makes you keep an eye out the whole time, does anyone else agree with me or do you guys not really care for this kind of stuff?

PS: While looking for the Dead Space clip, i came across a [Dead Space Remake clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFhbqvxFNdA&ab_channel=Trathiel) which does something similar to both the clips i showed here but without any enemy interaction, just pure suspense, even the first comment says something along the lines of what im saying, ""... you feel so vulnerable in such a small area that you're so used to as a safe haven""",PastelLicuado,10,0,0.33

My buddies and I got into Fortnite after work during the pandemic and we have fallen off big time regarding consistently hopping on and playing together. We have been discussing that we are all ready for a new game and want something more relaxing. Over our discussion, we have concluded that we are looking for a 4-player campaign or pve type of game that we can enjoy casually and outside of the popular BR format. We tried sea of thieves this week and unfortunately I got super seasick lmfao. 

General Specifications:

\- Ideally cross platform, we have 2 on xbox, 1 on pc, and 1 on ps5

\- PvE or Campaign style game no BR

We have tossed around titles like Destiny 2 but my hesitation is that I've heard destiny 2 is an insane grind and can feel very repetitive. Minecraft also comes to mind but that would take some convincing as the guys are all 27+ and have never tried minecraft. Honestly if a game like Dragon Age Inquisition had a 4 player cross platform campaign that would be exactly what I think we would enjoy. Heck, we would be on 2K23 or FIFA right now running a group franchise or campaign right now if they had cross-platform.

Let me know if there are any games out there that would work. Any thoughts are appreciated",plow_poon,3,0,0.3
194,Games with cool and fun utility spells,11s3j2h,"To be clear, I mean OUT of combat utility.

One of my favorite things in gaming is when you unlock a spell or ability that expedites regular mundane activities or otherwise turns them into something fun that you look forward to. Stuff like all those ""filler"" spells in DnD that create feasts and clean the kitchen after, or create a temporary house or what have you. There's a lot of cool potential in these types of spells but I VERY rarely see games dabble in this type of thing, usually reserving magic as almost entirely combat/healing based.

Some examples

1. Forespoken - Say what you will about the game, but the Burrow spell was something I didn't know I needed in my games until I got it. They took it a step further and had it reduce other cooldowns as well making it useful in combat as well as outside of it. (for those who don't know, the spell creates vines that burrow away from the PC and will automatically collect all loot within a certain radius, and it reduces the cooldown of your other support spells proportionate to the amount of loot gathered).
2. Sun Haven - Has a ton of spells that expedite the farming/mining in the game, such as a spell that mines all rocks in an area around you, creates earthquakes to till the soil and rain clouds to water crops, all VERY cool, thematic and just feel good to use.
3. Skyrim WITH mods - Not gonna list them all, but base skyrim had the spell that guides you to your objective, which was basically useless given the compass, but MODDED skyrim added a tone of cool utility spells, check out Apocalypse and Ordinator's magic supplements for some cool stuff like that.

That's about all I can think of off the top of my head, so if anyone has any other suggestions for games with a decent amount of this type of thing please let me know!",shiek200,7,0,0.5

I'm not saying that there should be no blood and gore in videogames. And there's some games where that's not feasible to change. With this new wave of accessibility settings in games, I just wish there were more games with settings to turn off blood and gore.

232,Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – a love letter to the infinity engine,11raiic,"As I wrap up a 300-hour journey through these two games -- one that started in November last year, but in reality started years earlier -- I find myself drawn to comparisons to Baldur’s Gate (BG1) and Baldur’s Gate II (BG2). You have two games using a well-loved system (Pathfinder 1st edition) in a real-time with pause (RTWP) engine with a not quite isometric camera. In the first you have that feeling of fresh-faced adventure and wandering a world to encounter new challenges just like BG, while the sequel has a far more focused approach which pushes you ever forward, along with a chapter where the world opens up and a ton of side-quests appear in your log, just like BG2.

These games were subject to successful Kickstarter funding campaigns, though given their production positioning them as AA games, there was clearly publisher money involved at some point. I also wonder if those campaigns aren’t the reason for some of the problems I’ll get into.

I bounced off Kingmaker (KM) a number of times, spending almost 70 hours across multiple playthroughs which never made it past act 1. Yet I kept coming back as the game offers a compelling world to explore. I'd also heard great things about Wrath of the Righteous (WoTR), particularly its mythic path system, so wanted to play that.

I’ve been playing CRPGs for decades, all the way back to Bard’s Tale. Yet it was Bioware’s Baldur’s Gate that gave me an obsession for the genre, teaching me that the kind of games I loved were shared adventures with interesting characters. I got obsessed enough with that series that I worked on the [Ascension]( https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/quests/ascension/) mod for Throne of Bhaal because I wasn’t ready to let go. Since then, CRPGs have dominated my gaming, through companies like Bioware, Obsidian, CD Projekt RED, Harebrained Schemes, and Bethesda.

Both KM and WoTR are so clearly inspired by BG series everything that came out of the Infinity Engine. While the Pillars of Eternity games were presented as nostalgia tributes to the Infinity Engine games, these feel much closer to those games, both for good and bad, and a large part of that is the Pathfinder system.

# Pathfinder

I won’t pretend to be an expert in this, but Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) had a controversial 4th edition, with concern from fans that it was a gross simplification driven by trends in the online RPG space. This led to the Pathfinder system, a fork of AD&D 3.5, which has itself had its own controversy with its 2nd edition.

Both KM and WoTR are based on the 1st edition and are great examples as to why the system is nicknamed Mathfinder.

These games reflect my first experience with the system.

# My setup

I played KM as a neutral good Ranger at Challenging difficulty, and WoTR as a neutral (dipping in and out of evil) Slayer at Core difficulty. In KM I felt Challenging should be well suited to someone with Infinity Engine experience, and also someone who had played Act 1 multiple times now. I chose Core in WoTR as that was the minimal level for numerous achievements and therefore a level where I hoped the game would punish me for lazy play, but not require the kind of hardcore optimisation of higher difficulties.

If I had to pick an example of perfect difficulty, it would be Dragon Age Inquisition at Insane difficulty. Encounters would sometimes take a couple of tries, but almost never more than two, and after every loss I could always identify the mistake **I** had made, and correct it. Anything outside the difficulty curve was optional and clearly marked, and no big spikes hit me at any time. That game had its problems, but it has the best difficulty curve I've found in a CRPG.

# Overview

Kingmaker has a strong opening act, and it’s one of the reasons I kept coming back. It introduces all the systems, and not just the combat ones, but also how skills will be used for dialogue checks, and how decisions can have consequences. Part of what was so exciting about act 1 were the various party combinations you could emerge from the tutorial with, or how the order you visit things on the world map can change how encounters play out. I went to a tomb expecting a particular encounter, only to find because I’d done things in a different order the tomb was empty and looted. It keeps things fresh, and both games keep this feeling of consequence throughout, with decisions you made coming back to influence characters and events. The conclusion of one companion quest near the end of KM had their decision partly influenced by a decision I made in the tutorial. Amazing stuff.

Both games also have cool text adventure portions. If you're familiar with such from Pillars of Eternity it's just like that, but running for longer, and occurring far more regularly. Honestly, they make much better use of it than Pillars did. I was more of a fan of the presentation in KM, especially the line art style, but text adventures were always a welcome break in both.

These are games of high highs and low lows, really the extremes are kind of incredible. At their peak you’re partaking in some epic dialogues, seeing how decisions you made earlier have shaped this scene, or perhaps even caused it to happen whereas it won’t for other players. You know that the choices you make are having a huge impact on your game to come. At their lowest moments you’re stuck manging a not so mini mini-game or bashing your head against yet another difficulty spike.

WoTR might be one of the best choice & consequence games of all time. You have multiple “mythic paths”, and each has huge chunks of content that are unique to them. While this is a systems driven game, I actually made what felt like a suboptimal choice in taking the Demon mythic path, but felt like the right narrative choice for my adventure. That choice went on to shape every relationship I had, and completely changed the tone of my game. And that’s just one of six options available to you! It’s an unbelievable level of effort, in part made possible by the minimal voice acting and much heavier reliance on text.

However, the games have a few really big problems.

# Combat

This is where the slavish adherence to Pathfinder becomes a problem. It’s a system designed for tabletop sessions, where someone can just as viably create themselves a master of non-combat elements as combat. But these games are packed full of combat encounters, and non-combat skills are just something you max out across the party without a thought. So long as someone in the party knows religion you’re good, doesn’t matter who.

The issue with combat is that you make next to no interesting decisions. 49% of combat is build, which will often involve decisions made tens of hours ago, another 49% is pre-buffing, and then only 2% is decisions in combat. The way things play out is you carefully build characters to max key stats, build synergies, and get equipment that compliments all this. That’s really cool. But then you reach a map, you run through your pre-buff routine (and later on you’ll have 40-50 effects on each character), and then you lawn mower the map. Offensive spells are next to worthless because there are too many encounters, so you derive infinitely more value from buffs. Cleanse the map, then go back and loot everything when it doesn’t matter if the buffs run out.

Buffing was so critical in WoTR that I ended up installing [a mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/195) to do it at the press of a button as I was beginning to dread enemies just for the five minute buff routine it would entail. Pre-buffing is not something I’ve missed in my CRPGs.

# Encounter design

In KM act 1 you encounter a campsite where everyone is dead, but you can rest. In this region there are warring mites and kobolds. However, they weren’t a danger to me as I had convinced both I was their ally, hence I’m safe to rest. Hah! Nope, some death skull spawns and murders you. How were you supposed to know that would happen? That’s the neat part, you don’t! And the games are packed with stuff like this where you’re steamrolling some area, then a murder monster appears and slaps you down.

Another classic is 99% of the time when you spot a monster, the game then auto-pauses so you can do what you need to do, except for the 1% of the time where it instead cutscenes you into range before you can do anything. Thanks, game!

Among KM players, just hearing about the House at the Edge of Time is enough to trigger traumatic flashbacks. I have to agree with them, that is peak Owlcat bullshit.

There are two aspects which make all this more frustrating than it needs to be.

## The combat log is shit

At the start you’ll think the combat log is good. It shows die rolls, breaks them down, you can see where most stuff comes from. Nice. Then you start to level up, and it doesn’t scale at all. By the end of WoTR you’ll be generating hundreds of lines every round, and a round is six seconds long. Good luck finding out why your archer missed in the middle of all that.

The log is in desperate need of a filter, and without one it’s an unusable nightmare. In the final battle of WoTR I couldn’t find how to counter what the boss had done, because they cast multiple area-of-effect spells in a battle with 15 combatants, generating hundreds of entries, and that’s not including the hundreds I was generating simultaneously. In that final battle I also stumbled into the discovery that I had completely underestimated the power of a certain ability because delving into the log was such a nightmare I’d never noticed before.

It’s also not very accurate. At times you will see damage being assigned to someone who already died. Sometimes checks are just missing and it’s not clear why. Other times you will see some number that has no item or feat source, leading to you tearing your hair out trying to figure out why a companion is doing more damage than you thought they would. If all you know is their name you’ll have to trawl through 40 feats, 40 buffs, and 20 items to figure out which one is doing the thing.

The mechanics are also overwhelming. I’m not sure even the designers understand how it all fits together. Even at the end of my 300 hours I was discovering ways the system works I hadn’t known. Something I didn’t notice until late for example was that each ability applied on an attack isn’t handled as part of the weapon’s attack damage, and that this then leads to certain effects being exponentially useful because while you’re ostensibly applying them to the weapon, they get applied to each effect. Then perhaps you have something which causes certain attacks to happen multiple times. So now that 2d6 bonus you applied is suddenly 10d6. Nothing in the game will tell you this, you have to stumble across it in the logs, and this is just one example!

The log simply isn’t fit for purpose.

UI in general is a problem with the games. Playing without a mod which allows you to buff at the press of a button is like indulging in self-flagellation.

## Combat is too easy to prepare you for when it isn't

If you build well and always apply your buffs you should be able to get through most combats without having to step in. Maybe you adjust targeting order, or split the archers to take out the backline while your frontline holds up the enemy. But what this means is when the game throws some nightmare encounter at you you're slamming into a wall without the education to know how to scale it. This is on the critical path.

Just as bad was when an enemy appeared that required a completely different toolset to beat than anything else present, especially frustrating when it's bosses with immunities to everything you used to get through the dungeon up until this point. Even when you are in a position to change the party, or overhaul your spell set, it felt like a tedious slog rather than a meaningful challenge. The game never gives you any indication of what threat you’ll face at any location, so you always bring the 99% effective party and spell composition. KM isn’t as bad, as most of these types of encounters exist in their own area and so you leave and come back later, but WoTR loved to do this mid-dungeon. One dungeon locks you in, and if you brought the wrong party for its challenge, you better hope you’ve got an earlier save.

This was one of my biggest sources of frustration throughout both games.

There’s also the mess of turn-based versus RTWP. In KM a well-regarded mod was put out with a turn-based setup. It’s actually a much better way to get a handle on how combat is working than RTWP allows for, but is also completely unsuitable for a game of this scale. WoTR has turn-based built-in, and this leads to the Arcanum problem of how do you balance for both? You can’t. The best example of this are swarms, where in RTWP a bunch of tics or locusts are the deadlier than any demon lord, but in turn-based are absolutely no threat whatsoever. Owlcat need to pick their poison and balance around it, you shouldn’t be seeing posts recommend switching to turn-based to beat certain encounters. I am relieved to see that their next game, Rogue Trader, will be turn-based only.

# Slavish adherence to systems which don’t belong in a computer game

The encounter design necessitates quick save since you never know when you’re going to stumble into some murder encounter. However, quick save undermines other systems. If you failed to pick a lock you need to come back when you've increased your skills. Disarming a trap comes with the danger of triggering it. Except neither of these things are true because the game has quick save.

The real issue is that there is no reward for failure. Triggering a trap doesn’t lead to some new, interesting outcome, you just take a bunch of damage that will make things harder, and harder in this game usually just means longer. There’s no incentive to let such failures stand and you will save before every trap, every chest, and reload if you fail. There needs to be a better way, either through designing for failure, or switching to a Boolean system.

My favourite example is in WoTR if you fail certain skill checks then time passes. Time passes causes all your buffs to run out. Without those buffs you’re under-powered for the area. This necessitates a rest and then re-buff. Or are you simply going to reload your save from before the skill failure? There’s no reason to accept the failure. In tabletop this means the party has to adapt and the dungeon master adjusts the scenario accordingly, but in a computer game it’s just a waste of your time.

And it's odd, because the game does have some interesting failures. For example, at one point you might choose to renounce a mythic path for another, yet some third-party tries to stop you, leading to a skill check. Pass, and you change path, fail and you stick to your original. Neither route is wrong, so failure is perfectly acceptable and leads to an outcome that is both narratively and mechanically interesting. I want more of that, please.

# Dreadful not so mini games

Both games feature ill-advised strategic games that sit above the CRPG layer. Both serve as undesired interruptions to the cool CRPG you’re playing. KM’s is heavily reliant on die rolls you have little control over and almost necessitates quick load to avoid getting randomly screwed with failure leading to a spiral of doom as failure begets failure. WoTR’s is just a tedious chore and is what if Heroes of Might & Magic 3 (HOMM3) but shit, and I didn’t much like HOMM3 in the first place. Honestly, WoTR feels like it has the overland travel simply because KM did, despite the fact that there's very little to discover out there.

Both have the same issue where nothing on the strategic level really impacts the CRPG aspect, so it’s hard to care about any of it. The only times either work is when you get the more traditional throne room scene where you make key decisions via dialogue. These allow for cool character expression, both by yourself and your companions. It feels more like running a kingdom/crusade than anything that happens on the strategic map.

Had they been limited to assigning advisors and throne room scenes then they’d have been good, and indeed the way different advisors in KM can play out is cool, but generally these modes are just a massive time sink that represent a good 15% of your play time. You can’t ignore them either because you can lose the game in this mode, and at least in KM certain powerful items are tied to quest lines which are tied to this.

# A problem with endings

Sadly, both games share a problem, and that’s the ending. In recent years CRPGs have begun to understand the importance of the denouement, and CD Projekt RED is a prime example of this with both Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 having deeply satisfying send offs. Meanwhile, WoTR has one of the least satisfying and most jarring endings I’ve ever encountered, where the final boss fight concludes then you’re immediately dumped into some very short slides and the game ends.

Owlcat need to trim some of the fat from their games and scale back their plans. Both KM and WoTR are clearly running out of steam towards the end. In KM the maps you unlock near the end have far less locations to explore, while in WoTR the reactivity starts to fall apart with key events not being commented on by individuals who absolutely would have something to say. You can even sacrifice your life and your love interest won’t have a word to say about it.

For all the replayability of WoTR, I went from “can’t wait to experience this journey again” to “meh” because the destination is just that unsatisfying. Slides are a poor way of presenting an ending at the best of times, and this is one of the worst uses of them I’ve seen to date. It’s not only that it’s jarring, it’s that the slides are so slight. While it’s not Mass Effect 3 bad, it did leave me with a sort of empty feeling, and not in the good way an epic EPG can. WoTR is actually a step back from KM in this regard, which had more detail and reactivity in its slides, though both really need an epilogue piece.

Both games have secret endings, and while I don't know much about the WoTR one, I went into KM prepared. I did every quest, I completed every kingdom research item. The one time I could just feel I'd picked a bad dialogue option with the antagonist that was taking me off the path, I reloaded. Then, right at the end, I found I couldn't get the secret ending because 50 hours earlier a secret die roll had happened without me knowing and I'd failed a check. This is the Owlcat design philosophy in a nutshell, and makes me wonder why they combine this with such long games.

# Despite it all I love these games

It’s the unabashed ambition most of all. KM gives you that feeling of BG1 where you’re exploring the land, stumbling upon cool encounters. WoTR has some of the best choice & consequence stuff I’ve ever seen in a CRPG, and begs for you to replay it.

I love the mechanical stuff. It’s intimidating as hell, and I almost always stuck to single class, but figuring out how to try and optimise your build, put together cool synergies, and then see it tear through enemies, never gets old. Even as I came to the end of each game I was thinking how I’d do things differently next time.

My primary love for CRPGs though isn’t systems based, it’s narrative. I want a world packed with people I care about. It’s why I was along for the ride when Bioware started to trim the fat in the Mass Effect games, and why CD Projekt RED is my current favourite RPG company.

KM, despite being touted as a narrative CRPG is actually lighter than you might expect. The comparison to BG1 & BG2 earlier wasn’t an accident. It’s not BG1 light, but you can see in WoTR that Owlcat have gained more confidence and experience in putting this stuff together. The companions are more interesting, do more to defy expectations in their arcs, and the romance choices are far more interesting. I could do without my 160 hour CRPG allowing me to tank a romance through one bad dialogue choice, but Bioware didn’t master this overnight either. And the romances are a breath of fresh air if you found Bioware stuff fairly milquetoast.

I can't give Owlcat enough credit for their writing of evil characters. They're not treated as one-note, or cackling idiots, rather they have their own world views which are treated as seriously as anything else. A favourite of mine in WoTR is Regill, your Hellknight companion who embodies the philosophy of victory through discipline, and as he tells one character, ""The forces of good are not weak, it's just you."" He's labelled as lawful evil because of his philosophy, but he sees himself one of the good guys. And the game is packed with characters like this. And this equally applies to being evil yourself, where you can pursue paths of lust, or power, or ambition, or ""the greater good"", rather than just being a dick. I haven't had this much fun playing evil since Dragon Age Origins, and the warden who had yet to meet the demon he wouldn't do a deal with.

What I also loved is how much variability I had in party composition, especially in KM. Generally in a CRPG I lock in my party and it never changes, but here I had real options, and the game provided me with the equipment necessary to keep everyone viable. In KM I left one companion at a ford for a long time because I couldn’t be bothered to change up my party, yet by the end of the game they’d become a key part of my personal story and I felt a close, personal connection to them.

WoTR hits some incredible highs. When you’re standing before demon lords and gods and making choices that you know will shape the entire story to come, well that’s just CRPG heroin to me. The game hits these sorts of highs over and over and over again. So many epic moments, and I only wish it didn’t end in such a wet fart.

I know I dwelled far more on bad than the good, but ultimately if you enjoyed Infinity Engine games then you’re getting into something that is a natural evolution, while also keeping many of the flaws those games had too.

There has been much discussion over the years about wasted content, time spent making things a player will never see, and companies trying to avoid this. I'm glad Owlcat don't, because content I will never see is what allows me to have experienced *my* story rather than *the* story, and it makes the game mean so much more to me. The mistakes Owlcat make are also a reason for their strengths, because they haven't soaked in the prevailing wisdom of what you should and should not do, so why not make six completely different paths of the player? I'm glad of it, that someone out there is making this kind of game still.

I find myself with the realisation that Owlcat is the company Beamdog so desperately wanted to be.

# So which should you play?

WoTR is the better game, no two ways about it. The companions are better developed, and the writers are good at defying expectations in how an arc should play out. The mythic path system really lets you shape your own story, and critically it’s a much tighter story than KM’s episodic feel.

Yet I’d say KM is the better first game. WoTR has a more fleshed out tutorial, but it really doesn’t convey the stuff you need to know, and in the in-game encyclopaedia in both games are utter garbage, you will need to use Google. The enemies in WoTR require a better understanding of the systems, with all sorts of immunities and resistances among them. KM has more traditional CRPG monsters that act as you expect, and in one of the lone instances of resistances being important it dedicates multiple encounters and scenes to educating you on this. KM won’t Pathfinder you quite as hard as WoTR will, and WoTR also has a more brutal difficulty curve.

If you’re big on your CRPGs though, you should find time for both. Owlcat is a name that’s on the rise, and I will be buying anything they put out, or I will twelve months after they put it out. These are also very buggy games, even playing it more than a year after launch I didn’t get through a single WoTR session where I didn’t file a bug report. Maybe give it another year in the oven.

Whatever you play, crank up quick save and auto save slots to the maximum value, trust me.",Quitchy,3,2,0.54

Impressions generally seem to have the following common points-

\-Lots of weapon variety and customization.  
\-Combat feels good and is fun, but not the best first-person melee ever.  
\-FLESH system is the game's biggest innovation.  
\-Fighting basic zombies can get repetitive & encounter design isn't always great.  
\-World is small and surprisingly linear (even compared to the first game), but pretty to look at.  
\-Characters may have custom elements to their stories.  
\-Feels like a game from the 360/PS3 era in terms of design, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

Should be interesting to see how this game shakes out, especially compared to Dying Light 2, which was received less warmly by the community than the first overall. The game looks fun, but I'm most worried about the idea that each playable area is, as one preview put it, ""basically a linear corridor with some side paths,"" which sounds like a step down from even Dead Island 1's limited worldspaces.",GameShrink,39,14,0.7

Why can't game studios get past their angsty phase, and make games that are a little brighter, and have fun in the writing and presentation of the game? Like you can have serious elements to your  game without everything being super dark, and you can have combat without making every NPC sound like some psychopathic killer.

It  even goes down to art style and music: There isn't any ""fun"" music in most games, it's just super serious cinematic orchestra, and there isn't any kinda cartoony art, it's all gotta be ""realism"" and look/run like shit.

Why are game devs, and especially MMO devs, so edgy? It seems like the only games that weren't grimdark are from 30 years ago, with the VERY OCCASIONAL game like Hifi Rush that isn't extra edge at all times -- as far as MMOs go, the only ones I can think of that weren't edgy were Wildstar and Maplestory / Maplestory 2.

297,In defense of Preston Garvey [discussion],11pufp9,"Ok ok I know! Preston sucks! Everyone here agrees Preston Garvey sucks.

But let’s take a step back and see it from his shoes alright?

First he’s got a platoon he’s running with. A group called the minutemen. Military wannabes who just want to help the people however they can.

However little by little they’re outnumbered and picked off until Preston’s just left with:

- an old drug loving seer 

-two regular civilians who don’t really know anything about combat

- a mechanic

- and someone who lost their brother and also doesn’t know combat

So in this case Preston’s the only be who knows anything about combat. And then the player shows up and saves him and his group from a raider attack they had no way of getting out of on their own

Afterwards the player leads the group to a nice place to be safe.

And what does Garvey do? He doesn’t give up on what he believes in. He sticks to the minutemen by letting this new person who just saved them go out and help others in the wastelands while he sticks around and protects the friends he’s made. Why?

Well if you were him, what would you do?

-go out on your own with limited supplies and possibly get killed

Or

-send a new friend who’s a combat veteran off to help other people who are in need of it. (…. Nate’s the veteran. Nora’s just a tough cookie)

I know what I’d choose. I’d be like Garvey and stick close to my friends.

That is until that certain new general turns traitor and joins raiders! THAT EARNS A LASER TO THE FACE, SON!

Anyway yeah I think Garvey was just doing what he thought was best.


And in the end he got stuck on loop.

Poor guy.

Your character could summon minions similar to Pikmin, and the summons you selected would give your character different abilities. 

You could level up your character and the minions independently for stat and ability boosts. 

I can't remember if there were multiple main characters, but one he played as was male. 

One of the minions could be used as ""bombs.""

Levels could be played multiple times, and you received a score based on performance in the linear environments.

Sometimes when reviewing a game I will feel a game’s focus is not particularly about the gameplay, and then people will disagree and say games should be primarily about the gameplay and be confused about how I scored a game. RPGs are often a good example. Sometimes the gameplay is poor when taken alone, but the gameplay serves more as a means to provide a backdrop to the world, characters, story, and emotions it evokes that stick with you for years.  

Obviously a competitive multiplayer game will focus on the gameplay, but that just shows the variety of experiences videogames can provide.

In the year 2151, the world is under attack by the forces of Hell. Giant demons, led by the powerful Khan Maykr, have invaded Earth, and the only hope for humanity is the Armored Response Coalition (ARC), a group of elite soldiers who pilot giant mechs known as Titans.

The ARC is led by the tough-as-nails General Hayden, who has made it his mission to protect humanity from the demonic threat. But even with the Titans, the ARC is outnumbered and outgunned by the demonic horde.

That's when the Doom Slayer arrives. He's a mysterious warrior with unmatched combat skills and a reputation for taking down demons. The ARC is skeptical of him at first, but when they witness him in action, they realize that he might just be their best chance at stopping the demonic invasion.

Together, the Doom Slayer and the ARC launch a counterattack against the demons. They battle through city streets and underground tunnels, facing off against the hordes of hellspawn that stand in their way.

But the Doom Slayer has a secret weapon - the Crucible, a powerful sword that can cut through anything, including demons. With the Crucible in hand, the Doom Slayer leads the charge against the demons, carving a path of destruction through their ranks.

As they fight their way deeper into the heart of the demon invasion, they discover that the Khan Maykr is using an ancient machine known as the Icon of Sin to power her army. The ARC and the Doom Slayer know that they have to destroy the Icon of Sin if they have any hope of stopping the invasion.

In a final battle for the fate of humanity, the ARC unleashes their Titans against the demons while the Doom Slayer fights his way to the Icon of Sin. The battle is intense, and it looks like all is lost, but the Doom Slayer manages to destroy the Icon of Sin with the power of the Crucible.

The demons are defeated, and humanity is saved thanks to the bravery of the ARC and the unstoppable force that is the Doom Slayer.

Since I got in possession of a good PC with dual monitor setup, I can't stop playing games that doesn't require my full attention and watch YouTube videos or Twitch livestreams on my second monitor.

Lately, I've been playing a whole lot of Skyrim, Subnautica and Total War Warhammer while watching a playthrough of any of these 3 games at the same time and, if not, watching a random Twitch livestream.

This habit is so bad that I stopped playing God of War Ragnarok on PS5 mid-way through the game (even though I was completely enjoying it) to return to my PC.  

As I have my PC setup in my living room next to my TV, I told myself that I would buy an extra HDMI cable so that I can play my PC games on the TV with a controller, stuff like Dead Space Remake for example. I bought the HDMI cable but haven't done any of what I had planned.

To give more background, prior to having a dual monitor setup, I almost completely stopped playing video games to only watch Twitch livestreams. Now it's a bit better but I still wanna go a step further in defeating my addiction to video game playthroughs/livestreams.

Yes including Doom. Halo infinite also has a slightly underwhelming hitmark effect but it's there at least. I still enjoyed both games but it felt like they could've been better. 






I find COD MW2019 [hitmark sound](https://youtu.be/wz1PGK3gXXg) + gun recoil effect to be incredibly satisfying and was quite disappointed that it doesn't exist in the campaign. Overwatch headshot sound is iconic and incredibly satisfying too, the [crunch noise](https://youtu.be/3r1ILdlm750) when you land a headshot in Battlefield 5 (and the orange cracked skull you get on screen after landing it), or the hitmarker that gets bigger and bigger the more damage you deal in Battlefield 1, or the really loud [shield cracking sound in Fortnite](https://youtu.be/J0lQO26geIo).



&#x200B;



I get that the main purpose of hitmarkers is to give feedback during fast paced moments. NPCs are far more predictable than real players so you don't really need hitmarker for single player but still... It adds a lot to the experience imo and I don't find it immersion breaking unless you're playing completely with no HUD.

Sam could have taken Rafe’s offer and left Nathan out of it, or he could have asked Nathan directly if he wanted to go after it.  Instead he lies to his gone-legit brother about it being a matter of life and death.  Potentially getting him killed or arrested.

Also, at the end when Sam ran off to get the treasure instead of getting away with everyone, he was either idiotic, or delusional.  The bad guys had the treasure, they would never have let him leave with it.  But he runs back seemingly just so his ego can tell himself he got to it first.

I'd be moving to the US for this, which means I can't/don't want to take my current setup (PC + PS5) with me. The way I see it, this leaves me with 3 choices:

1. Buy a new PC there - which I'm not too keen on for the hassle tbh. I don't know if I'm gonna stay in the same city that I'm doing my masters in, and I can always buy something for now and build once in 3-4 years time once I have money there.
2. Buy a gaming laptop - I already have a MacBook which I'll likely be using for college due to the battery + portability. So investing $1500 or so on a laptop which I won't use much outside of gaming, I'm not entirely sure. But this does allow me to use my entire PC library + gamepass.
3. Buy a steam deck - I'm not sure this is good enough as a daily driver. The smaller screen and performance are also not the best parts, and I'm not sure about the longetivity. But it's cheap, and I've heard good things about it.

I definitely want to go with a PC like device instead of Xbox or PS. Right now I feel like a laptop is the best choice, but I'd love to hear your suggestions! Would love some recommendations too, my budget is about $1500, and I could do with saving as much money as I can.",JustMeSach,13,0,0.29

77,Confession: I envy people who can delve deeply into a single game or series,11uedze,"Ever since I was a kid, my attention span has been pretty bad (Diagnosed with ADHD just recently). I’ve always seemed to have a surface level interest in a series for maybe 1-2 weeks where I’d be completely focused on a specific game or franchise. Recently it’s been The Witcher 3, before it was the Mass Effect series, before it was immersive sims, etc. Then a few weeks pass and I feel FOMO about a new franchise. I want an intense feeling of catching up, of being in the know. 

I sort of envy gamers who really know what they enjoy and are true to that. Like people who’ve played Mass Effect to death, or Resident Evil fans who can play every game blindfolded. It sounds nice to love something so much and love it not just for weeks but for years at a time.

They stole a PoE system and Lost Arks open world but have pasted it on this clearly dated system. There's nothing interesting about my character. All of my abilities are old abilities.

82,What character should be added to the next Smash Bros?,11u9o1a,"This is just something I’ve been thinking about, even though the next Smash game is probably years away. It’s always fun seeing who gets added to the roster and making predictions, both likely and complete wildcards, was a fun thing to speculate on while the game was active.

If I had to pick a character I both really want to see and think is incredibly likely to join the cast at some point, it would be Dante from Devil May Cry. It would be fun to see how they translate his mechanics and blend all his styles into a single moveset. Or maybe he can be a gimmick fighter where his down-B can cycle him between his styles and maybe change up his standing B. Could easily be one of the most versatile fighters in the roster and a blast to play. Another fairly likely pick for me would be either Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, or both.

I have two wildcards and no idea how they’d fight, but I want to see them regardless, even though it’ll probably never happen. The first one for me is Shantae. She will definitely never join the roster, but I will be there day one if it ever does. Another wildcard, albeit one that’s a little closer in the realm of possibility, would be some Guilty Gear representation. Since we already have Street Fighter, Tekken, and KoF, Mortal Kombat will probably be the next to get representation (and it’ll definitely be Scorpion or Sub Zero), but it would be amazing to see Sol Badguy, Ky Kiske, or (my favorite) May join the roster.

91,Tips for first person shooters with a controller,11u2myz,"Old-ass, lifelong PC gamer here.

I recently switched to mainly gaming on an Xbox Series X because, over the years, I developed a preference for gaming in my living room, on a couch, on a bigger screen. I'm just tired of sitting at my desk because it's kind of isolating... so I decided to take a break from it. Gaming on the couch is kind of ""freeing"". My wife (or my pets) can more easily hang out with me or sit with me while I game. My wife and I also play more co-op games now, and gaming on a 65'' screen is a nice change...

I consider myself a pretty decently ""skilled"" gamer. Played many competitive games throughout the years and I have usually no issues whatsoever beating most games on ""hard"" or ""very hard"" difficulties.

I'd say the games I excel the most at are ""Souls""-like games, Adventure/RPGs, platformers and, I USED to be good at first person shooters... that is, until I played one with a controller.

I am ***NOT*** here to start a PC/console argument. That's stupid. It's just that there are a lot of interesting FPS games on Xbox and no matter how much I try, I just can't seem to do it... I have trouble aiming. YES, I could probably easily just buy it on Steam and play on my PC instead, but I want to challenge myself. I want to become good with a controller. The upcoming game [Starfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfield_(video_game)) is also a reason I'm motivated to become prolific with a controller.

I wanted to know: Do most console FPS competitive players play with an ""Elite"": style controller with paddles and customizable thumbstick resistances and inputs? Is it ***necessary*** to invest in one of these to step up your game? Or are there high-level players who manage with a standard controller?

Any tips for options in the game? My main issue is really ***aiming***... After 30+ years of aiming with a mouse, I have a really hard time aiming with thumbsticks. Auto-aim options help a little but no much. I feel like there's something I must be doing wrong. Everything feels clunky and if I want to aim a particular part of the enemy's body, it seems impossible.

I'm honestly feeling a bit tempted to get the Steam Deck at its reduced price, going for about 360 excl. sales tax (which would probably bring it to around 380. The thing is, I don't know if this means it may get even cheaper in the future with other holiday sales, or if this is just a special occasion since it's the anniversary of its release, and may never happen again.

I will say that I do have about 500 games in my Steam library, over half of which are indies that would be Deck compatible, but I also have a couple Surface computers, which supposedly should be able to run them fine. Of course, when I do try to run even the simplest games, they cause my computers to overheat and occasionally freeze up.   I do also have a Switch and Playstation 4, which were gifts for finishing school, and I'd feel guilty leaving them behind since they were from my family. Also there are some nice looking exclusives for Nintendo on the horizon, but I'm not entirely sure how future proofed my libraries on either system would be for generations to come.

112,Game idea. What are your thoughts?,11tr077,"Some of my ideas about an MMORPG. Personally I think that this game should focus on players of other types of games and not just to hardcore MMORPG players. Anyways, here we go. (5-6 mins reading)

**Playstyle**

The game has an action combat style where key sequences lead to even better combos like mortal combat, nothing too difficult (since ppl can just use macros to do them) just as much to make combat feel smooth. Skills will be like a branch, for example E > E > 1 is different than E > E > 3 etc. Leveling gives you points that you use to go further to the branch of each skill. Balancing those skills is important so that ppl dont use the same skills repeatedly. In the end of a branch you will get something like a buff so pretty much you have to use all branches. Some parts of gear will buff some skills so you might want to use them more etc. I kindly hate metas and i think balancing skills can let ppl have their own playstyles instead of using the best one.


**Classes**

There will be a lot of classes (some of them will be locked by race). The combination of class and race will make a “hero”. Some heroes can be used by all races and some others due to lore will be locked to a single race. Pretty much if you are tired of the hero that you main, you can buy a new one (most likely it will be something like a weapon or a scroll) and a new tab will be available at your skill menu ( J key most likely 😂) where you can use the points to go further in the skill branches of the new hero (some skills will be locked because you have to master the hero to unlock them, most likely it will require you to do 1million damage with the previous skill or finish 100 npcs with that skill etc). Every new hero that will be released it will be available only by paying $$ until a newer hero get released 3-4 months later where the previous one will be available with ingame currency and goes on. I hate alt accounts or alt characters on mmo games because you either feel like you mastered your main one and want to try something new or you are forced to make one because of grind etc to feed main one and i think that in this way you dont have to make an alt except if you want to play that specific hero that is race locked. Last but not least, the holy trinity (tank, healer ,dps). I know that most ppl prefer dps classes but for those few ones who would like to play tank with every class possible and since heroes will be balanced in a way that everyone have a block, most classes will be able to tank but most likely not with the same difficulty. Healers will be linked with the tank and after dealing damage to boss a bar will get increased and healer will use that to heal. Some skills will use 20% of the bar while other skills will use the full bar etc. In the end of a skill branch all skills from 1-5 will become the same spell and if the player press 1 they will heal the 1st member of group, if they press 2 they will heal the 2nd member etc. For party heal and debuff removal there will be an aoe circle that player can see if everyone is inside and can be healed/blessed.


**PvE**

I hate when you have to reach endgame to engage with newer content or when a friend joins and they have to play 200 hours before you can play together. that being said there will be no endgame except raids

**Dungeons (5man, 20-30min long)**, there will be actual entrances to dungeons on world map but you will need something like an offering item that you have to use to enter, that been said, you wont be able to spam a single dungeon 100 times to progress on gear. Instead all dungeons will give what you need to progress depending on your level. In this way you play with older content too. So you may ask what if you run out of offering items? In this case, the dungeon finder window will open up and tell you to search for a random dungeon. What if you outlevel older dungeons? You actually wont, there will be a soft cap curve that even if you level higher the curve gets almost flat and you dont do any more damage. For example, you are lvl 100 and your friends are lvl 10, 34, 37, 43 and 46 respectively and you enter a 40lvl dungeon. Your lvls now will be (45, 35, 35, 37, 43 and 45 respectively) so pretty much a lower cap and higher cap of 5. In this way your lvl43 friend might do higher damage if you dont try your best. Lastly, i was also thinking about pve elo where dungeon gets more difficult depending on the group’s elo , so you still have fun doing dungeons you may did many times before.

**Raids (25man, 1.5h-2h long if done perfectly)**, as i said earlier raids will be endgame, that been said they will be locked behind story and some personal achievement that shows you are able to do raid’s mechanics such as clearing 10 times some difficult solo dungeon that have similar mechanics to the raid you want to enter (most ppl are afraid to take random to their raids because they feel like dealing with apes and might wipe them for hours long so they stick to their guilds)

world monster and bosses, nothing much to be said here, you get your reward based on your % you dealt


**PvP**

As i said earlier the combat system will be an improved version of combat system which is based on players skills only and gear wont matter. you can spam the block button like fighter style games but there is a window between them where enemy can engage, you can jump to avoid lower hits etc.. making pvp fast paced and increadible to watch. Anyways, after the first two chapter of story (tutorial) everyone can enter pvp matches and based on their elo they get similar elo enemies.

**Open world**, after each maintenance, game will ask each governor of a race to chose with which races he want peace and which war. In specific time of a day ppl can attack other races outside cities based on those decisions. (not so sure of open world pvp tbf, not my type.. might remove that)

**1v1** nothing to be said here, just an arena with balanced gears where only players’ skills matter

**5v5** (not sure if this should be in an arena as well or some other map like mobas or shooting games)

**50v50** (or more, depends if servers can handle) will be a siege type game where one team attacks and one defends.

**Monetization**

The game will be f2p, but people can buy monthly pass that gives them a sign near their name (like twitter blue 😂) and some other stuff but nothing special that would even make someone think its p2w. New heroes will be buyable till a newer one gets released (like i said in classes section). Skins and emotes on marketplace. And lastly dlcs. Those will be like prequels of movies, side stories that go deeper into lore and give you some skins etc. Nothing that you actually need to improve your gear.


**Story**

The game starts with a clip showing the lore of the game, not very long to be specific.. just some key events that happened in the past till the day you are born. In the first chapter you play as your actuall hero you created on character creation, in this chapter you learn about your class and going threw events that lead you to the 3rd chapter. In the second chapter, you play as kid version of your character till you reach the point you have grown to your actual created character, here you learn about the race you chose and what made you leave that place (in a race for example the village was destroyed, in some race you were recruited and in some other races you just stayed there) after 2nd chapter ends, a video plays and in the end it shows you were you started in 1st chapter. Those two chapters are something like a tutorial and they can be skipped at any time. In any case, in the 3rd chapter everyone is in the same city  and the story is the same for all races. There will be side stories where you learn more about a race and some events happened in the past (in the form of an expansion most likely). Mostly, you are not the main hero of the story (some chapter of story will focus on you as a being). Of course your actions have an impact to how story develops, but you are not “the chosen one” that will solve everything and bring balance to the force. There are beings that you cant beat alone even in endgame and some others who are blessed by gods etc whom power is even bigger etc (more about the story in the part where i explain the world). Anyways, the story is very important and it should be full of emotions. Some of your friends die, things dont go as planned, epic fights etc. Everything that makes a story stand out from the rest. No stupid quest like find some kid’s toy or collect 10x of those things that make no sense.


**World**

This game has ""everything"". A huge map that contains every region you can imagine, some races for example are: ancient Chinese, Egypt and Greece like, people who live in a snow place ( Vikings style), medieval, pirates , steampunk (a city like columbia from bioshock infinite, in this race gunner classes will be race locked), dwarfs (most likely a city in a mountain), elves and high elves (city on a huge tree), amazons (female muscle warriors like from futurama, 2-3 times bigger than other races), some little and cute race (like kirbies or yordles from lol), centaurs, half human half tiger/wolf race where you transform fully on human or animal, angles and demons (having wings and can fly slightly of ground instead of walking) and undead (skeletons, ghosts, spirits etc). As i said earlier about higher beings, there is a goddess of creation which had some children and they had theirs etc.. key points are also ascended city (like paradise), spirit realm/underworld/void and lastly the in-between (a place where you are judged by a higher being with an ancient scale. Some people are stuck there for centuries as a punishment from some god). There are also small maps for the steampunk city, in-between, ascended city and underworld. Lastly there is a single server for every region but it is divided into channels based on your ip address so that you can get the lowest ping or play with player with similar pink so you dont feel that you suck compared to others. Each channel has its own code e.g. #03939280. Of course you can change channels to join your friends but i guess that would need a loading screen.

121,The next generation of video games will have NPC's that can talk to you about anything for as long as you want. Then they'll become fully-interactive movies with any plot that you want.,11tovqg,"I've been messing around with ChatGPT for the past few weeks, and the thing is blowing my mind. I realized, obviously, that this technology can be slotted right into an RPG and allow you to talk to NPC's totally naturally about any topic (though I'm sure they'd be programmed to feign ignorance of things outside the game world). 

The first generation (which we may skip since the tech is developing so fast) may just have each NPC have a personality like ""bitter drunken fruit vendor,"" but the interaction will be on a totally new level. Imagine being able to go to a bar in Skyrim and just randomly talk to a guard about how he was trained and where he grew up. The game may forget the conversation right after, and it may have no effect on the game world, but just that blows my mind. It's obviously easy, I had ChatGPT simulate it for me already.

Then of course, the next generation will allow the conversations to effect the plot. The game will likely have enough memory to let what you say or hear change objectives sometimes in the story, and will know what each character said to you and what you said back.

After that, the games will obviously be able to generate any plot you want and let the plot fit your actions. ChatGPT can already make-up stories on the fly, the graphics engine needs only to be able to visualize what it says. It may take a few years, or maybe not at this rate.

I can definitely envision a future where there are posts on boards like ""How to turn Elders Scroll VII into a Skooma-dealing game, included map seed, which locations to visit and what to say to each NPC."" 

With deepfake technology, you'll even be able to include any actors who may agreed to appear in the game, in whatever roles you ask. Provided it's safe-for-work.

I think I still own this issue, but

1. I have no idea where it is.
2. I wouldn't know which issue it is.

However,  I've been wanting to find this image.  I called it a ""Poster/Ad""  because I am not sure which it was, but I'm leaning towards it being an  ad for renewing the subscription.  Either way, as I recall it was a  two-page spread with the caption, ""The Hits Just Keep On Coming!""  The  illustration was a band playing on stage, with Yoshi as the drummer and  Banjo and Conker on guitars/bass.  Link may or may not have been in the band, as I remember a picture of him with a guitar, but I'm not sure it was this one.  In the audience, Mario and Donkey  Kong were cheering.

Again I don't  remember the issue but some things can help narrow it down.  First, this  was made before Conker's WIP game got overhauled into *Bad Fur Day*,  causing NP to stop talking about it.  Second, while Banjo and Conker  might have been original art, I think the render of Yoshi was from *Yoshi's Story*.   *Banjo-Kazooie* was probably released by then, *Banjo-Tooie* was probably not.

I have a few myself;

• Quicker load times
• Autosave
• Preloading
• Cloud saves

But I think the one I take for granted the most is the ability to pause a game during a cutscene. My attention span has never been great - I never stick to one thing for too long before doing something else to break up any tedium I might experience. Cutscenes are hit and miss. Some get to the point, others drag on for long periods of time.

Being able to pause during cutscenes is a godsend. If I could combine it with another thing I love about modern games, it'd be that and being able to put my console to sleep, so that not only do I get to wake up my console another time, but I won't have to reload and rewatch a long cutscenes from the start. If it was two generations prior, I wouldn't be able to do that. It's especially handy when I have to go somewhere.

Perfect example. I had to go to the toilet, so I was able to pause the cutscene and go to the bathroom, and also write this post.

Around about 2013, I was a massive Tomb Raider fan who decided to trade my PS4 in for an Xbox One at the time so that i wouldn't have to wait to play Rise Of The Tomb Raider. As time went by, Microsoft implemented backwards compatibility and then Gamepass.

By then, i was pretty much sticking with Xbox for the foreseeable future. I managed to grab a Series X on release and was blown away by how seamless everything was integrated & accessible on the now current gen console. It was quite amazing playing so many older titles with FPS boosts, increased resolution, etc. 

Playstation had slightly caught my attention with the wealth of incredible exclusives that they had been releasing constantly. In the last two years or so, there hadn't been many great Xbox Exclusives besides Gears 5  & Hi-Fi Rush IMO. It slowly dawned on me that my Series X had just been primarily playing games from last gen and even earlier. I took the leap last week and swapped my series x for a PS5.

Having not played a sony console in almost a decade, i was absolutely blown away by the wealth of content available on PS+/Sony Gamepass what ever you want to call it & then they even dropped the brand new horzion game on it last week.  Checked out Spiderman (PS5 Version) and was blown away by the visuals. Even though the series x is more powerful, i don't think I've seen a game look that incredible in a long time.

Recently, i just checked out the Resident Evil 4 Demo and OMFG, the adaptive triggers, the inbuilt mic speaker for Leon's communication, and the haptic vibration feedback. 
The bloody controller has blown me away. I had no idea how next gen it would actually feel compared to the xbox controller.

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft)

&#x200B;

>On 15 September 2014, Microsoft announced a $2.5 billion deal to buy Mojang, along with the ownership of the Minecraft intellectual property.\[120\]\[121\]\[122\] The deal was suggested by Persson when he posted a tweet asking a corporation to buy his share of the game after receiving criticism for enforcing terms in the game's end-user license agreement (EULA), which had been present in the EULA in the prior three years.\[123\]\[124\]\[125\] According to Persson, Mojang CEO Carl Manneh received a call from a Microsoft executive shortly after the tweet, asking if Persson was serious about a deal. Mojang was also approached by other companies including Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts.\[125\] **The deal with Microsoft was arbitrated on 6 November 2014 and led to Persson becoming one of Forbes' ""World's Billionaires""**

&#x200B;

Even if you wanted to be really really fucking stupid about the whole thing the game was released on the system the same month as MS announced a desire to buy the IP.  Which means Mojang would have already had months to negotiate with Sony for the port and to put in the effort to build the port before MS even registered the desire to buy it.  Due to the fact they would need to work with Sony to get PS4 development kits and the assorted legal work needed to release a game on a console.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yet I keep seeing people claim that MS allowed the game on PS3/PS4. And even getting angry when you point out that they did not.  The only system that MS can be given credit for releasing the game on is Nintendo as the Switch and New 3DS versions of the game came out in 2017. Which was of course 3 years give or take a couple of months after they acquired the IP rights.

* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 & 2
* Tenchu: Stealth Assassin
* Metal Gear Solid 1-4
* Condemned: Criminal Origins & Bloodshot (esp in VR!)
* Splinter Cell
* Syphon Filter
* Silent Hill 1 & 2
* Jade Empire (one of old school Bioware's best games)
* Fear Effect (unique, adult PS1 game that was 4 discs lol)
* Dino Crisis

I can think of a few others I'd love to be remade but those are probably my top 10. Some others I'd love to see brought back or remade would be the Driver series, Black (one of the best shooters on Xbox/PS2 and way ahead of its time), NFS Underground 2, the Killzone series, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Def Jam: Fight for New York (probably the most fun I ever had playing a fighting game & the music was great), Fable series, Parasite Eve, Beyond Good & Evil (weren't we supposed to get a sequel ages ago?), Shenmue, Fight Night series, Star Wars: Jedi Outcast and The Force Unleashed, Half Life series, Prince of Persia, GTA: San Andreas/Vice City and Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. So those are all the games that I believe are deserving of being brought back into the current generation or deserve remakes of the original games, if not entirely new games. 

I can't even imagine how sick the Condemned games would be in VR, they're literally *perfect* for it; first person melee combat, horror, creepy af atmosphere and cool detective/investigation mechanics. And I can't imagine how amazing Dino Crisis or Fear Effect could be with today's graphics and tech. So I'm curious what everyone else thinks are games deserving of being remade, and could actually be successful. Like I'd love a remake of Indigo Prophecy or Wild 9 but I know they likely wouldn't be commercially successful so I didn't even put em on the list. I'm hoping this post blows up and some game devs see it and recognize how much money could be made with remakes of some of these titles.

And i don't mean just jumpscares or ambushes (Like for example in The Last Of Us, you open lots of doors and sometimes opening a door triggers a staged scene or something like that, but i dont consider that as a ""safe place""), i mean things like crafting benches or save stations (also safe zones, but i cant think of any example of this), two examples are TLOU 2 and Dead Space 1, on TLOU 2, i was recently shown by a friend that if you start crafting at a certain crafting bench, you [get ambushed](https://youtu.be/i4ez9uGGRq4?t=70), and in Dead Space 1 (2008), a very similar thing happens, only that an enemy [falls behind you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOo1OtaLwA&ab_channel=Walkthrough%21Database) and its more of a jumpscare (with the music and all), so yeah, anyone know the name of this ""concept""? i just love it when they do stuff like this in games, it keeps the gameplay fresh and makes you keep an eye out the whole time, does anyone else agree with me or do you guys not really care for this kind of stuff?

PS: While looking for the Dead Space clip, i came across a [Dead Space Remake clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFhbqvxFNdA&ab_channel=Trathiel) which does something similar to both the clips i showed here but without any enemy interaction, just pure suspense, even the first comment says something along the lines of what im saying, ""... you feel so vulnerable in such a small area that you're so used to as a safe haven""",PastelLicuado,10,0,0.45

193,Game Suggestions Please,11s4bge,"Hi All,

My buddies and I got into Fortnite after work during the pandemic and we have fallen off big time regarding consistently hopping on and playing together. We have been discussing that we are all ready for a new game and want something more relaxing. Over our discussion, we have concluded that we are looking for a 4-player campaign or pve type of game that we can enjoy casually and outside of the popular BR format. We tried sea of thieves this week and unfortunately I got super seasick lmfao. 

General Specifications:

\- Ideally cross platform, we have 2 on xbox, 1 on pc, and 1 on ps5

\- PvE or Campaign style game no BR

We have tossed around titles like Destiny 2 but my hesitation is that I've heard destiny 2 is an insane grind and can feel very repetitive. Minecraft also comes to mind but that would take some convincing as the guys are all 27+ and have never tried minecraft. Honestly if a game like Dragon Age Inquisition had a 4 player cross platform campaign that would be exactly what I think we would enjoy. Heck, we would be on 2K23 or FIFA right now running a group franchise or campaign right now if they had cross-platform.

Let me know if there are any games out there that would work. Any thoughts are appreciated",plow_poon,3,0,0.25
194,Games with cool and fun utility spells,11s3j2h,"To be clear, I mean OUT of combat utility.

One of my favorite things in gaming is when you unlock a spell or ability that expedites regular mundane activities or otherwise turns them into something fun that you look forward to. Stuff like all those ""filler"" spells in DnD that create feasts and clean the kitchen after, or create a temporary house or what have you. There's a lot of cool potential in these types of spells but I VERY rarely see games dabble in this type of thing, usually reserving magic as almost entirely combat/healing based.

Some examples

1. Forespoken - Say what you will about the game, but the Burrow spell was something I didn't know I needed in my games until I got it. They took it a step further and had it reduce other cooldowns as well making it useful in combat as well as outside of it. (for those who don't know, the spell creates vines that burrow away from the PC and will automatically collect all loot within a certain radius, and it reduces the cooldown of your other support spells proportionate to the amount of loot gathered).
2. Sun Haven - Has a ton of spells that expedite the farming/mining in the game, such as a spell that mines all rocks in an area around you, creates earthquakes to till the soil and rain clouds to water crops, all VERY cool, thematic and just feel good to use.
3. Skyrim WITH mods - Not gonna list them all, but base skyrim had the spell that guides you to your objective, which was basically useless given the compass, but MODDED skyrim added a tone of cool utility spells, check out Apocalypse and Ordinator's magic supplements for some cool stuff like that.

That's about all I can think of off the top of my head, so if anyone has any other suggestions for games with a decent amount of this type of thing please let me know!",shiek200,7,0,0.46

It is an innate reaction to blood and gore that is hard to control. Other changeable reasons are some younger teenagers and those who just want more tame media.

I'm not saying that there should be no blood and gore in videogames. And there's some games where that's not feasible to change. With this new wave of accessibility settings in games, I just wish there were more games with settings to turn off blood and gore. Elden Ring and Ghost of Tsushima are two excellent examples of games with a setting to turn blood off.

But i think even if in a surface level consumer perspective, maybe a person who did consume the first game that did the live service first, if that's the case why would i play anything else, espiecially if the business model and money come from me needing to dedicate my life to that game, why would i actually play your game when this game is basically filling my need.

232,Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – a love letter to the infinity engine,11raiic,"As I wrap up a 300-hour journey through these two games -- one that started in November last year, but in reality started years earlier -- I find myself drawn to comparisons to Baldur’s Gate (BG1) and Baldur’s Gate II (BG2). You have two games using a well-loved system (Pathfinder 1st edition) in a real-time with pause (RTWP) engine with a not quite isometric camera. In the first you have that feeling of fresh-faced adventure and wandering a world to encounter new challenges just like BG, while the sequel has a far more focused approach which pushes you ever forward, along with a chapter where the world opens up and a ton of side-quests appear in your log, just like BG2.

These games were subject to successful Kickstarter funding campaigns, though given their production positioning them as AA games, there was clearly publisher money involved at some point. I also wonder if those campaigns aren’t the reason for some of the problems I’ll get into.

I bounced off Kingmaker (KM) a number of times, spending almost 70 hours across multiple playthroughs which never made it past act 1. Yet I kept coming back as the game offers a compelling world to explore. I'd also heard great things about Wrath of the Righteous (WoTR), particularly its mythic path system, so wanted to play that.

I’ve been playing CRPGs for decades, all the way back to Bard’s Tale. Yet it was Bioware’s Baldur’s Gate that gave me an obsession for the genre, teaching me that the kind of games I loved were shared adventures with interesting characters. I got obsessed enough with that series that I worked on the [Ascension]( https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/quests/ascension/) mod for Throne of Bhaal because I wasn’t ready to let go. Since then, CRPGs have dominated my gaming, through companies like Bioware, Obsidian, CD Projekt RED, Harebrained Schemes, and Bethesda.

Both KM and WoTR are so clearly inspired by BG series everything that came out of the Infinity Engine. While the Pillars of Eternity games were presented as nostalgia tributes to the Infinity Engine games, these feel much closer to those games, both for good and bad, and a large part of that is the Pathfinder system.

# Pathfinder

I won’t pretend to be an expert in this, but Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) had a controversial 4th edition, with concern from fans that it was a gross simplification driven by trends in the online RPG space. This led to the Pathfinder system, a fork of AD&D 3.5, which has itself had its own controversy with its 2nd edition.

Both KM and WoTR are based on the 1st edition and are great examples as to why the system is nicknamed Mathfinder.

These games reflect my first experience with the system.

# My setup

I played KM as a neutral good Ranger at Challenging difficulty, and WoTR as a neutral (dipping in and out of evil) Slayer at Core difficulty. In KM I felt Challenging should be well suited to someone with Infinity Engine experience, and also someone who had played Act 1 multiple times now. I chose Core in WoTR as that was the minimal level for numerous achievements and therefore a level where I hoped the game would punish me for lazy play, but not require the kind of hardcore optimisation of higher difficulties.

If I had to pick an example of perfect difficulty, it would be Dragon Age Inquisition at Insane difficulty. Encounters would sometimes take a couple of tries, but almost never more than two, and after every loss I could always identify the mistake **I** had made, and correct it. Anything outside the difficulty curve was optional and clearly marked, and no big spikes hit me at any time. That game had its problems, but it has the best difficulty curve I've found in a CRPG.

# Overview

Kingmaker has a strong opening act, and it’s one of the reasons I kept coming back. It introduces all the systems, and not just the combat ones, but also how skills will be used for dialogue checks, and how decisions can have consequences. Part of what was so exciting about act 1 were the various party combinations you could emerge from the tutorial with, or how the order you visit things on the world map can change how encounters play out. I went to a tomb expecting a particular encounter, only to find because I’d done things in a different order the tomb was empty and looted. It keeps things fresh, and both games keep this feeling of consequence throughout, with decisions you made coming back to influence characters and events. The conclusion of one companion quest near the end of KM had their decision partly influenced by a decision I made in the tutorial. Amazing stuff.

Both games also have cool text adventure portions. If you're familiar with such from Pillars of Eternity it's just like that, but running for longer, and occurring far more regularly. Honestly, they make much better use of it than Pillars did. I was more of a fan of the presentation in KM, especially the line art style, but text adventures were always a welcome break in both.

These are games of high highs and low lows, really the extremes are kind of incredible. At their peak you’re partaking in some epic dialogues, seeing how decisions you made earlier have shaped this scene, or perhaps even caused it to happen whereas it won’t for other players. You know that the choices you make are having a huge impact on your game to come. At their lowest moments you’re stuck manging a not so mini mini-game or bashing your head against yet another difficulty spike.

WoTR might be one of the best choice & consequence games of all time. You have multiple “mythic paths”, and each has huge chunks of content that are unique to them. While this is a systems driven game, I actually made what felt like a suboptimal choice in taking the Demon mythic path, but felt like the right narrative choice for my adventure. That choice went on to shape every relationship I had, and completely changed the tone of my game. And that’s just one of six options available to you! It’s an unbelievable level of effort, in part made possible by the minimal voice acting and much heavier reliance on text.

However, the games have a few really big problems.

# Combat

This is where the slavish adherence to Pathfinder becomes a problem. It’s a system designed for tabletop sessions, where someone can just as viably create themselves a master of non-combat elements as combat. But these games are packed full of combat encounters, and non-combat skills are just something you max out across the party without a thought. So long as someone in the party knows religion you’re good, doesn’t matter who.

The issue with combat is that you make next to no interesting decisions. 49% of combat is build, which will often involve decisions made tens of hours ago, another 49% is pre-buffing, and then only 2% is decisions in combat. The way things play out is you carefully build characters to max key stats, build synergies, and get equipment that compliments all this. That’s really cool. But then you reach a map, you run through your pre-buff routine (and later on you’ll have 40-50 effects on each character), and then you lawn mower the map. Offensive spells are next to worthless because there are too many encounters, so you derive infinitely more value from buffs. Cleanse the map, then go back and loot everything when it doesn’t matter if the buffs run out.

Buffing was so critical in WoTR that I ended up installing [a mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/195) to do it at the press of a button as I was beginning to dread enemies just for the five minute buff routine it would entail. Pre-buffing is not something I’ve missed in my CRPGs.

# Encounter design

In KM act 1 you encounter a campsite where everyone is dead, but you can rest. In this region there are warring mites and kobolds. However, they weren’t a danger to me as I had convinced both I was their ally, hence I’m safe to rest. Hah! Nope, some death skull spawns and murders you. How were you supposed to know that would happen? That’s the neat part, you don’t! And the games are packed with stuff like this where you’re steamrolling some area, then a murder monster appears and slaps you down.

Another classic is 99% of the time when you spot a monster, the game then auto-pauses so you can do what you need to do, except for the 1% of the time where it instead cutscenes you into range before you can do anything. Thanks, game!

Among KM players, just hearing about the House at the Edge of Time is enough to trigger traumatic flashbacks. I have to agree with them, that is peak Owlcat bullshit.

There are two aspects which make all this more frustrating than it needs to be.

## The combat log is shit

At the start you’ll think the combat log is good. It shows die rolls, breaks them down, you can see where most stuff comes from. Nice. Then you start to level up, and it doesn’t scale at all. By the end of WoTR you’ll be generating hundreds of lines every round, and a round is six seconds long. Good luck finding out why your archer missed in the middle of all that.

The log is in desperate need of a filter, and without one it’s an unusable nightmare. In the final battle of WoTR I couldn’t find how to counter what the boss had done, because they cast multiple area-of-effect spells in a battle with 15 combatants, generating hundreds of entries, and that’s not including the hundreds I was generating simultaneously. In that final battle I also stumbled into the discovery that I had completely underestimated the power of a certain ability because delving into the log was such a nightmare I’d never noticed before.

It’s also not very accurate. At times you will see damage being assigned to someone who already died. Sometimes checks are just missing and it’s not clear why. Other times you will see some number that has no item or feat source, leading to you tearing your hair out trying to figure out why a companion is doing more damage than you thought they would. If all you know is their name you’ll have to trawl through 40 feats, 40 buffs, and 20 items to figure out which one is doing the thing.

The mechanics are also overwhelming. I’m not sure even the designers understand how it all fits together. Even at the end of my 300 hours I was discovering ways the system works I hadn’t known. Something I didn’t notice until late for example was that each ability applied on an attack isn’t handled as part of the weapon’s attack damage, and that this then leads to certain effects being exponentially useful because while you’re ostensibly applying them to the weapon, they get applied to each effect. Then perhaps you have something which causes certain attacks to happen multiple times. So now that 2d6 bonus you applied is suddenly 10d6. Nothing in the game will tell you this, you have to stumble across it in the logs, and this is just one example!

The log simply isn’t fit for purpose.

UI in general is a problem with the games. Playing without a mod which allows you to buff at the press of a button is like indulging in self-flagellation.

## Combat is too easy to prepare you for when it isn't

If you build well and always apply your buffs you should be able to get through most combats without having to step in. Maybe you adjust targeting order, or split the archers to take out the backline while your frontline holds up the enemy. But what this means is when the game throws some nightmare encounter at you you're slamming into a wall without the education to know how to scale it. This is on the critical path.

Just as bad was when an enemy appeared that required a completely different toolset to beat than anything else present, especially frustrating when it's bosses with immunities to everything you used to get through the dungeon up until this point. Even when you are in a position to change the party, or overhaul your spell set, it felt like a tedious slog rather than a meaningful challenge. The game never gives you any indication of what threat you’ll face at any location, so you always bring the 99% effective party and spell composition. KM isn’t as bad, as most of these types of encounters exist in their own area and so you leave and come back later, but WoTR loved to do this mid-dungeon. One dungeon locks you in, and if you brought the wrong party for its challenge, you better hope you’ve got an earlier save.

This was one of my biggest sources of frustration throughout both games.

There’s also the mess of turn-based versus RTWP. In KM a well-regarded mod was put out with a turn-based setup. It’s actually a much better way to get a handle on how combat is working than RTWP allows for, but is also completely unsuitable for a game of this scale. WoTR has turn-based built-in, and this leads to the Arcanum problem of how do you balance for both? You can’t. The best example of this are swarms, where in RTWP a bunch of tics or locusts are the deadlier than any demon lord, but in turn-based are absolutely no threat whatsoever. Owlcat need to pick their poison and balance around it, you shouldn’t be seeing posts recommend switching to turn-based to beat certain encounters. I am relieved to see that their next game, Rogue Trader, will be turn-based only.

# Slavish adherence to systems which don’t belong in a computer game

The encounter design necessitates quick save since you never know when you’re going to stumble into some murder encounter. However, quick save undermines other systems. If you failed to pick a lock you need to come back when you've increased your skills. Disarming a trap comes with the danger of triggering it. Except neither of these things are true because the game has quick save.

The real issue is that there is no reward for failure. Triggering a trap doesn’t lead to some new, interesting outcome, you just take a bunch of damage that will make things harder, and harder in this game usually just means longer. There’s no incentive to let such failures stand and you will save before every trap, every chest, and reload if you fail. There needs to be a better way, either through designing for failure, or switching to a Boolean system.

My favourite example is in WoTR if you fail certain skill checks then time passes. Time passes causes all your buffs to run out. Without those buffs you’re under-powered for the area. This necessitates a rest and then re-buff. Or are you simply going to reload your save from before the skill failure? There’s no reason to accept the failure. In tabletop this means the party has to adapt and the dungeon master adjusts the scenario accordingly, but in a computer game it’s just a waste of your time.

And it's odd, because the game does have some interesting failures. For example, at one point you might choose to renounce a mythic path for another, yet some third-party tries to stop you, leading to a skill check. Pass, and you change path, fail and you stick to your original. Neither route is wrong, so failure is perfectly acceptable and leads to an outcome that is both narratively and mechanically interesting. I want more of that, please.

# Dreadful not so mini games

Both games feature ill-advised strategic games that sit above the CRPG layer. Both serve as undesired interruptions to the cool CRPG you’re playing. KM’s is heavily reliant on die rolls you have little control over and almost necessitates quick load to avoid getting randomly screwed with failure leading to a spiral of doom as failure begets failure. WoTR’s is just a tedious chore and is what if Heroes of Might & Magic 3 (HOMM3) but shit, and I didn’t much like HOMM3 in the first place. Honestly, WoTR feels like it has the overland travel simply because KM did, despite the fact that there's very little to discover out there.

Both have the same issue where nothing on the strategic level really impacts the CRPG aspect, so it’s hard to care about any of it. The only times either work is when you get the more traditional throne room scene where you make key decisions via dialogue. These allow for cool character expression, both by yourself and your companions. It feels more like running a kingdom/crusade than anything that happens on the strategic map.

Had they been limited to assigning advisors and throne room scenes then they’d have been good, and indeed the way different advisors in KM can play out is cool, but generally these modes are just a massive time sink that represent a good 15% of your play time. You can’t ignore them either because you can lose the game in this mode, and at least in KM certain powerful items are tied to quest lines which are tied to this.

# A problem with endings

Sadly, both games share a problem, and that’s the ending. In recent years CRPGs have begun to understand the importance of the denouement, and CD Projekt RED is a prime example of this with both Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 having deeply satisfying send offs. Meanwhile, WoTR has one of the least satisfying and most jarring endings I’ve ever encountered, where the final boss fight concludes then you’re immediately dumped into some very short slides and the game ends.

Owlcat need to trim some of the fat from their games and scale back their plans. Both KM and WoTR are clearly running out of steam towards the end. In KM the maps you unlock near the end have far less locations to explore, while in WoTR the reactivity starts to fall apart with key events not being commented on by individuals who absolutely would have something to say. You can even sacrifice your life and your love interest won’t have a word to say about it.

For all the replayability of WoTR, I went from “can’t wait to experience this journey again” to “meh” because the destination is just that unsatisfying. Slides are a poor way of presenting an ending at the best of times, and this is one of the worst uses of them I’ve seen to date. It’s not only that it’s jarring, it’s that the slides are so slight. While it’s not Mass Effect 3 bad, it did leave me with a sort of empty feeling, and not in the good way an epic EPG can. WoTR is actually a step back from KM in this regard, which had more detail and reactivity in its slides, though both really need an epilogue piece.

Both games have secret endings, and while I don't know much about the WoTR one, I went into KM prepared. I did every quest, I completed every kingdom research item. The one time I could just feel I'd picked a bad dialogue option with the antagonist that was taking me off the path, I reloaded. Then, right at the end, I found I couldn't get the secret ending because 50 hours earlier a secret die roll had happened without me knowing and I'd failed a check. This is the Owlcat design philosophy in a nutshell, and makes me wonder why they combine this with such long games.

# Despite it all I love these games

It’s the unabashed ambition most of all. KM gives you that feeling of BG1 where you’re exploring the land, stumbling upon cool encounters. WoTR has some of the best choice & consequence stuff I’ve ever seen in a CRPG, and begs for you to replay it.

I love the mechanical stuff. It’s intimidating as hell, and I almost always stuck to single class, but figuring out how to try and optimise your build, put together cool synergies, and then see it tear through enemies, never gets old. Even as I came to the end of each game I was thinking how I’d do things differently next time.

My primary love for CRPGs though isn’t systems based, it’s narrative. I want a world packed with people I care about. It’s why I was along for the ride when Bioware started to trim the fat in the Mass Effect games, and why CD Projekt RED is my current favourite RPG company.

KM, despite being touted as a narrative CRPG is actually lighter than you might expect. The comparison to BG1 & BG2 earlier wasn’t an accident. It’s not BG1 light, but you can see in WoTR that Owlcat have gained more confidence and experience in putting this stuff together. The companions are more interesting, do more to defy expectations in their arcs, and the romance choices are far more interesting. I could do without my 160 hour CRPG allowing me to tank a romance through one bad dialogue choice, but Bioware didn’t master this overnight either. And the romances are a breath of fresh air if you found Bioware stuff fairly milquetoast.

I can't give Owlcat enough credit for their writing of evil characters. They're not treated as one-note, or cackling idiots, rather they have their own world views which are treated as seriously as anything else. A favourite of mine in WoTR is Regill, your Hellknight companion who embodies the philosophy of victory through discipline, and as he tells one character, ""The forces of good are not weak, it's just you."" He's labelled as lawful evil because of his philosophy, but he sees himself one of the good guys. And the game is packed with characters like this. And this equally applies to being evil yourself, where you can pursue paths of lust, or power, or ambition, or ""the greater good"", rather than just being a dick. I haven't had this much fun playing evil since Dragon Age Origins, and the warden who had yet to meet the demon he wouldn't do a deal with.

What I also loved is how much variability I had in party composition, especially in KM. Generally in a CRPG I lock in my party and it never changes, but here I had real options, and the game provided me with the equipment necessary to keep everyone viable. In KM I left one companion at a ford for a long time because I couldn’t be bothered to change up my party, yet by the end of the game they’d become a key part of my personal story and I felt a close, personal connection to them.

WoTR hits some incredible highs. When you’re standing before demon lords and gods and making choices that you know will shape the entire story to come, well that’s just CRPG heroin to me. The game hits these sorts of highs over and over and over again. So many epic moments, and I only wish it didn’t end in such a wet fart.

I know I dwelled far more on bad than the good, but ultimately if you enjoyed Infinity Engine games then you’re getting into something that is a natural evolution, while also keeping many of the flaws those games had too.

There has been much discussion over the years about wasted content, time spent making things a player will never see, and companies trying to avoid this. I'm glad Owlcat don't, because content I will never see is what allows me to have experienced *my* story rather than *the* story, and it makes the game mean so much more to me. The mistakes Owlcat make are also a reason for their strengths, because they haven't soaked in the prevailing wisdom of what you should and should not do, so why not make six completely different paths of the player? I'm glad of it, that someone out there is making this kind of game still.

I find myself with the realisation that Owlcat is the company Beamdog so desperately wanted to be.

# So which should you play?

WoTR is the better game, no two ways about it. The companions are better developed, and the writers are good at defying expectations in how an arc should play out. The mythic path system really lets you shape your own story, and critically it’s a much tighter story than KM’s episodic feel.

Yet I’d say KM is the better first game. WoTR has a more fleshed out tutorial, but it really doesn’t convey the stuff you need to know, and in the in-game encyclopaedia in both games are utter garbage, you will need to use Google. The enemies in WoTR require a better understanding of the systems, with all sorts of immunities and resistances among them. KM has more traditional CRPG monsters that act as you expect, and in one of the lone instances of resistances being important it dedicates multiple encounters and scenes to educating you on this. KM won’t Pathfinder you quite as hard as WoTR will, and WoTR also has a more brutal difficulty curve.

If you’re big on your CRPGs though, you should find time for both. Owlcat is a name that’s on the rise, and I will be buying anything they put out, or I will twelve months after they put it out. These are also very buggy games, even playing it more than a year after launch I didn’t get through a single WoTR session where I didn’t file a bug report. Maybe give it another year in the oven.

Impressions generally seem to have the following common points-

\-Lots of weapon variety and customization.  
\-Combat feels good and is fun, but not the best first-person melee ever.  
\-FLESH system is the game's biggest innovation.  
\-Fighting basic zombies can get repetitive & encounter design isn't always great.  
\-World is small and surprisingly linear (even compared to the first game), but pretty to look at.  
\-Characters may have custom elements to their stories.  
\-Feels like a game from the 360/PS3 era in terms of design, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

Should be interesting to see how this game shakes out, especially compared to Dying Light 2, which was received less warmly by the community than the first overall.

279,"Unnecessarily long grinds, who are the for?",11qbh30,"I’m not talking about grinding for levels in an RPG but when a game wants you to grind for something you don’t need who is it for? 

I’m currently playing like a dragon Ishin and the grind is so unnecessarily long I wonder why they would do it 

You have to make one of every weapon and that requires grinding for money and materials which means running through the same dungeons over and over until the RNG gods bless you with the item you want 

This can take hours just to get enough items to craft a single piece of equipment and if that wasn’t enough you need to get seals and use them all which means you could have to grind to make the same piece of equipment dozens of times just hoping the next time you’ll get the seal 

This is just one example there are numerous games out there that require insane grinds like this to 100% them and I wonder who is it for? Would people complain if grinds like this weren’t in games?

Why can't game studios get past their angsty phase, and make games that are a little brighter, and have fun in the writing and presentation of the game? Like you can have serious elements to your  game without everything being super dark, and you can have combat without making every NPC sound like some psychopathic killer.

It  even goes down to art style and music: There isn't any ""fun"" music in most games, it's just super serious cinematic orchestra, and there isn't any kinda cartoony art, it's all gotta be ""realism"" and look/run like shit.

Why are game devs, and especially MMO devs, so edgy? It seems like the only games that weren't grimdark are from 30 years ago, with the VERY OCCASIONAL game like Hifi Rush that isn't extra edge at all times -- as far as MMOs go, the only ones I can think of that weren't edgy were Wildstar and Maplestory / Maplestory 2.

297,In defense of Preston Garvey [discussion],11pufp9,"Ok ok I know! Preston sucks! Everyone here agrees Preston Garvey sucks.

But let’s take a step back and see it from his shoes alright?

First he’s got a platoon he’s running with. A group called the minutemen. Military wannabes who just want to help the people however they can.

However little by little they’re outnumbered and picked off until Preston’s just left with:

- an old drug loving seer 

-two regular civilians who don’t really know anything about combat

- a mechanic

- and someone who lost their brother and also doesn’t know combat

So in this case Preston’s the only be who knows anything about combat. And then the player shows up and saves him and his group from a raider attack they had no way of getting out of on their own

Afterwards the player leads the group to a nice place to be safe.

And what does Garvey do? He doesn’t give up on what he believes in. He sticks to the minutemen by letting this new person who just saved them go out and help others in the wastelands while he sticks around and protects the friends he’s made. Why?

Well if you were him, what would you do?

-go out on your own with limited supplies and possibly get killed

Or

-send a new friend who’s a combat veteran off to help other people who are in need of it. (…. Nate’s the veteran. Nora’s just a tough cookie)

I know what I’d choose. I’d be like Garvey and stick close to my friends.

That is until that certain new general turns traitor and joins raiders! THAT EARNS A LASER TO THE FACE, SON!

Anyway yeah I think Garvey was just doing what he thought was best.

Sometimes when reviewing a game I will feel a game’s focus is not particularly about the gameplay, and then people will disagree and say games should be primarily about the gameplay and be confused about how I scored a game. RPGs are often a good example. Sometimes the gameplay is poor when taken alone, but the gameplay serves more as a means to provide a backdrop to the world, characters, story, and emotions it evokes that stick with you for years.  

Obviously a competitive multiplayer game will focus on the gameplay, but that just shows the variety of experiences videogames can provide.

In the year 2151, the world is under attack by the forces of Hell. Giant demons, led by the powerful Khan Maykr, have invaded Earth, and the only hope for humanity is the Armored Response Coalition (ARC), a group of elite soldiers who pilot giant mechs known as Titans.

The ARC is led by the tough-as-nails General Hayden, who has made it his mission to protect humanity from the demonic threat. But even with the Titans, the ARC is outnumbered and outgunned by the demonic horde.

That's when the Doom Slayer arrives. He's a mysterious warrior with unmatched combat skills and a reputation for taking down demons. The ARC is skeptical of him at first, but when they witness him in action, they realize that he might just be their best chance at stopping the demonic invasion.

Together, the Doom Slayer and the ARC launch a counterattack against the demons. They battle through city streets and underground tunnels, facing off against the hordes of hellspawn that stand in their way.

But the Doom Slayer has a secret weapon - the Crucible, a powerful sword that can cut through anything, including demons. With the Crucible in hand, the Doom Slayer leads the charge against the demons, carving a path of destruction through their ranks.

As they fight their way deeper into the heart of the demon invasion, they discover that the Khan Maykr is using an ancient machine known as the Icon of Sin to power her army. The ARC and the Doom Slayer know that they have to destroy the Icon of Sin if they have any hope of stopping the invasion.

In a final battle for the fate of humanity, the ARC unleashes their Titans against the demons while the Doom Slayer fights his way to the Icon of Sin. The battle is intense, and it looks like all is lost, but the Doom Slayer manages to destroy the Icon of Sin with the power of the Crucible.

The demons are defeated, and humanity is saved thanks to the bravery of the ARC and the unstoppable force that is the Doom Slayer.

Since I got in possession of a good PC with dual monitor setup, I can't stop playing games that doesn't require my full attention and watch YouTube videos or Twitch livestreams on my second monitor.

Lately, I've been playing a whole lot of Skyrim, Subnautica and Total War Warhammer while watching a playthrough of any of these 3 games at the same time and, if not, watching a random Twitch livestream.

This habit is so bad that I stopped playing God of War Ragnarok on PS5 mid-way through the game (even though I was completely enjoying it) to return to my PC.  

As I have my PC setup in my living room next to my TV, I told myself that I would buy an extra HDMI cable so that I can play my PC games on the TV with a controller, stuff like Dead Space Remake for example. I bought the HDMI cable but haven't done any of what I had planned.

To give more background, prior to having a dual monitor setup, I almost completely stopped playing video games to only watch Twitch livestreams. Now it's a bit better but I still wanna go a step further in defeating my addiction to video game playthroughs/livestreams.

1,I have now finished every mainline Devil May Cry game this year. Here are some reviews from a first timer!,11wfl35,"Hello everyone! After years of looking at the Devil May Cry series and being curious about it I have finally decided to take the plunge this year and give it a go in preparation for FFXVI. I thought it would be fun to do a final review of all the games to reflect on each one. If you're interested in this kind of thing I hope you enjoy these thoughts from a total newbie!

**Disclaimer: I am not an official reviewer, so these ""reviews"" are more of just my thoughts on the games and will definitely not be professional. Also, keep in mind that for my scores on each game: rather than reviewing them critically, I factor in my personal enjoyment more than how a critic might review the game. So if a score seems either higher or lower than what might seem fair to you, that is because of this personal enjoyment factor. Also this will end up being a long ass post**

Alright, *Lets rock baby!*

**Devil May Cry 1**

I of course started with none other than DMC1. I am aware of how this game was originally supposed to be a resident evil game, and it damn well shows. Considering how much I love RE, I felt right at home with this game.

*Pros:*

-Right off the bat were treated with an absolutely Bonkers intro with trish beating the shit out of Dante, electrocuting him, thrusting a sword through him, throwing a fucking motorcycle at him and I loved every second of it. I knew right from the start I was in for a different kind of game.

-This game just oozes atmosphere akin to the RE series. The dark moody theme of castle, creepy and brilliant enemy designs (Shoutout to the spine shivering cackles of the scissors), etc, this games theme is awesome.

-Combat in this game is suprisingly cool for its time. It was awesome to see a game from back then having intricacies in its combat system such as having to wait before inputs to do different combo chains, the amount of different options you have at your disposal, and the combo potential. I really appreciated this aspect of the game and couldn't wait to see how it progressed.

-CCC: Classic Capcom Cheesiness. For some I could see this being a negative but for me, again, this game felt super close to RE and I loved that aspect of the game. While the story might come off as silly, I enjoyed this older era classic capcom esque story and voice acting. For me its very charming.

-Music: Theres some cool tracks in this game including everyones favorite PTSD theme, battle theme 2

*Cons:*

**Something Interesting I've noticed about the DMC series is that I would have the same cons almost throughout the entire series : Camera, Platforming, enemy design**

-Camera: DMC 1 uses a fixed camera system and while not too annoying in a RE game, in a high paced action game like DMC it can definitely get on your nerves. When you are fighting enemies that are hitting you from off screen, getting disoriented in high stakes moments or trying to jump on certain things it definitely detracts from the experience in a significant way

-Platforming: Platforming seems to be a common aspect of the entire series and while it might not be too annoying on its own, coupled with the camera system there are some moments that can get absolutely frustrating when youre unable to correctly judge where you're jumping. It isn't as bad in this game as it is in the later games but it's still there enough to get annoying

-Underwater levels: Look, I get it. This feature was probably included at the time as a gimmick to try something new but they really arent engaging at all and slow down the pace considering how slow and cumbersome they are. Luckily theres only like 2 or three sections so they don't overstay their welcome.

-Enemy design: This is another negative that is worse in some of the later titles but isnt TOO bad in DMC1, but there are definitely some enemy types that can be annoying to fight in this game as well. I think one of the biggest detractors from the series as a whole is that the combat itself is *awesome* but the enemies you fight at times make the combat worse because of how annoying it can make the gameplay. This is a real shame considering how great the combat is when you get to fight non annoying enemies. I also am not in love with the idea of fighting bosses multiple times. Again, not a huge issue here, but in general im just not a fan, which you could disagree with (even considering the fights change as you go on). On that note, RIP Griffin and fuck you Nightmare

**Final Score: 7/10**

A good entry to the series but not quite amazing. The combat is fun, the story is batshit insane with classic capcom cheesiness, and the atmosphere is chilling, but the game does have some older school jank that holds it back from being higher for me. Still an enjoyable experience.

**Devil May Cry 2**

When looking up the DMC series I was aware of how disliked this game is. It goes so far that people say to skip this game often. Now, I am someone who makes my own opinions for myself and often have unpopular opinions (as you might find in this post) so considering that, I wanted to play the game for myself and decide: Was this game REALLY that bad? Or was it just misunderstood?

Unfortunately, the opinions on this game couldnt have been more right..

*Pros:*

-uh, Dante's outfit is pretty sick?

-I like how Dante killed the last boss

*Cons:*

Man, where to start with this game. For me, this entire game is a con. Im going to keep it short and simple so that Im not here all day being a buzzkill. The combat in this game is just not rewarding. Youre encouraged to just spam your gun the entire game which makes everything else pointless unlike DMC 1. The enemy design is atrocious  and borderline broken at times where you can just spam your gun while they cant even hit you. The music is just there. The story is basically nonexistent, with like 2 new characters that end up feeling meaningless. The level design is boring and dragged out. And on top of all of this, the three kings of faults return here: Camera, platforming, and enemy design.

**Final score: 0/10**

Now hear me out. A critic might give this game a 2/10 or a 4 simply for being a game that is playable. But like I said in my disclaimer, my personal enjoyment weighs heavy into my personal review for the game, and with this game I found nothing that was worth my time. The combat, music, story, characters, gameplay, level design, enemy design, EVERYTHING provided nothing of value to me. This game is worse than just a bad game IMO, its a *nothing* game. You feel complete emptiness while playing it. When you're playing it all you can think of is why am I spending my time doing something I am getting 0 value out of. I went into this game with an open heart, even remarking about how cool dante's movement looks when you start the game, and even then the game made me dislike it. If you are a fan of DMC2 I hope you dont take this personally and more power to you for liking the game! For me though, man this game is the *worst* game Ive ever played in my life. I am not saying that lightly, I literally mean this is the worst game I've ever played. Even a broken game like Sonic 06 has aspects like character moments that you can get some sort of value out of. This game just wasnt for me

**Devil May Cry 3**

*This is where the fun begins*

Devil May Cry 3 is where DMC makes its return as we come back with a prequel featuring a much younger and crazier Dante. This is Dante like I hadn't seen in the previous 2 games, and while the immediate shift was slightly jarring, I ended up loving this character SO much more because of this game

*Pros:*

-With the opening cutscene of this game I came away with one impression which is: The devs made this game to be *seen*. What do I mean by that? Right from the start of the game everything just gives off the impression that the devs put an immense amount of love into this game. The choreography as Dante flies around the room slaying demons, the humor of the scene, how batshit crazy and insane it all is, the characterization of Dante that becomes apparent just within a few minutes. This game gives off the impression of ""Were not just making a game to be sold, we put time and effort into this shit and we want you to be wowwed by it"". Awesome stuff.

-I made a post when I first started playing this game that it had the best combat I had ever seen in an action game, and I meant it. Holy shit dude. The combos, the styles, the weapons, the combo chain potential, the weight of each move. This game's combat system is *fucking awesome*. Its like they took what they started with DMC 1 and completely revolutionized it. Ive played a lot of action games and I cant stress enough how dissapointed I get when they just give you a light and heavy button and maybe one special movie. Combat in this game is S tier

-The story: This is the first DMC game where I felt genuinely invested in the storyline. The brotherhood rivalry between Dante and Vergil is so cool and interesting, and subplots like with Lady, her growing connection with dante and how she handles her dad is interesting as well.

-Dante: Dante is fucking crazy in this game and I love it. I'd often want to continue playing just to see what sort of bullshit hed be up to next. He is an awesome character, and while I did like the more reserved dante of DMC1, this Dante is just a marvel to watch as he does crazy shit. I also love that he still has a more serious side as we can see he does care for his brother

-Being able to fight during the credits is so sick and an awesome way to finish a game. I'd never seen this before and it really makes such a nice last impression

-*JACKPOT*

*Cons:*

-Again the three kings of faults make their return, do I gotta say it? Camera, platforming, enemy design

-Camera in this game still can be a nightmare to deal with at times when youre getting bombarded by tons of demons. The platforming sections begin to get longer in these games as well and coupled together these two aspects can be so frustrating at times.

-Enemy design. I cant lie guys, there are some fucking annoying enemies in this game. The Chess piece enemy types stick out in particular as they are just straight up not fun to fight in my opinion. It just feels like youre hitting a wall with a sword, which to be fair is basically what they are, but is not fun. Again, a huge issue I have overall with the series is that while the combat system is S tier, the enemy types and encounters can effectively make that combat system worse when they limit what youre able to do with your moves. It really drags down the experience at times.

-Boss rush: This seems to be a either love it or hate it type of thing. For me, Im not into it. I think Boss rush mechanics are better suited to either specific boss rush games or side modes, but here Im just not really a fan. Now, in this game I dont really think the boss rush was lazy per say considering how much love was put into the rest of the game, but that is different in the next game...

-Later levels can feel drawn out: Personally I feel like the pacing of the game kind of slows down a lot near some of the later levels. Some of the level design and levels in general felt kind of drawn out to me and im not sure if that was just me.

**Final score: 8/10**

Dmc 3 is a great game. I loved the new take on dante, how fucking awesome combat is and the storyline. Unfortunately for me the enemy design, pacing, and camera do detract in a significant enough way to hold me back from saying that its amazing, but I did still enjoy it. I know a lot of people put this up there as a 10/10 game so I hope you dont hate me for disagreeing!

**Devil May Cry 4**

Two more to go. DMC4 stars a new protagonist, Nero, as we follow his journey among other characters of the OG cast. For me, I was really hoping to like this game, but overall it feels to me like 1 step forward, 5 steps back.

*Pros:*

-Combat in this game, while missing some aspects from DMC3, feels like they took Dmc3s combat, refined it, and just made it feel smoother to play. It is very good and I would go as far to say that the combat system as a standalone is better than DMC3.

-Nero is pretty cool. Sure, he's an angsty teen type character but I'm happy to say I came away from the game liking him. The addition of his Devil bringer grapple where you can pull enemies towards you is just an awesome addition and I love how he feels totally different to play from Dante

-Dante is fun as HELL to play as. I liked playing as dante so much in this game that it really saved the second half of the game for me.

-The Post credit scene with Dante, Trish, and Lady is S tier. I LOVE how theyve become like a little family and how when Dante starts doing some dumbass shit, Lady and Trish back him up with equal dumbassery. Love them

*Cons:*

Unfortunately while combat feels more refined here, it also feels like this game took every con in Dmc3 and made it worse

It's no secret that this game had some development issues and it really shows. For starters the whole second half of the game is basically backtracking through every level you've played before hand in the opposite direction with some new additions. Luckily, Dante was so fun to play as that I didnt hate this as much as I could have, but after all this backtracking what are we met with?

-Another boss rush. Remember how I said in Dmc3 I wouldnt call the boss rush in that game lazy because the rest of the game had love and care? In this game it's the opposite. Because the rest of the game is lacking the boss rush here just feels like a lazy way to extend gameplay time. It was this boss rush that really just made me tired of the mechanic as a whole.

-The story and characters in this game are unfortunately just really uninteresting. I didnt care for the storyline here like I did in Dmc3 and its a shame characters like Kyrie are essentially just wasted.

-The platforming in this game along with the devil bringer and camera can just be god awful. Some of the most frustrating of the series

-Enemy designs again in this game just become straight up annoying and unfun to fight against. This coupled with the rest of the games faults really drag the combat down for me.

**Final score: 5/10**

Again, probably a lower score than most would give it, but enjoyment wise I just felt burnt out by the end of the game. Coming away from it I really could only say that I liked the improved feel of the combat, but even that was dragged down by level design and enemy design. The story didn't interest me and characters felt wasted. I was hoping better for this game but it really is apparent it needed more time. I dont hate it, I just didnt have the best experience with it

**Devil May Cry 5**

Here we are at the final game. Going into Dmc5 I was really, really hoping that this would be the DMC that id finish and think was amazing. Dont get me wrong, I have very much enjoyed playing through the series up until this point, but each game I played came with significant flaws that would detract from my overall enjoyment.

*I am very proud to say, I fucking Love DMC5*

*Pros*

-Dmc5 feels to me like a love letter to everything that DMC is as a series. Everything is back and better than ever with tons of fan service done in a tasteful way. To be clear, by fanservice I dont mean just throwing in old stuff for brownie points, rather that the devs truly understand what you loved about the past games and is giving you what you want.

-Story in this game is fucking awesome, a closely knit family story between certain characters that is just badass and interesting the entire way through. TONS of absolutely amazing eye candy scenes that are a marvel to watch.

-Characters are the best they ever been, and this is for almost every character. Nero, Dante, Virgil, Nico, I loved them all. Unfortunately my one gripe is that it seems like Lady and Trish got a bit of the back seat here but it's understandable because it's not really their story.

-Combat: **THIS is what ive been waiting for.** Combat here feels perfected. Everything that was great about DMC3/4s system not only returns, but is expanded. An absolute BONKERS amount of options and weapons at your disposal and FINALLY we get to enjoy this amazing combat system without the camera fucking us over constantly. Enemy design here is finally not an issue anymore as well. I think there was maybe one boss that I throught was a little iffy? But aside from that the enemy design is done well and you finally get to enjoy the combat system without it being held back by other factors. I actually think this is the best action combat I've seen in a game.

-Speaking of combat, this game gave me the most satisfying and rewarding moment I've ever had in an action combat game. I was in one of those states where youre just in the zone, flipping back and forth between weapons, keeping the momentum up. I was knocking this enemy between land and air, connecting things seemlessly, and right as I charged up my final finisher move the game goes into a slow mo and SMOKIN SEXY STYLE fires off as I finish the chain. I got goosebumps because of how sick it was (I know I sound like a gamespot reviewer right now, but its true!). It was the most satisfying thing I've ever experienced in an action game bar none.

-The music in this game is BUMPIN. Special shoutout to the remix of shadow's theme from DMC1. Everytime Neros theme comes on in just makes me wanna kick some ass.

-Level design is much better in this game and is rarely every annoying or overstays its welcome

-""Don't you dare say it!""

*Cons*

-Personally I kind of wish there would have been some more variety with the level design from a pure aesthetic standpoint. A lot of the environments look very samey, although I did really like the City Locale at the start and the last area where you fight Vergil

-I know this point may be controversial but I want you to keep in mind that this is just my personal opinon and am not making the point that it is an objective fact: I really dislike playing as V. While I admire them adding a new type of character that plays totally different, to me V just feels really clunky and overall unfun to play as. It feels as though his combat system just isnt fully refined yet and can be frustrating when certain things happen like shadow not doing what you want him to do or your demons abilities being tied to your own movements. For example if Im trying to evade an attack by moving back, Griffin will do his little energy release thing rather than keep shooting forward. Overall I just really hated these sections, Im not gonna lie. I think this is a concept that is cool in though but was not excecuted well. Again, this is just how I personally feel but I am not going to say V is bad from an objective stand point. It just personally wasnt for me

**Overall Score: 9/10**

Dmc5 is a near perfect game. Unfortunately when thinking about my score for this game I just couldnt push aside how much the V sections detracted for me. Almost everything else about this game though is fucking awesome, and I believe this is one of the best action games I've ever played. This game feels like a love letter to every fan of the series, and I feel like playing the other 4 games first made me enjoy this game so much more than I would have otherwise considering how much love is put in there for DMC fans. This game was the first in the series that I actually felt bittersweet when I finished playing because of how much I loved going through it. At no point was there a section where I felt ""man can we just get on with this"" aside from the V sections. I really love this game

**Final Thoughts:**

So there you have it! I had a ton of fun playing through this series for the first time ever this year. The series is awesome with a ton of good things, some bad, but overall a very enjoyable experience that Im glad to have played through. Im happy to know who these characters are now, their stories, and how awesome the combat can be in these games. Now Im really just craving a DMC6.

Sorry for such a long ass post but if you made it this far I really appreciate you checking out my thoughts and would love to hear what you Disagree or agree on! It was a blast being able to play all these games and reflect on each one. Now im off to finish Dino Crisis, peace!

3,I just can't stay on one game for very long...,11wbfj1,"So I'm a big gamer, ya see? I play a lot of games, mostly on PC (and more recently my steam deck), to the point where I have more than 120 games on Steam (123 to be exact) I even have a few 100s of hours on some of them, manly Terraria, Satisfactory, Hollow Knight, Spelunky 2 and most importantly, Minecraft

But I often see people with playing times in the thousands, and I just don't know how... There are Youtubers and Streamers who can play the same game for years, doing challenges and installing mods, but without getting bored

Meanwhile, the longest amount of time I've been on a game recently is about a couple of months, maybe 6 at best. And it's an exception. The only games I stayed interested in for this long were Spelunky 2, the Binding of Isaac, Bloons TD 6... And I'm pretty sure that's it. (there was also Minecraft which I used to play for months and months when I was pretty young, but that spark never lit up again...)

And don't get me started on Multiplayer. As soon as a week of playing a game with my friends goes by, I just don't want to play anymore, or at least not for very long... Minecraft, Deep Rock Galactic (rock and stone), Overcooked 2, Stardew Valley, wether it be with my friends or my family (mainly my father), multiplayer games are just annoying to me because of this horrible trait that I have. I think it's got something to do with my brain realizing, at some point during the session, that I can't really chose when I want to stop playing (which is kinda wrong, and kinda true), and from that point forward, I just stop having any fun on the game to the point where I avoid playing it with my friends entirely 

So I'm here to ask for some advices. There are a lot of games I want to play, and not just for a couple of hours. Rhythm games likes osu!, survival/""sandbox"" games like Stardew Valley, story or exploration games like Outer Wilds or Return of the Obra Dinn, but I just can't, and I don't know how to fix that...

Also, this is not related to gaming, but I basically have the same issue in my day to day life with working on my personal projects, so any tips you'd give me could be helpful there too

But here I'm just asking about the gaming part. Any advices on things I should do or try?",DarkFluo,35,1,0.55

5,What single player game stories do you think can *ONLY* work as a video game? More info in the description. Spoilers for TLOU2.,11w9o6c,"By this I mean....something like the Legacy Of Kain series for example I could easily see working as a movie or book series. It's a fantastic franchise (one of my favorite) and has a great story, but it's something that isn't dependent or profound due to specifically video gaming as a medium. Same thing with something like Xenogears. To be honest, I would kind of prefer Xenogears as a book, manga, or TV series (assuming it was done right) lol.

Contrary, I feel like stuff like Ico, Shadow Of The Colossus, The Last Of Us (this one might be kind of controversial), etc. Things where the gameplay itself contributes significantly to the experience. For example The Last Of Us. I do think the show is very good, however I feel like many moments hit harder through being a video game because in many of the tough scenes *you* are physically the one committing the violence (or whatever else it is) so it may hit some players harder because of that. I know that specifically in TLOU2, there are many sections that I can't imagine being as compelling through strictly a visual medium. Some of the sections hit harder because as much as I didn't want to personally do XYZ, *I personally had to make those actions happen to progress the story*. It wasn't Ellie on screen drowning Abby, it was ME drowning Abby...etc. Same thing with Bioshock 1. The twist hits harder because you feel like you were personally tricked. I don't think it would land as hard as a show or in a book. 

The obvious low hanging fruit would be open world titles where you can do whatever you want, whenever, and games where you have the option of multiple choices to determine the story. I would prefer to stay away from games like thar if possible, but you're free to suggest them if you can't think of anything else. Souls titles are also kinda low hanging fruit since they are basically entirely about your personal resolve and willpower in overcoming an obstacle. I feel like those games are played more ""outside"" of the game than in them, if that makes sense (ie the biggest part of the game is your mental fortitude, not anything else).

7,Is steam deck right for me?,11w2zxl,"Hi all,


I am considering buying a steam deck, but I am not sure if this device is the right choice for me.

I am planning to play mostly double-A and indie games, and also some early 2000s such as dungeon siege, dragons dogma, gothic, etc.

My main concerns are battery life and the overall size of this device. I want to use it for the emulation of PlayStation 2, dreamcast, and maybe some ps3 but this part is not as essential to me.

More important are cloud gaming and streaming services (Nvidia, Xbox, PS5, etc).

It would be nice to know if playing android games is also possible. I read somewhere that you can emulate the android environment.

I don't travel a lot, so I will use the handheld in my bed or while laying on the sofa, but at some point, I am going to shove it into my backpack and go abroad.

I do consider the following handhelds:

1. Steam Deck - good ps2, ps3 emulation, I love the steam environment, but the device seems bulky and the battery apparently can hold about 1-2h if you playing newish games.

2. Odin Pro - I like the design, it's relatively pocketable, it has analog triggers (unlike RetroidPocket3), good battery life, and good android performance, also seems perfect for streaming/cloud gaming. Ps2 emulation is a bit wonky but this is a secondary priority for me. Don't know what the performance of the steam link looks like.
3. Ayn Loki Mini Pro (intel i3 1215u) - don't know much about this one, but it seems to be an upgraded version of Odin pro, but windows base.

Please advise,

Thanks!",JohnnyBravo655,8,5,0.78

Black Ops Cold War, The Modern Warfare 1&2 games, Vanguard, have all had their campaigns not available on the physical disc's and instead forced consumers to go online to download them which is a weird decision imo. 

The old Call Of Duty Games such as Ghosts, Black Ops III, Advanced Warfare, Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, World War II all have the full campaigns on disc and ready to play at launch with no need to go online and download the packs just to enjoy the content that's suppose to be on disc.

I find COD MW2019 [hitmark sound](https://youtu.be/wz1PGK3gXXg) + gun recoil effect to be incredibly satisfying and was quite disappointed that it doesn't exist in the campaign. Overwatch headshot sound is iconic and incredibly satisfying too, the [crunch noise](https://youtu.be/3r1ILdlm750) when you land a headshot in Battlefield 5 (and the orange cracked skull you get on screen after landing it), or the hitmarker that gets bigger and bigger the more damage you deal in Battlefield 1, or the really loud [shield cracking sound in Fortnite](https://youtu.be/J0lQO26geIo).

I get that the main purpose of hitmarkers is to give feedback during fast paced moments.

Sam could have taken Rafe’s offer and left Nathan out of it, or he could have asked Nathan directly if he wanted to go after it.  Instead he lies to his gone-legit brother about it being a matter of life and death.  Potentially getting him killed or arrested.

Also, at the end when Sam ran off to get the treasure instead of getting away with everyone, he was either idiotic, or delusional.  The bad guys had the treasure, they would never have let him leave with it.  But he runs back seemingly just so his ego can tell himself he got to it first.

1. Buy a new PC there - which I'm not too keen on for the hassle tbh. I don't know if I'm gonna stay in the same city that I'm doing my masters in, and I can always buy something for now and build once in 3-4 years time once I have money there.
2. Buy a gaming laptop - I already have a MacBook which I'll likely be using for college due to the battery + portability. So investing $1500 or so on a laptop which I won't use much outside of gaming, I'm not entirely sure. But this does allow me to use my entire PC library + gamepass.
3. Buy a steam deck - I'm not sure this is good enough as a daily driver. The smaller screen and performance are also not the best parts, and I'm not sure about the longetivity. But it's cheap, and I've heard good things about it.

It’s always fun seeing who gets added to the roster and making predictions, both likely and complete wildcards, was a fun thing to speculate on while the game was active.

If I had to pick a character I both really want to see and think is incredibly likely to join the cast at some point, it would be Dante from Devil May Cry. It would be fun to see how they translate his mechanics and blend all his styles into a single moveset. Or maybe he can be a gimmick fighter where his down-B can cycle him between his styles and maybe change up his standing B. Could easily be one of the most versatile fighters in the roster and a blast to play. Another fairly likely pick for me would be either Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, or both.

I have two wildcards and no idea how they’d fight, but I want to see them regardless, even though it’ll probably never happen. The first one for me is Shantae. She will definitely never join the roster, but I will be there day one if it ever does. Another wildcard, albeit one that’s a little closer in the realm of possibility, would be some Guilty Gear representation. Since we already have Street Fighter, Tekken, and KoF, Mortal Kombat will probably be the next to get representation (and it’ll definitely be Scorpion or Sub Zero), but it would be amazing to see Sol Badguy, Ky Kiske, or (my favorite) May join the roster.

108,Tips for first person shooters with a controller,11u2myz,"Old-ass, lifelong PC gamer here.

I recently switched to mainly gaming on an Xbox Series X because, over the years, I developed a preference for gaming in my living room, on a couch, on a bigger screen. I'm just tired of sitting at my desk because it's kind of isolating... so I decided to take a break from it. Gaming on the couch is kind of ""freeing"". My wife (or my pets) can more easily hang out with me or sit with me while I game. My wife and I also play more co-op games now, and gaming on a 65'' screen is a nice change...

I consider myself a pretty decently ""skilled"" gamer. Played many competitive games throughout the years and I have usually no issues whatsoever beating most games on ""hard"" or ""very hard"" difficulties.

I'd say the games I excel the most at are ""Souls""-like games, Adventure/RPGs, platformers and, I USED to be good at first person shooters... that is, until I played one with a controller.

I am ***NOT*** here to start a PC/console argument. That's stupid. It's just that there are a lot of interesting FPS games on Xbox and no matter how much I try, I just can't seem to do it... I have trouble aiming. YES, I could probably easily just buy it on Steam and play on my PC instead, but I want to challenge myself. I want to become good with a controller. The upcoming game [Starfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfield_(video_game)) is also a reason I'm motivated to become prolific with a controller.

I wanted to know: Do most console FPS competitive players play with an ""Elite"": style controller with paddles and customizable thumbstick resistances and inputs? Is it ***necessary*** to invest in one of these to step up your game? Or are there high-level players who manage with a standard controller?

Any tips for options in the game? My main issue is really ***aiming***... After 30+ years of aiming with a mouse, I have a really hard time aiming with thumbsticks. Auto-aim options help a little but no much. I feel like there's something I must be doing wrong. Everything feels clunky and if I want to aim a particular part of the enemy's body, it seems impossible.

I'm honestly feeling a bit tempted to get the Steam Deck at its reduced price, going for about 360 excl. sales tax (which would probably bring it to around 380. The thing is, I don't know if this means it may get even cheaper in the future with other holiday sales, or if this is just a special occasion since it's the anniversary of its release, and may never happen again.

I will say that I do have about 500 games in my Steam library, over half of which are indies that would be Deck compatible, but I also have a couple Surface computers, which supposedly should be able to run them fine. Of course, when I do try to run even the simplest games, they cause my computers to overheat and occasionally freeze up.   I do also have a Switch and Playstation 4, which were gifts for finishing school, and I'd feel guilty leaving them behind since they were from my family. Also there are some nice looking exclusives for Nintendo on the horizon, but I'm not entirely sure how future proofed my libraries on either system would be for generations to come.

I just feel like I'd be gluttonous if I got a whole other system just for the sake of future proofing, especially since it sounds like there may be an improved hardware in a few years.

128,Exoprimal first impressions,11ttnpc,"80s B-movie setting meets early 90s arcade design meets early 20s graphics.  

And it's fucking glorious.

The beta opening could've been titled ""throwback Thursday"" because for those of us who are routinely checking our 401k and making sure we take ibuprofen because our back is hurting instantly recognize the feel of exoprimal for what it is. A direct descendant of the near mindless action and chaos inherent to the arcade games of the late '80s and early '90s. Include a variety of gameplay styles via the assorted suits and optional kits and you end up with the unplug your brain at the door appeal of an arcade game but with modern sensibilities.

Speaking of modern sensibilities, I'm less than thrilled to note the suggested presence of the now ubiquitous battle pass upon release but I'm not seeing how we really get away from those anymore. It does prompt thoughts of avoiding purchasing the game at retail and instead playing the game via the game pass option on the platform of your choice.

But back to the game. Each of the exosuits absolutely play with a unique style even within the overarching classes of support, tank, and assault.  It goes a long way to the credit of the development team that the feel of each suit has its own striking design as well as its own one-liners, making the claim of each suit having its own personality a literal as well as figurative statement.  The designs are also very well done and have faint echoes of the javelins from Anthem which is not a bad thing at all (regardless of how folks felt about the rest of that particular game).

With the majority of gameplay involving four players, there's a lot going on on screen but I have not run into any noticeable slow down played on the PS5. A bit surprising but a testament to the balancing act between visual necessity and visually striking. This is a game that could have been submerged in lighting and particle effects in short order but it appears that fact was recognized and steps taken to avoid it.

PvE gameplay is extraordinarily straightforward. Shoot until everything stops moving. Thus far there's a variety of escort, assault, and defense objectives in the various missions, but it's all chrome spinners and fuzzy dice attached to a, dare I say prehistoric, gameplay objective of kill everything that is not you. The dinosaurs have been categorized to provide the usual gamut of grunt hordes, flyers, tanks, etc. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs are, well, dinosaurs and aside from the mutated variants aren't too visually arresting but for the real estate they occupy on the screen. To be fair, even without flashy lights and wild paint jobs, it does make your blood run cool for a second to have a T-Rex pop out of a yawning black portal with the intention of taking a bite out of your ass.

PVP may give Capcom a bit of a headache because I'm already seeing instances where certain suits are much more suited than others to this style of combat. To talk out of the other side of my mouth,  the game also allows for on the fly changing of suits So adaptation is not only key but may also provide the developers a way to side step trying to perfectly balance 10 unique suits for both PVE and PVP modes. Time will tell.

With how out of control the industry has gotten with epic blockbusters and franchises vomiting out new iterations every 18 months It seems fitting that exo primal features dinosaurs as it is certainly hearkening back to an earlier time. Back to a time when games weren't focused on photorealism, expensive voice actors, deep moral or ethical quandaries, or monetizing every fucking aspect possible. A time when the ultimate question was ""Is it fun?"".

Acknowledging that this is an open beta, for exoprimal, the answer thus far is a resounding ""yes"".",KingCarbon1807,3,1,0.6
129,Game idea. What are your thoughts?,11tr077,"Some of my ideas about an MMORPG. Personally I think that this game should focus on players of other types of games and not just to hardcore MMORPG players. Anyways, here we go. (5-6 mins reading)

**Playstyle**

The game has an action combat style where key sequences lead to even better combos like mortal combat, nothing too difficult (since ppl can just use macros to do them) just as much to make combat feel smooth. Skills will be like a branch, for example E > E > 1 is different than E > E > 3 etc. Leveling gives you points that you use to go further to the branch of each skill. Balancing those skills is important so that ppl dont use the same skills repeatedly. In the end of a branch you will get something like a buff so pretty much you have to use all branches. Some parts of gear will buff some skills so you might want to use them more etc. I kindly hate metas and i think balancing skills can let ppl have their own playstyles instead of using the best one.


**Classes**

There will be a lot of classes (some of them will be locked by race). The combination of class and race will make a “hero”. Some heroes can be used by all races and some others due to lore will be locked to a single race. Pretty much if you are tired of the hero that you main, you can buy a new one (most likely it will be something like a weapon or a scroll) and a new tab will be available at your skill menu ( J key most likely 😂) where you can use the points to go further in the skill branches of the new hero (some skills will be locked because you have to master the hero to unlock them, most likely it will require you to do 1million damage with the previous skill or finish 100 npcs with that skill etc). Every new hero that will be released it will be available only by paying $$ until a newer hero get released 3-4 months later where the previous one will be available with ingame currency and goes on. I hate alt accounts or alt characters on mmo games because you either feel like you mastered your main one and want to try something new or you are forced to make one because of grind etc to feed main one and i think that in this way you dont have to make an alt except if you want to play that specific hero that is race locked. Last but not least, the holy trinity (tank, healer ,dps). I know that most ppl prefer dps classes but for those few ones who would like to play tank with every class possible and since heroes will be balanced in a way that everyone have a block, most classes will be able to tank but most likely not with the same difficulty. Healers will be linked with the tank and after dealing damage to boss a bar will get increased and healer will use that to heal. Some skills will use 20% of the bar while other skills will use the full bar etc. In the end of a skill branch all skills from 1-5 will become the same spell and if the player press 1 they will heal the 1st member of group, if they press 2 they will heal the 2nd member etc. For party heal and debuff removal there will be an aoe circle that player can see if everyone is inside and can be healed/blessed.


**PvE**

I hate when you have to reach endgame to engage with newer content or when a friend joins and they have to play 200 hours before you can play together. that being said there will be no endgame except raids

**Dungeons (5man, 20-30min long)**, there will be actual entrances to dungeons on world map but you will need something like an offering item that you have to use to enter, that been said, you wont be able to spam a single dungeon 100 times to progress on gear. Instead all dungeons will give what you need to progress depending on your level. In this way you play with older content too. So you may ask what if you run out of offering items? In this case, the dungeon finder window will open up and tell you to search for a random dungeon. What if you outlevel older dungeons? You actually wont, there will be a soft cap curve that even if you level higher the curve gets almost flat and you dont do any more damage. For example, you are lvl 100 and your friends are lvl 10, 34, 37, 43 and 46 respectively and you enter a 40lvl dungeon. Your lvls now will be (45, 35, 35, 37, 43 and 45 respectively) so pretty much a lower cap and higher cap of 5. In this way your lvl43 friend might do higher damage if you dont try your best. Lastly, i was also thinking about pve elo where dungeon gets more difficult depending on the group’s elo , so you still have fun doing dungeons you may did many times before.

**Raids (25man, 1.5h-2h long if done perfectly)**, as i said earlier raids will be endgame, that been said they will be locked behind story and some personal achievement that shows you are able to do raid’s mechanics such as clearing 10 times some difficult solo dungeon that have similar mechanics to the raid you want to enter (most ppl are afraid to take random to their raids because they feel like dealing with apes and might wipe them for hours long so they stick to their guilds)

world monster and bosses, nothing much to be said here, you get your reward based on your % you dealt


**PvP**

As i said earlier the combat system will be an improved version of combat system which is based on players skills only and gear wont matter. you can spam the block button like fighter style games but there is a window between them where enemy can engage, you can jump to avoid lower hits etc.. making pvp fast paced and increadible to watch. Anyways, after the first two chapter of story (tutorial) everyone can enter pvp matches and based on their elo they get similar elo enemies.

**Open world**, after each maintenance, game will ask each governor of a race to chose with which races he want peace and which war. In specific time of a day ppl can attack other races outside cities based on those decisions. (not so sure of open world pvp tbf, not my type.. might remove that)

**1v1** nothing to be said here, just an arena with balanced gears where only players’ skills matter

**5v5** (not sure if this should be in an arena as well or some other map like mobas or shooting games)

**50v50** (or more, depends if servers can handle) will be a siege type game where one team attacks and one defends.

**Monetization**

The game will be f2p, but people can buy monthly pass that gives them a sign near their name (like twitter blue 😂) and some other stuff but nothing special that would even make someone think its p2w. New heroes will be buyable till a newer one gets released (like i said in classes section). Skins and emotes on marketplace. And lastly dlcs. Those will be like prequels of movies, side stories that go deeper into lore and give you some skins etc. Nothing that you actually need to improve your gear.


**Story**

The game starts with a clip showing the lore of the game, not very long to be specific.. just some key events that happened in the past till the day you are born. In the first chapter you play as your actuall hero you created on character creation, in this chapter you learn about your class and going threw events that lead you to the 3rd chapter. In the second chapter, you play as kid version of your character till you reach the point you have grown to your actual created character, here you learn about the race you chose and what made you leave that place (in a race for example the village was destroyed, in some race you were recruited and in some other races you just stayed there) after 2nd chapter ends, a video plays and in the end it shows you were you started in 1st chapter. Those two chapters are something like a tutorial and they can be skipped at any time. In any case, in the 3rd chapter everyone is in the same city  and the story is the same for all races. There will be side stories where you learn more about a race and some events happened in the past (in the form of an expansion most likely). Mostly, you are not the main hero of the story (some chapter of story will focus on you as a being). Of course your actions have an impact to how story develops, but you are not “the chosen one” that will solve everything and bring balance to the force. There are beings that you cant beat alone even in endgame and some others who are blessed by gods etc whom power is even bigger etc (more about the story in the part where i explain the world). Anyways, the story is very important and it should be full of emotions. Some of your friends die, things dont go as planned, epic fights etc. Everything that makes a story stand out from the rest. No stupid quest like find some kid’s toy or collect 10x of those things that make no sense.


**World**

This game has ""everything"". A huge map that contains every region you can imagine, some races for example are: ancient Chinese, Egypt and Greece like, people who live in a snow place ( Vikings style), medieval, pirates , steampunk (a city like columbia from bioshock infinite, in this race gunner classes will be race locked), dwarfs (most likely a city in a mountain), elves and high elves (city on a huge tree), amazons (female muscle warriors like from futurama, 2-3 times bigger than other races), some little and cute race (like kirbies or yordles from lol), centaurs, half human half tiger/wolf race where you transform fully on human or animal, angles and demons (having wings and can fly slightly of ground instead of walking) and undead (skeletons, ghosts, spirits etc). As i said earlier about higher beings, there is a goddess of creation which had some children and they had theirs etc.. key points are also ascended city (like paradise), spirit realm/underworld/void and lastly the in-between (a place where you are judged by a higher being with an ancient scale. Some people are stuck there for centuries as a punishment from some god). There are also small maps for the steampunk city, in-between, ascended city and underworld. Lastly there is a single server for every region but it is divided into channels based on your ip address so that you can get the lowest ping or play with player with similar pink so you dont feel that you suck compared to others. Each channel has its own code e.g. #03939280. Of course you can change channels to join your friends but i guess that would need a loading screen.

138,The next generation of video games will have NPC's that can talk to you about anything for as long as you want. Then they'll become fully-interactive movies with any plot that you want.,11tovqg,"I've been messing around with ChatGPT for the past few weeks, and the thing is blowing my mind. I realized, obviously, that this technology can be slotted right into an RPG and allow you to talk to NPC's totally naturally about any topic (though I'm sure they'd be programmed to feign ignorance of things outside the game world). 

The first generation (which we may skip since the tech is developing so fast) may just have each NPC have a personality like ""bitter drunken fruit vendor,"" but the interaction will be on a totally new level. Imagine being able to go to a bar in Skyrim and just randomly talk to a guard about how he was trained and where he grew up. The game may forget the conversation right after, and it may have no effect on the game world, but just that blows my mind. It's obviously easy, I had ChatGPT simulate it for me already.

Then of course, the next generation will allow the conversations to effect the plot. The game will likely have enough memory to let what you say or hear change objectives sometimes in the story, and will know what each character said to you and what you said back.

After that, the games will obviously be able to generate any plot you want and let the plot fit your actions. ChatGPT can already make-up stories on the fly, the graphics engine needs only to be able to visualize what it says. It may take a few years, or maybe not at this rate.

I can definitely envision a future where there are posts on boards like ""How to turn Elders Scroll VII into a Skooma-dealing game, included map seed, which locations to visit and what to say to each NPC."" 

With deepfake technology, you'll even be able to include any actors who may agreed to appear in the game, in whatever roles you ask. Provided it's safe-for-work.

149,"Could someone here please help me find a 1990s Nintendo Power poster/ad featuring Banjo, Conker, and Yoshi in a rock band?",11tddg5," 

I think I still own this issue, but

1. I have no idea where it is.
2. I wouldn't know which issue it is.

However,  I've been wanting to find this image.  I called it a ""Poster/Ad""  because I am not sure which it was, but I'm leaning towards it being an  ad for renewing the subscription.  Either way, as I recall it was a  two-page spread with the caption, ""The Hits Just Keep On Coming!""  The  illustration was a band playing on stage, with Yoshi as the drummer and  Banjo and Conker on guitars/bass.  Link may or may not have been in the band, as I remember a picture of him with a guitar, but I'm not sure it was this one.  In the audience, Mario and Donkey  Kong were cheering.

Again I don't  remember the issue but some things can help narrow it down.  First, this  was made before Conker's WIP game got overhauled into *Bad Fur Day*,  causing NP to stop talking about it.  Second, while Banjo and Conker  might have been original art, I think the render of Yoshi was from *Yoshi's Story*.   *Banjo-Kazooie* was probably released by then, *Banjo-Tooie* was probably not.  So that would put this ad in the 1997-1999 range, I think.",Flodo_McFloodiloo,11,1,0.56

I have a few myself;

• Quicker load times
• Autosave
• Preloading
• Cloud saves

But I think the one I take for granted the most is the ability to pause a game during a cutscene. My attention span has never been great - I never stick to one thing for too long before doing something else to break up any tedium I might experience. Cutscenes are hit and miss. Some get to the point, others drag on for long periods of time.

Being able to pause during cutscenes is a godsend. If I could combine it with another thing I love about modern games, it'd be that and being able to put my console to sleep, so that not only do I get to wake up my console another time, but I won't have to reload and rewatch a long cutscenes from the start. If it was two generations prior, I wouldn't be able to do that. It's especially handy when I have to go somewhere.

Perfect example. I had to go to the toilet, so I was able to pause the cutscene and go to the bathroom, and also write this post.

Around about 2013, I was a massive Tomb Raider fan who decided to trade my PS4 in for an Xbox One at the time so that i wouldn't have to wait to play Rise Of The Tomb Raider. As time went by, Microsoft implemented backwards compatibility and then Gamepass.

By then, i was pretty much sticking with Xbox for the foreseeable future. I managed to grab a Series X on release and was blown away by how seamless everything was integrated & accessible on the now current gen console. It was quite amazing playing so many older titles with FPS boosts, increased resolution, etc. 

Playstation had slightly caught my attention with the wealth of incredible exclusives that they had been releasing constantly. In the last two years or so, there hadn't been many great Xbox Exclusives besides Gears 5  & Hi-Fi Rush IMO. It slowly dawned on me that my Series X had just been primarily playing games from last gen and even earlier. I took the leap last week and swapped my series x for a PS5.

Having not played a sony console in almost a decade, i was absolutely blown away by the wealth of content available on PS+/Sony Gamepass what ever you want to call it & then they even dropped the brand new horzion game on it last week.  Checked out Spiderman (PS5 Version) and was blown away by the visuals. Even though the series x is more powerful, i don't think I've seen a game look that incredible in a long time.

Recently, i just checked out the Resident Evil 4 Demo and OMFG, the adaptive triggers, the inbuilt mic speaker for Leon's communication, and the haptic vibration feedback. 
The bloody controller has blown me away. I had no idea how next gen it would actually feel compared to the xbox controller.

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft)

&#x200B;

>On 15 September 2014, Microsoft announced a $2.5 billion deal to buy Mojang, along with the ownership of the Minecraft intellectual property.\[120\]\[121\]\[122\] The deal was suggested by Persson when he posted a tweet asking a corporation to buy his share of the game after receiving criticism for enforcing terms in the game's end-user license agreement (EULA), which had been present in the EULA in the prior three years.\[123\]\[124\]\[125\] According to Persson, Mojang CEO Carl Manneh received a call from a Microsoft executive shortly after the tweet, asking if Persson was serious about a deal. Mojang was also approached by other companies including Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts.\[125\] **The deal with Microsoft was arbitrated on 6 November 2014 and led to Persson becoming one of Forbes' ""World's Billionaires""**

&#x200B;

Even if you wanted to be really really fucking stupid about the whole thing the game was released on the system the same month as MS announced a desire to buy the IP.  Which means Mojang would have already had months to negotiate with Sony for the port and to put in the effort to build the port before MS even registered the desire to buy it.  Due to the fact they would need to work with Sony to get PS4 development kits and the assorted legal work needed to release a game on a console.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yet I keep seeing people claim that MS allowed the game on PS3/PS4. And even getting angry when you point out that they did not.  The only system that MS can be given credit for releasing the game on is Nintendo as the Switch and New 3DS versions of the game came out in 2017. Which was of course 3 years give or take a couple of months after they acquired the IP rights.

202,What are your top 5 or 10 games/series that you want brought back or remade?,11s9pun,"These are my top 10, in no particular order...

* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 & 2
* Tenchu: Stealth Assassin
* Metal Gear Solid 1-4
* Condemned: Criminal Origins & Bloodshot (esp in VR!)
* Splinter Cell
* Syphon Filter
* Silent Hill 1 & 2
* Jade Empire (one of old school Bioware's best games)
* Fear Effect (unique, adult PS1 game that was 4 discs lol)
* Dino Crisis

I can think of a few others I'd love to be remade but those are probably my top 10. Some others I'd love to see brought back or remade would be the Driver series, Black (one of the best shooters on Xbox/PS2 and way ahead of its time), NFS Underground 2, the Killzone series, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Def Jam: Fight for New York (probably the most fun I ever had playing a fighting game & the music was great), Fable series, Parasite Eve, Beyond Good & Evil (weren't we supposed to get a sequel ages ago?), Shenmue, Fight Night series, Star Wars: Jedi Outcast and The Force Unleashed, Half Life series, Prince of Persia, GTA: San Andreas/Vice City and Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. So those are all the games that I believe are deserving of being brought back into the current generation or deserve remakes of the original games, if not entirely new games. 

I can't even imagine how sick the Condemned games would be in VR, they're literally *perfect* for it; first person melee combat, horror, creepy af atmosphere and cool detective/investigation mechanics. And I can't imagine how amazing Dino Crisis or Fear Effect could be with today's graphics and tech. So I'm curious what everyone else thinks are games deserving of being remade, and could actually be successful. Like I'd love a remake of Indigo Prophecy or Wild 9 but I know they likely wouldn't be commercially successful so I didn't even put em on the list. I'm hoping this post blows up and some game devs see it and recognize how much money could be made with remakes of some of these titles. Tenchu, KotOR, MGS, Silent Hill and Splinter Cell would all pretty much be guaranteed cash cows imo. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk!",James_Skyvaper,30,0,0.31

208,What's it called when a game takes you away from a usually safe place?,11s4d70,"I don't know if i'll be able to explain myself, but i'll have two examples near the end of this post to showcase what i mean.

So, by taking you away from a ""usually safe place"" i mean taking actions that you do regularly on a game and turning them into enemy encounters or something along the lines of that.

And i don't mean just jumpscares or ambushes (Like for example in The Last Of Us, you open lots of doors and sometimes opening a door triggers a staged scene or something like that, but i dont consider that as a ""safe place""), i mean things like crafting benches or save stations (also safe zones, but i cant think of any example of this), two examples are TLOU 2 and Dead Space 1, on TLOU 2, i was recently shown by a friend that if you start crafting at a certain crafting bench, you [get ambushed](https://youtu.be/i4ez9uGGRq4?t=70), and in Dead Space 1 (2008), a very similar thing happens, only that an enemy [falls behind you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOo1OtaLwA&ab_channel=Walkthrough%21Database) and its more of a jumpscare (with the music and all), so yeah, anyone know the name of this ""concept""? i just love it when they do stuff like this in games, it keeps the gameplay fresh and makes you keep an eye out the whole time, does anyone else agree with me or do you guys not really care for this kind of stuff?

PS: While looking for the Dead Space clip, i came across a [Dead Space Remake clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFhbqvxFNdA&ab_channel=Trathiel) which does something similar to both the clips i showed here but without any enemy interaction, just pure suspense, even the first comment says something along the lines of what im saying, ""... you feel so vulnerable in such a small area that you're so used to as a safe haven""",PastelLicuado,10,0,0.42

210,Game Suggestions Please,11s4bge,"Hi All,

My buddies and I got into Fortnite after work during the pandemic and we have fallen off big time regarding consistently hopping on and playing together. We have been discussing that we are all ready for a new game and want something more relaxing. Over our discussion, we have concluded that we are looking for a 4-player campaign or pve type of game that we can enjoy casually and outside of the popular BR format. We tried sea of thieves this week and unfortunately I got super seasick lmfao. 

General Specifications:

\- Ideally cross platform, we have 2 on xbox, 1 on pc, and 1 on ps5

\- PvE or Campaign style game no BR

We have tossed around titles like Destiny 2 but my hesitation is that I've heard destiny 2 is an insane grind and can feel very repetitive. Minecraft also comes to mind but that would take some convincing as the guys are all 27+ and have never tried minecraft. Honestly if a game like Dragon Age Inquisition had a 4 player cross platform campaign that would be exactly what I think we would enjoy. Heck, we would be on 2K23 or FIFA right now running a group franchise or campaign right now if they had cross-platform.

Let me know if there are any games out there that would work. Any thoughts are appreciated",plow_poon,3,0,0.4
211,Games with cool and fun utility spells,11s3j2h,"To be clear, I mean OUT of combat utility.

One of my favorite things in gaming is when you unlock a spell or ability that expedites regular mundane activities or otherwise turns them into something fun that you look forward to. Stuff like all those ""filler"" spells in DnD that create feasts and clean the kitchen after, or create a temporary house or what have you. There's a lot of cool potential in these types of spells but I VERY rarely see games dabble in this type of thing, usually reserving magic as almost entirely combat/healing based.

Some examples

1. Forespoken - Say what you will about the game, but the Burrow spell was something I didn't know I needed in my games until I got it. They took it a step further and had it reduce other cooldowns as well making it useful in combat as well as outside of it. (for those who don't know, the spell creates vines that burrow away from the PC and will automatically collect all loot within a certain radius, and it reduces the cooldown of your other support spells proportionate to the amount of loot gathered).
2. Sun Haven - Has a ton of spells that expedite the farming/mining in the game, such as a spell that mines all rocks in an area around you, creates earthquakes to till the soil and rain clouds to water crops, all VERY cool, thematic and just feel good to use.
3. Skyrim WITH mods - Not gonna list them all, but base skyrim had the spell that guides you to your objective, which was basically useless given the compass, but MODDED skyrim added a tone of cool utility spells, check out Apocalypse and Ordinator's magic supplements for some cool stuff like that.

That's about all I can think of off the top of my head, so if anyone has any other suggestions for games with a decent amount of this type of thing please let me know!",shiek200,7,0,0.47

It is an innate reaction to blood and gore that is hard to control. Other changeable reasons are some younger teenagers and those who just want more tame media.

I'm not saying that there should be no blood and gore in videogames. And there's some games where that's not feasible to change. With this new wave of accessibility settings in games, I just wish there were more games with settings to turn off blood and gore.

of course you can't deny the original games that did it still made a lot of money and other AAA studio still do them for a very simple reason, they want to make money as much as possible, with the lowest risk possible by capitalising on the bussiness model where the big money is at.

But i think even if in a surface level consumer perspective, maybe a person who did consume the first game that did the live service first, if that's the case why would i play anything else, espiecially if the business model and money come from me needing to dedicate my life to that game, why would i actually play your game when this game is basically filling my need.

And if i'm a new consumer to the genre, why would i play the obscure new one when i can just play the more popular one.

249,Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – a love letter to the infinity engine,11raiic,"As I wrap up a 300-hour journey through these two games -- one that started in November last year, but in reality started years earlier -- I find myself drawn to comparisons to Baldur’s Gate (BG1) and Baldur’s Gate II (BG2). You have two games using a well-loved system (Pathfinder 1st edition) in a real-time with pause (RTWP) engine with a not quite isometric camera. In the first you have that feeling of fresh-faced adventure and wandering a world to encounter new challenges just like BG, while the sequel has a far more focused approach which pushes you ever forward, along with a chapter where the world opens up and a ton of side-quests appear in your log, just like BG2.

These games were subject to successful Kickstarter funding campaigns, though given their production positioning them as AA games, there was clearly publisher money involved at some point. I also wonder if those campaigns aren’t the reason for some of the problems I’ll get into.

I bounced off Kingmaker (KM) a number of times, spending almost 70 hours across multiple playthroughs which never made it past act 1. Yet I kept coming back as the game offers a compelling world to explore. I'd also heard great things about Wrath of the Righteous (WoTR), particularly its mythic path system, so wanted to play that.

I’ve been playing CRPGs for decades, all the way back to Bard’s Tale. Yet it was Bioware’s Baldur’s Gate that gave me an obsession for the genre, teaching me that the kind of games I loved were shared adventures with interesting characters. I got obsessed enough with that series that I worked on the [Ascension]( https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/quests/ascension/) mod for Throne of Bhaal because I wasn’t ready to let go. Since then, CRPGs have dominated my gaming, through companies like Bioware, Obsidian, CD Projekt RED, Harebrained Schemes, and Bethesda.

Both KM and WoTR are so clearly inspired by BG series everything that came out of the Infinity Engine. While the Pillars of Eternity games were presented as nostalgia tributes to the Infinity Engine games, these feel much closer to those games, both for good and bad, and a large part of that is the Pathfinder system.

# Pathfinder

I won’t pretend to be an expert in this, but Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) had a controversial 4th edition, with concern from fans that it was a gross simplification driven by trends in the online RPG space. This led to the Pathfinder system, a fork of AD&D 3.5, which has itself had its own controversy with its 2nd edition.

Both KM and WoTR are based on the 1st edition and are great examples as to why the system is nicknamed Mathfinder.

These games reflect my first experience with the system.

# My setup

I played KM as a neutral good Ranger at Challenging difficulty, and WoTR as a neutral (dipping in and out of evil) Slayer at Core difficulty. In KM I felt Challenging should be well suited to someone with Infinity Engine experience, and also someone who had played Act 1 multiple times now. I chose Core in WoTR as that was the minimal level for numerous achievements and therefore a level where I hoped the game would punish me for lazy play, but not require the kind of hardcore optimisation of higher difficulties.

If I had to pick an example of perfect difficulty, it would be Dragon Age Inquisition at Insane difficulty. Encounters would sometimes take a couple of tries, but almost never more than two, and after every loss I could always identify the mistake **I** had made, and correct it. Anything outside the difficulty curve was optional and clearly marked, and no big spikes hit me at any time. That game had its problems, but it has the best difficulty curve I've found in a CRPG.

# Overview

Kingmaker has a strong opening act, and it’s one of the reasons I kept coming back. It introduces all the systems, and not just the combat ones, but also how skills will be used for dialogue checks, and how decisions can have consequences. Part of what was so exciting about act 1 were the various party combinations you could emerge from the tutorial with, or how the order you visit things on the world map can change how encounters play out. I went to a tomb expecting a particular encounter, only to find because I’d done things in a different order the tomb was empty and looted. It keeps things fresh, and both games keep this feeling of consequence throughout, with decisions you made coming back to influence characters and events. The conclusion of one companion quest near the end of KM had their decision partly influenced by a decision I made in the tutorial. Amazing stuff.

Both games also have cool text adventure portions. If you're familiar with such from Pillars of Eternity it's just like that, but running for longer, and occurring far more regularly. Honestly, they make much better use of it than Pillars did. I was more of a fan of the presentation in KM, especially the line art style, but text adventures were always a welcome break in both.

These are games of high highs and low lows, really the extremes are kind of incredible. At their peak you’re partaking in some epic dialogues, seeing how decisions you made earlier have shaped this scene, or perhaps even caused it to happen whereas it won’t for other players. You know that the choices you make are having a huge impact on your game to come. At their lowest moments you’re stuck manging a not so mini mini-game or bashing your head against yet another difficulty spike.

WoTR might be one of the best choice & consequence games of all time. You have multiple “mythic paths”, and each has huge chunks of content that are unique to them. While this is a systems driven game, I actually made what felt like a suboptimal choice in taking the Demon mythic path, but felt like the right narrative choice for my adventure. That choice went on to shape every relationship I had, and completely changed the tone of my game. And that’s just one of six options available to you! It’s an unbelievable level of effort, in part made possible by the minimal voice acting and much heavier reliance on text.

However, the games have a few really big problems.

# Combat

This is where the slavish adherence to Pathfinder becomes a problem. It’s a system designed for tabletop sessions, where someone can just as viably create themselves a master of non-combat elements as combat. But these games are packed full of combat encounters, and non-combat skills are just something you max out across the party without a thought. So long as someone in the party knows religion you’re good, doesn’t matter who.

The issue with combat is that you make next to no interesting decisions. 49% of combat is build, which will often involve decisions made tens of hours ago, another 49% is pre-buffing, and then only 2% is decisions in combat. The way things play out is you carefully build characters to max key stats, build synergies, and get equipment that compliments all this. That’s really cool. But then you reach a map, you run through your pre-buff routine (and later on you’ll have 40-50 effects on each character), and then you lawn mower the map. Offensive spells are next to worthless because there are too many encounters, so you derive infinitely more value from buffs. Cleanse the map, then go back and loot everything when it doesn’t matter if the buffs run out.

Buffing was so critical in WoTR that I ended up installing [a mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/195) to do it at the press of a button as I was beginning to dread enemies just for the five minute buff routine it would entail. Pre-buffing is not something I’ve missed in my CRPGs.

# Encounter design

In KM act 1 you encounter a campsite where everyone is dead, but you can rest. In this region there are warring mites and kobolds. However, they weren’t a danger to me as I had convinced both I was their ally, hence I’m safe to rest. Hah! Nope, some death skull spawns and murders you. How were you supposed to know that would happen? That’s the neat part, you don’t! And the games are packed with stuff like this where you’re steamrolling some area, then a murder monster appears and slaps you down.

Another classic is 99% of the time when you spot a monster, the game then auto-pauses so you can do what you need to do, except for the 1% of the time where it instead cutscenes you into range before you can do anything. Thanks, game!

Among KM players, just hearing about the House at the Edge of Time is enough to trigger traumatic flashbacks. I have to agree with them, that is peak Owlcat bullshit.

There are two aspects which make all this more frustrating than it needs to be.

## The combat log is shit

At the start you’ll think the combat log is good. It shows die rolls, breaks them down, you can see where most stuff comes from. Nice. Then you start to level up, and it doesn’t scale at all. By the end of WoTR you’ll be generating hundreds of lines every round, and a round is six seconds long. Good luck finding out why your archer missed in the middle of all that.

The log is in desperate need of a filter, and without one it’s an unusable nightmare. In the final battle of WoTR I couldn’t find how to counter what the boss had done, because they cast multiple area-of-effect spells in a battle with 15 combatants, generating hundreds of entries, and that’s not including the hundreds I was generating simultaneously. In that final battle I also stumbled into the discovery that I had completely underestimated the power of a certain ability because delving into the log was such a nightmare I’d never noticed before.

It’s also not very accurate. At times you will see damage being assigned to someone who already died. Sometimes checks are just missing and it’s not clear why. Other times you will see some number that has no item or feat source, leading to you tearing your hair out trying to figure out why a companion is doing more damage than you thought they would. If all you know is their name you’ll have to trawl through 40 feats, 40 buffs, and 20 items to figure out which one is doing the thing.

The mechanics are also overwhelming. I’m not sure even the designers understand how it all fits together. Even at the end of my 300 hours I was discovering ways the system works I hadn’t known. Something I didn’t notice until late for example was that each ability applied on an attack isn’t handled as part of the weapon’s attack damage, and that this then leads to certain effects being exponentially useful because while you’re ostensibly applying them to the weapon, they get applied to each effect. Then perhaps you have something which causes certain attacks to happen multiple times. So now that 2d6 bonus you applied is suddenly 10d6. Nothing in the game will tell you this, you have to stumble across it in the logs, and this is just one example!

The log simply isn’t fit for purpose.

UI in general is a problem with the games. Playing without a mod which allows you to buff at the press of a button is like indulging in self-flagellation.

## Combat is too easy to prepare you for when it isn't

If you build well and always apply your buffs you should be able to get through most combats without having to step in. Maybe you adjust targeting order, or split the archers to take out the backline while your frontline holds up the enemy. But what this means is when the game throws some nightmare encounter at you you're slamming into a wall without the education to know how to scale it. This is on the critical path.

Just as bad was when an enemy appeared that required a completely different toolset to beat than anything else present, especially frustrating when it's bosses with immunities to everything you used to get through the dungeon up until this point. Even when you are in a position to change the party, or overhaul your spell set, it felt like a tedious slog rather than a meaningful challenge. The game never gives you any indication of what threat you’ll face at any location, so you always bring the 99% effective party and spell composition. KM isn’t as bad, as most of these types of encounters exist in their own area and so you leave and come back later, but WoTR loved to do this mid-dungeon. One dungeon locks you in, and if you brought the wrong party for its challenge, you better hope you’ve got an earlier save.

This was one of my biggest sources of frustration throughout both games.

There’s also the mess of turn-based versus RTWP. In KM a well-regarded mod was put out with a turn-based setup. It’s actually a much better way to get a handle on how combat is working than RTWP allows for, but is also completely unsuitable for a game of this scale. WoTR has turn-based built-in, and this leads to the Arcanum problem of how do you balance for both? You can’t. The best example of this are swarms, where in RTWP a bunch of tics or locusts are the deadlier than any demon lord, but in turn-based are absolutely no threat whatsoever. Owlcat need to pick their poison and balance around it, you shouldn’t be seeing posts recommend switching to turn-based to beat certain encounters. I am relieved to see that their next game, Rogue Trader, will be turn-based only.

# Slavish adherence to systems which don’t belong in a computer game

The encounter design necessitates quick save since you never know when you’re going to stumble into some murder encounter. However, quick save undermines other systems. If you failed to pick a lock you need to come back when you've increased your skills. Disarming a trap comes with the danger of triggering it. Except neither of these things are true because the game has quick save.

The real issue is that there is no reward for failure. Triggering a trap doesn’t lead to some new, interesting outcome, you just take a bunch of damage that will make things harder, and harder in this game usually just means longer. There’s no incentive to let such failures stand and you will save before every trap, every chest, and reload if you fail. There needs to be a better way, either through designing for failure, or switching to a Boolean system.

My favourite example is in WoTR if you fail certain skill checks then time passes. Time passes causes all your buffs to run out. Without those buffs you’re under-powered for the area. This necessitates a rest and then re-buff. Or are you simply going to reload your save from before the skill failure? There’s no reason to accept the failure. In tabletop this means the party has to adapt and the dungeon master adjusts the scenario accordingly, but in a computer game it’s just a waste of your time.

And it's odd, because the game does have some interesting failures. For example, at one point you might choose to renounce a mythic path for another, yet some third-party tries to stop you, leading to a skill check. Pass, and you change path, fail and you stick to your original. Neither route is wrong, so failure is perfectly acceptable and leads to an outcome that is both narratively and mechanically interesting. I want more of that, please.

# Dreadful not so mini games

Both games feature ill-advised strategic games that sit above the CRPG layer. Both serve as undesired interruptions to the cool CRPG you’re playing. KM’s is heavily reliant on die rolls you have little control over and almost necessitates quick load to avoid getting randomly screwed with failure leading to a spiral of doom as failure begets failure. WoTR’s is just a tedious chore and is what if Heroes of Might & Magic 3 (HOMM3) but shit, and I didn’t much like HOMM3 in the first place. Honestly, WoTR feels like it has the overland travel simply because KM did, despite the fact that there's very little to discover out there.

Both have the same issue where nothing on the strategic level really impacts the CRPG aspect, so it’s hard to care about any of it. The only times either work is when you get the more traditional throne room scene where you make key decisions via dialogue. These allow for cool character expression, both by yourself and your companions. It feels more like running a kingdom/crusade than anything that happens on the strategic map.

Had they been limited to assigning advisors and throne room scenes then they’d have been good, and indeed the way different advisors in KM can play out is cool, but generally these modes are just a massive time sink that represent a good 15% of your play time. You can’t ignore them either because you can lose the game in this mode, and at least in KM certain powerful items are tied to quest lines which are tied to this.

# A problem with endings

Sadly, both games share a problem, and that’s the ending. In recent years CRPGs have begun to understand the importance of the denouement, and CD Projekt RED is a prime example of this with both Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 having deeply satisfying send offs. Meanwhile, WoTR has one of the least satisfying and most jarring endings I’ve ever encountered, where the final boss fight concludes then you’re immediately dumped into some very short slides and the game ends.

Owlcat need to trim some of the fat from their games and scale back their plans. Both KM and WoTR are clearly running out of steam towards the end. In KM the maps you unlock near the end have far less locations to explore, while in WoTR the reactivity starts to fall apart with key events not being commented on by individuals who absolutely would have something to say. You can even sacrifice your life and your love interest won’t have a word to say about it.

For all the replayability of WoTR, I went from “can’t wait to experience this journey again” to “meh” because the destination is just that unsatisfying. Slides are a poor way of presenting an ending at the best of times, and this is one of the worst uses of them I’ve seen to date. It’s not only that it’s jarring, it’s that the slides are so slight. While it’s not Mass Effect 3 bad, it did leave me with a sort of empty feeling, and not in the good way an epic EPG can. WoTR is actually a step back from KM in this regard, which had more detail and reactivity in its slides, though both really need an epilogue piece.

Both games have secret endings, and while I don't know much about the WoTR one, I went into KM prepared. I did every quest, I completed every kingdom research item. The one time I could just feel I'd picked a bad dialogue option with the antagonist that was taking me off the path, I reloaded. Then, right at the end, I found I couldn't get the secret ending because 50 hours earlier a secret die roll had happened without me knowing and I'd failed a check. This is the Owlcat design philosophy in a nutshell, and makes me wonder why they combine this with such long games.

# Despite it all I love these games

It’s the unabashed ambition most of all. KM gives you that feeling of BG1 where you’re exploring the land, stumbling upon cool encounters. WoTR has some of the best choice & consequence stuff I’ve ever seen in a CRPG, and begs for you to replay it.

I love the mechanical stuff. It’s intimidating as hell, and I almost always stuck to single class, but figuring out how to try and optimise your build, put together cool synergies, and then see it tear through enemies, never gets old. Even as I came to the end of each game I was thinking how I’d do things differently next time.

My primary love for CRPGs though isn’t systems based, it’s narrative. I want a world packed with people I care about. It’s why I was along for the ride when Bioware started to trim the fat in the Mass Effect games, and why CD Projekt RED is my current favourite RPG company.

KM, despite being touted as a narrative CRPG is actually lighter than you might expect. The comparison to BG1 & BG2 earlier wasn’t an accident. It’s not BG1 light, but you can see in WoTR that Owlcat have gained more confidence and experience in putting this stuff together. The companions are more interesting, do more to defy expectations in their arcs, and the romance choices are far more interesting. I could do without my 160 hour CRPG allowing me to tank a romance through one bad dialogue choice, but Bioware didn’t master this overnight either. And the romances are a breath of fresh air if you found Bioware stuff fairly milquetoast.

I can't give Owlcat enough credit for their writing of evil characters. They're not treated as one-note, or cackling idiots, rather they have their own world views which are treated as seriously as anything else. A favourite of mine in WoTR is Regill, your Hellknight companion who embodies the philosophy of victory through discipline, and as he tells one character, ""The forces of good are not weak, it's just you."" He's labelled as lawful evil because of his philosophy, but he sees himself one of the good guys. And the game is packed with characters like this. And this equally applies to being evil yourself, where you can pursue paths of lust, or power, or ambition, or ""the greater good"", rather than just being a dick. I haven't had this much fun playing evil since Dragon Age Origins, and the warden who had yet to meet the demon he wouldn't do a deal with.

What I also loved is how much variability I had in party composition, especially in KM. Generally in a CRPG I lock in my party and it never changes, but here I had real options, and the game provided me with the equipment necessary to keep everyone viable. In KM I left one companion at a ford for a long time because I couldn’t be bothered to change up my party, yet by the end of the game they’d become a key part of my personal story and I felt a close, personal connection to them.

WoTR hits some incredible highs. When you’re standing before demon lords and gods and making choices that you know will shape the entire story to come, well that’s just CRPG heroin to me. The game hits these sorts of highs over and over and over again. So many epic moments, and I only wish it didn’t end in such a wet fart.

I know I dwelled far more on bad than the good, but ultimately if you enjoyed Infinity Engine games then you’re getting into something that is a natural evolution, while also keeping many of the flaws those games had too.

There has been much discussion over the years about wasted content, time spent making things a player will never see, and companies trying to avoid this. I'm glad Owlcat don't, because content I will never see is what allows me to have experienced *my* story rather than *the* story, and it makes the game mean so much more to me. The mistakes Owlcat make are also a reason for their strengths, because they haven't soaked in the prevailing wisdom of what you should and should not do, so why not make six completely different paths of the player? I'm glad of it, that someone out there is making this kind of game still.

I find myself with the realisation that Owlcat is the company Beamdog so desperately wanted to be.

# So which should you play?

WoTR is the better game, no two ways about it. The companions are better developed, and the writers are good at defying expectations in how an arc should play out. The mythic path system really lets you shape your own story, and critically it’s a much tighter story than KM’s episodic feel.

Yet I’d say KM is the better first game. WoTR has a more fleshed out tutorial, but it really doesn’t convey the stuff you need to know, and in the in-game encyclopaedia in both games are utter garbage, you will need to use Google. The enemies in WoTR require a better understanding of the systems, with all sorts of immunities and resistances among them. KM has more traditional CRPG monsters that act as you expect, and in one of the lone instances of resistances being important it dedicates multiple encounters and scenes to educating you on this. KM won’t Pathfinder you quite as hard as WoTR will, and WoTR also has a more brutal difficulty curve.

If you’re big on your CRPGs though, you should find time for both. Owlcat is a name that’s on the rise, and I will be buying anything they put out, or I will twelve months after they put it out. These are also very buggy games, even playing it more than a year after launch I didn’t get through a single WoTR session where I didn’t file a bug report. Maybe give it another year in the oven.

Impressions generally seem to have the following common points-

\-Lots of weapon variety and customization.  
\-Combat feels good and is fun, but not the best first-person melee ever.  
\-FLESH system is the game's biggest innovation.  
\-Fighting basic zombies can get repetitive & encounter design isn't always great.  
\-World is small and surprisingly linear (even compared to the first game), but pretty to look at.  
\-Characters may have custom elements to their stories.  
\-Feels like a game from the 360/PS3 era in terms of design, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

Should be interesting to see how this game shakes out, especially compared to Dying Light 2, which was received less warmly by the community than the first overall. The game looks fun, but I'm most worried about the idea that each playable area is, as one preview put it, ""basically a linear corridor with some side paths,"" which sounds like a step down from even Dead Island 1's limited worldspaces.",GameShrink,39,11,0.66

You have to make one of every weapon and that requires grinding for money and materials which means running through the same dungeons over and over until the RNG gods bless you with the item you want 

This can take hours just to get enough items to craft a single piece of equipment and if that wasn’t enough you need to get seals and use them all which means you could have to grind to make the same piece of equipment dozens of times just hoping the next time you’ll get the seal 

This is just one example there are numerous games out there that require insane grinds like this to 100% them and I wonder who is it for? Would people complain if grinds like this weren’t in games?

Why can't game studios get past their angsty phase, and make games that are a little brighter, and have fun in the writing and presentation of the game? Like you can have serious elements to your  game without everything being super dark, and you can have combat without making every NPC sound like some psychopathic killer.

It  even goes down to art style and music: There isn't any ""fun"" music in most games, it's just super serious cinematic orchestra, and there isn't any kinda cartoony art, it's all gotta be ""realism"" and look/run like shit.

Why are game devs, and especially MMO devs, so edgy? It seems like the only games that weren't grimdark are from 30 years ago, with the VERY OCCASIONAL game like Hifi Rush that isn't extra edge at all times -- as far as MMOs go, the only ones I can think of that weren't edgy were Wildstar and Maplestory / Maplestory 2.

314,In defense of Preston Garvey [discussion],11pufp9,"Ok ok I know! Preston sucks! Everyone here agrees Preston Garvey sucks.

But let’s take a step back and see it from his shoes alright?

First he’s got a platoon he’s running with. A group called the minutemen. Military wannabes who just want to help the people however they can.

However little by little they’re outnumbered and picked off until Preston’s just left with:

- an old drug loving seer 

-two regular civilians who don’t really know anything about combat

- a mechanic

- and someone who lost their brother and also doesn’t know combat

So in this case Preston’s the only be who knows anything about combat. And then the player shows up and saves him and his group from a raider attack they had no way of getting out of on their own

Afterwards the player leads the group to a nice place to be safe.

And what does Garvey do? He doesn’t give up on what he believes in. He sticks to the minutemen by letting this new person who just saved them go out and help others in the wastelands while he sticks around and protects the friends he’s made. Why?

Well if you were him, what would you do?

-go out on your own with limited supplies and possibly get killed

Or

-send a new friend who’s a combat veteran off to help other people who are in need of it. (…. Nate’s the veteran. Nora’s just a tough cookie)

I know what I’d choose. I’d be like Garvey and stick close to my friends.

That is until that certain new general turns traitor and joins raiders! THAT EARNS A LASER TO THE FACE, SON!

317,Any good realistic gardening video games?,11ptaky,"This is admittedly probably a bit fluffy for here, I have no shame about it! I'm really curious what are some equally really fun and realistic gardening video games-- the bf has a ps4, ps5, switch, and DS and we have a shared PC (mine basically became ours when he moved in, though he doesn't use it much, he's shy), so I'm down for suggestions across multiple formats/devices/whatever!",ichillonforums,27,7,0.69
318,Can someone help me identify a PS2 game?,11ps9oi,"I'm trying to find a game for a friend, but neither of us remembers the name. 

It was an English 3rd person RPG game with a graphical ambiance similar to Bloodborne. (Dark ruined cities)

Your character could summon minions similar to Pikmin, and the summons you selected would give your character different abilities. 

You could level up your character and the minions independently for stat and ability boosts. 

I can't remember if there were multiple main characters, but one he played as was male. 

One of the minions could be used as ""bombs.""

Levels could be played multiple times, and you received a score based on performance in the linear environments. 

The game was payable before 2007.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 🙏",ambermage,18,7,0.69

320,Sad story,11pn8ax,When I moved from home back in 92 I had put a bunch of stuff in my moms attic.    I completely forgot about until a few years ago.    The box contained an Atari 2600 and a huge box of games….including a copy of the dreaded E.T. game.  Unfortunately my parents have both passed on.    As far as I know the box is still in the attic of a small house in east Texas.,Recycled_Human_Flesh,10,2,0.54

322,What was the first game to get a remake/ remaster ?,11pkdk8,"First one that comes to mind is Super Mario All Stars, which had SMB, SMB Lost Levels, SMB2 and SMB3 from the NES remade in 16-bits graphics.",stronkzer,8,0,0.4
323,Hot take but I disagree with the notion that games are about the gameplay,11pkbfh,"Video games are a medium that combines sound, narrative, visuals, cinematography and interactivity all in one, and the merit of any game is not solely defined by its gameplay.  

Sometimes when reviewing a game I will feel a game’s focus is not particularly about the gameplay, and then people will disagree and say games should be primarily about the gameplay and be confused about how I scored a game. RPGs are often a good example. Sometimes the gameplay is poor when taken alone, but the gameplay serves more as a means to provide a backdrop to the world, characters, story, and emotions it evokes that stick with you for years.  

Obviously a competitive multiplayer game will focus on the gameplay, but that just shows the variety of experiences videogames can provide. 

Games should be judged as a whole and how all the parts of it come together to form a unique experience.",Frost_Butt,87,0,0.27

325,Is The Witcher 3 overrated?,11pjtos,"I have always heard The Witcher 3 was one of the greatest games ever made and was constantly propped up as the holy grail of modern games. Something you HAD to play. I finally tried it for the first time a few years ago and was surprisingly disappointed. Not saying it’s a bad game, just compared to the praise it gets, it’s… ok? It felt very dated. I thought I was just an outlier until recently I’ve seen more and more people come out and say they weren’t very impressed with it either.

Stuff we have already is Dead by Daylight which is alright but gets a bit boring after a while.

RPG or Dungeon crawler like games would be awesome too

328,"Please, for the sake of god, help me find a game!",11phkky,"Hey guys, months ago I was at a really bad mood and kind of depressed. So I tried Pillars of Eternity 1 and immediately fell in love. Such a great game and great story, that I've managed to play it 3 times in a row! But I've been just sitting on my computer for the past week looking for a game to play without sucess. I would love some help.  


So I've been playing games like this, and heres what I played so far:  


**ISOMETRIC**

\- Pillars of Eternity  
\- Pillars of Eternity 2  
\- Tyranny

\- Divinity: Original Sin 2  
\- Pathfinder: WoR  
\- Torment: Tides of Numenera

**3D**

\- The Outer Worlds

\- Fallout (3, Vegas, 4)

\- State of Decay

&#x200B;

**I DIDN'T LIKE:**  


\- Encased (cool game overall but too simple of a combat and lore)

&#x200B;

If anyone are looking for great RPG games to play, I recommend all of the above. Recently, I've been looking for a game like these ones. Here is the tags that I like:  


\- RPG *(the only must be)*  
\- Isometric *(not mandatory, just preferred)*  
\- Great character development and world history.

\- If it has ""make your choice"" *(your answer changes the end of the game)* you can be sure that i'll fall in love instantly.

\- Base management is also really cool.",Morpegom,33,0,0.48
