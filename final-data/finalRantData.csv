0,Its bullshit that my parent's income dictates my FAFSA eligiblity,11voa1t,"I'm 22, have been on my own for four years, and have never had and never will have my parent's support. I have my bachelor's and I worked and took out loans all by myself. They didn't even do so much as buy me a pencil or notebook. Now I want to pursue a new degree and I can't get shit for grants even though I'm poor as hell on my own.

2,TikTok should go burn in the depths of Hell where it belongs.,11vr5tl,"There is literally no other application or property in existence that makes me more angry than TikTok. It is simply an app where people with no talent, purpose or intelligence go and get famous by doing every-day tasks that could be done anywhere in the world, all the while people with genuine talent, creativity and smarts are stuck in subways, pubs and street performances. Add a bit of spyware by the Chinese government and that's the spice.

The autism challenge, the devious lick challenge, the Nyquil chicken challenge, all trends that stem from a fucking cascade of degeneracy and immaturity. It's a fucking disgrace. Whenever I tell people of my hatred for the platform, I'm frowned upon and called weird which is pretty bloody telling in itself. Instead of fucking frowning in the mirror crying salty-ass tears into your Gucci mug over your side view with 4G internet, heating and electricity acting like you're oppressed in a first world country, get off your fucking ass and do something with your life. Instead of investing thousands of dollars, pounds, etc. on makeup products, surgery and nosejobs, invest that money into your business, your family, your accommodation and see just how much more of a worthwhile purchase it is.

3,I fucking hate group works.,11vqz2s,"I had a group work in math the other day. The kind that you work with someone, then the times up, then you move on to the other person. 

I didn‚Äôt wanna work with certain ppl, because I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable knowing they were literal bitches. But guess what? I had to. 

I couldn‚Äôt tell my teacher bc she didn‚Äôt tell us this was happening till the day it was happening. So I was basically shaking the whole time. 

The worse thing is, I had to talk to them. I didn‚Äôt wanna talk to them, or even make eye contact.

5,It's hard for me to make new friends,11vkbsc,"I've just been to a convention recently by myself, and I didn't have the best time.

I've heard that conventions are a good place for people to make new friends, but I felt as though people weren't interested in talking to me. The majority of people were already there with their friends, and while I did get to talk to some cosplayers and take pictures with them, it just felt as though they didn't reciprocate my interest in conversation.

6,lets admit that the high prices is more from greed and not from inflation,11um5z4,"I have to call complete bs on the high prices. some things are in short supply but there is definite price gauging and greed happening. and many werent affected with their supply pirce increasing. many just got on the bandwagon as a free ride and use the bs excuse of ""everything increased"" -aszholes.

7,Retirement is a scam,11vte4r,"I put money into my 401k to handle the expenses that must be paid for when I die. I am not wealthy; my family is not rich, I didn't grow up with money, and my parents are basically old and broke. Whatever romanticized version of the future they try and push onto you about enjoying retirement like you accomplished something is bs. Financial security is a real thing, and a large retirement savings account can be thought of as a tax dis-advantaged savings account for emergencies. Disadvantage because of a 10% penalty for early withdrawal. Your happiest years had better be between the ages of 10 and 60 because that is your life, not after retirement. The constant reinforcement of planning for retirement, and oh no what am I going to do about retirement, who cares? Die. That's what retirement is for, it's time for you to die. It's not time for you to start a new chapter of life crossing things off your bucket list that you have always wanted to do. By all means, cross things off your bucket list, but do them because you want to do them, not because you have some obligation to get them done before you are dead. Great, you've spent your entire life planning for retirement, good for you, now you can be old and comfortable and not have to worry about money until you get cancer and every penny of your lifelong accrual gets handed over to a medical conglomerate so while you thought you were saving for retirement you were actually saving so you could make a hospital CEO .00000000001 percent richer.

11,people need stop bring ther ESA to non pet friendly location,11vll9k,EDA (emotional support animals) are a great to for who need them & I think bring them with where appropriate pet friendly places is great & all good but not to pet friendly location. An ESA is not a SD (service dog) & does not have the legal right to enter a non pet friendly location like a SD. An ESA does nothing to help you in a store & can cause more probems for SD teams. For the love of all thing stop bring pets & ESAs to the places that are not allowed especially if they like to meet other animals & people at the store as that causes distraction.

It's never been an feeling I have been able to shake even with having all these years pass. It's honestly made worse when I've had my god auntie always tell me I am worthless for choosing to go take care of my mental health first above all else. Like, am I genuinely a piece of shit, scumbag, lazy, waste of a life because I have the self awareness with myself knowing I won't be able to tackle certain stuff at least not without seeing mental health treatment?

I really don't know anymore. Like, collage isn't something completely off the bat; I just need YEARS of mental health treatment for surviving the stuff I've been through with my family and I ESPECIALLY need it after my family basically only wants to talk with me whenever they want something from me. Like I just don't know anymore. So should I just kill myself for wanting to look after my mental health?

I saw someone doing something on there and it was sick. The guy literally must be mentally i‚Äôll. i‚Äôm not gonna fully get into it because it might be really uncomfortable with some people. it was certainly very uncomfortable for me, I spent the whole night thinking abt it and it gave me stress. 

TIP! Don‚Äôt go on omegle :)

What happened was‚Ä¶ all i‚Äôll say is I saw a grown man doing unforgivable stuff to his child. What a disgusting thing to go on omegle for. 
Please dont hate on this post I just needed to rant. And if the post gets taken down, I understand. This wasn‚Äôt the best thing to post. 

Again if u dont wanna say sum nice or understanding just pls dont comment. and if u said that this was an uncomfortable post, welp, not my fault u read it I gave a lotta warnings.

You treat my property that I paid for with my hard earned money like garbage?  I hope you lose everything and become homeless and have to watch other people have things to enjoy.

It was my 3rd ride of the new spring.  I put thousands of dollars and many of my own hours into that bike two winters ago.  Not only was my bike hauled away on a trailer to be processed by the insurer, but I was left stranded in the next town and ended up paying a stranger to drive me home after his shift ended at 10pm.

Maybe the damage is superficial.  Maybe you damaged the rear axle, chain tensioner or even the gear box.  You really fucked up the hard luggage that is now jammed and cocked half out of the mounting rail.  And you left it precariously balanced on the side stand which was a hair trigger away from folding back in and collapsing the bike on anyone unlucky enough to touch it.

An honest person would have gone inside the establishment and looked for someone in riding gear.  An honest person would have put their own name and a real phone number with the messy message scrawled on the back of someone else's business card, so I wouldn't have called some poor random tax accountant demanding to know why they hit my bike and didn't come find me.

But you are not an honest person.  You probably were driving without insurance, or you took daddy's car without asking and didn't want to get in trouble.  Did you tell him you dropped something on it in the garage?

Do you sleep well at night knowing that the world hates people like you?  People who dont take responsibility for their actions?  There were lots of small children around that establishment today, at least 3 separate birthday parties.

Kids were admiring my bike.  Can you sleep well tonight knowing how easy it would have been for it to fall over on one of them, crushing them?  Can you sleep easy knowing even though the evidence shows it wouldn't  have been my fault that I would still have had nightmares about the poor kid?

Do you think life is all about you, and as long as you can get away with it nothing else matters?  Well, one day you won't get away with it, and the consequences will change your life for the worse.  Hopefully just your life, but maybe someone else's too.  Can you look someone in the eye after your carelessness, selfishness and disregard for others took their loved one from them?

How do you live with yourself when you knowingly write a fake number on a note?  How do you look in your dishonest eyes in the mirror and not hate what you see?  Hate who you are?   How does the world not see in your eyes the fraud you are?  Oh, they know.  Anyone who is a worthy human being can see you for who you really are and will turn and walk away from you.  The only people who are willing to be near you are the frauds and liars like you.

And you tell each other the world hates you so fuck em.  Well, the feeling is mutual but you deserve it, not us.  We who live honest lives will move on.  Yes, it stings to be treated like you did, but we have happy lives to return to because despite what others do to us we live honest lives.  Because our honesty and integrity bring us love and support and community that is far richer than your miserable lives.

You may interfere with us from time to time, but you will stay out where you belong, with the dogs and the rats.

38,"My friend's sister said to leave, so he did",11vfwn2,"So me and my best friend has known each other for almost a decade. He was living with his step dad that adopted him around 1, and the place he was living in was a trailer except with extensions to make it bigger. One of the rooms right next to his has black mold over half the wall, no central air or nothing. He was working where ever the man's daughters were working, he wanted to work at a warehouse to make more money but their dad said ""no because I want to pick up everyone at one time"" he would also take away money my friend's money, and charge him whatever he got payed so he couldn't save up money to leave. My friend didn't have a driver's license or even a permit, when my friend asked his step dad about it he would say next week, or even next month however never did it. My friend also gotten taken advantage of, his step dad would tap into his bank account and steal money from my friend taxes to pay for the step dads property taxes. Eventually a couple years ago by and his step dads dementia was getting worse he had forgotten that my friend existed and was helping out with bills. So my friend ended getting a gun shoved into his face telling him to leave, after getting him to realize who he was he calmed down. My friend was also the only one working for cash to support 3 people other than himself on a fast food restaurant pay. After a while his step dad has a stroke goes to the hospital and leaves the hospital, after 5 days the search team finds him dead in the woods. My friend then was taking care of 2 of his step sister's that lived with him, and giving gas money to the 1 step sister who had kids and was hopping guys for some cash net. The 1 step sister was unique in quite some bad ways, she got my buddy his permit and I fixed the step sister's van in agreement that she would teach him how to drive which never happened except for 1 time. After the funeral for the step dad the 1 step sister told the 2 step sister to pay for everyone's lunch and dinner for the funeral guests. She did, paying about 300$ for Golden Carrol and food for dinner. Then the 1 step sister also put a GoFundMe for her dad's funeral, my friend's girlfriend put in 100$, the 1 step sister then took all the money for the funeral and spent it in 2 days on a so called ""vacation"". So naturally me, my mom, my friend, and his girl was very pissed off. Then a couple weeks go by and my friend is still supporting them, me, my mom, and his girl start telling my friend that it's not his responsibility to take care of them. After all the 2 step sister is 28 and my friend is 24. None of the step sister's wanted to get a job because ""jobs piss them off"". My friend then ended staying with the 1 step sister for 2 weeks taking 1 shower a week, she told him he had to pay their water bill which was 150$ for taking 2 showers. Then 2 weeks after that she then used part of the GoFundMe to buy and above ground pool for 500$ and then filled it up at the house my friend was staying at which costed 500$. 1 step sister told him ""he couldn't go In it"", in which I replied when hearing that, ""screw that you paid for the water we're both going in"". She then wouldn't pay him anything, after a while, the 1 step sister would then peer pressure the 3 step sister to be on her side or get abandoned. After a while all the step sister's was getting angry at my friend and even threatened to break his stuff on numerous occasions. Lifting my friend Xbox up and dropping it a few feet, I tried to go over there whenever I could to help him stay calm. He eventually was told he wasn't part of the family and to get out, so he did. He moved out with his girlfriend and I helped out. I seen how he was treated throughout half his life and I'm glad he got away from that crazy place. He is doing much better and yes I left out some details to make sure no one could know who this is coming from. I don't need his so called family coming to me and causing problems, also step sister 1 and 2 have no wifi now because they couldn't afford the payment due to being lazy and the sheer will to not work.",Entitled_Buns69,0,2,1.0

My dad specifically was very angry that i got a job (even though i literally had nothing to do all summer)- he told me that i needed to quit as soon as possible. When i quit i noticed that $900 of the money i worked for was gone from my bank account, i asked my parents where it went he told me he used it to start my ‚Äúinvestment account‚Äù. When i asked to see the account he refused to show me.

i think its social conditioning at an early age, when at that time my mother would get angry and threw a tv remote everytime i cant answer her questions. theres always something to throw, and at that time my father cant do anything about it. since then i ended up always wanting to fllfill others expectations on me, i fear their judgement just like my mother did to me when i was a child.

they seemingly changed now, as if the people i've hated when i was child doesn't exist anymore, that's unfair, but i cant just keep being angry and making things worse, i have to move on.

And if all characters keep coming back, it makes their death less meaningful. Every time I watch a character die on TV, I think to myself ‚Äúthey‚Äôre probably going to come back‚Äù.

54,Tired of people arguing about certain shows being anime.,11va601,"I am tired of people arguing whether shows like ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" or ""Castlevania"" are anime. Here's definition for you.

If you are in Japan:

'Anime' is Japanese for 'animation'. Which means that everything animated is anime. ""Catlevania"", ""Powerpuff Girls"", ""Frozen"", everything

If you are in the West:

'Anime' is a term for animation made specifically in Japan. Western shows can be anime-influenced (like ""Avatar"" or the majority of modern shows like ""She-Ra"" or ""Amphibia""), but they can not be called anime.

So, if you live in the West (I assume majority of you are), or anywhere else outside East Asia, American shows can not be anime by definition. It is time to stop stigmatizing the word 'cartoon'. People are ashamed they love a 'cartoon', so they say 'anime' instead'. There are so many lovely Western cartoons these days, both for adult and family-friendly. This stigma must go away.

'Cartoon' isn't just ""Baby Boss"" or ""Family Guy"". Cartoon is also ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"", ""Gravity Falls"", ""Infinity Train"", ""Arcane"", ""Invincible"", ""She-Ra and the Princesses of Power"", ""Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse"", ""The Owl House"", etc.",First_Mechanic9140,0,1,0.66

Over fucking thinking ruins reviewing/rating movies for me because 

If I don't do that, the scores make no sense in relation to each other.

It's the same with books. I've recently read Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion. Separately those books are 8s, but together there are easy 9s. However, I think that those books are inseparable, so should I give each of them a 9 or 8?

If a piece of art made an emotional impact on me during reading but after recency bias come off and I noticed some serious flaws, should I go back and change the score I gave it?

Fuck this.

This system is messed up and what should (at the very least) happen imo is... Get rid of the numbers and make the review either positive, negative or mixed with a bigger emphasis on the text aspect.

85,Most recruiters are fucking annoying and don't add anything to the recruitment process. Third-party recruitment agencies are (most of the time) leeches that have absolutely incompetent staff.,11tlp08,"So I am an IT expert in a perspective field, so I get recruitment calls pretty often and am just tired of incompetent recruiters. Most of them are young ladies who know ABSOLUTELY nothing about IT or even the position they offer.  They are usually just trying to play psychological games with you. Trying to create feelings of exclusivity, dissatisfaction and desirability. Most of the calls and DMs/emails go like this:

""R: Hello, I am xxx from xxx recruitment and we are looking for an xxx developer for an xxx corporation. Are you looking for a change?

Me: Maybe? What are you offering?

R: Work on contract for xxx. Do you have experience with xxx and xxx (Usually very broad questions while all of the info is available in great detail on my LinkedIn and this questioning usually takes several minutes)? What is your salary expectation?""

Me: What technologies are you working with, what projects do you have, what is the size of the team, what benefits are you offering and what does the job consist of?

R: Well for that I'd have to arrange an interview with the hiring manager. If you are interested I have to know your salary expectation.""

So... You can tell me nothing about the job. You can't even tell me your salary range or benefits and expect ME to tell you my price for a job you TOLD ME NOTHING ABOUT? Hell, I don't even know if I want to waste my time on this job offer and conduct an interview...

That is if they even call about the right technologies (which are again in great detail on my LinkedIn where you found me in the first place) and offer absolutely unfitting positions (managerial, high senior, or absolutely different technologies). Sometimes they don't even write the CORRECT NAME in the bulk messages they are sending.

The worst part is, that they usually ask the corporation for a commission on each of your salaries for the whole duration of the employment(so the recruitment company pays you 100 000 but gets 110 000 from the employer) while they added ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the process.

Often the workers don't even cooperate in the same company so they call you multiple times for the same opportunity and some of the agencies even work in an MLM-like fashion.

I get multiple calls like these a week and it is just so tiring. I don't want to turn down the opportunity because it can genuinely be a good opportunity but the calls are so tedious and I'd appreciate not wasting my time on interviews when most of the opportunity filtering can be done on a call with the recruiter if they were even a little bit professional and informed. This way I just feel like a piece of meat being traded on a meat market.

It is a rarity to find a good recruiter (who usually works directly for the company) who can tell me about the position, benefits and the company) and I am just so much more open to listening to what they have to offer.

Companies. PLEASE get your own qualified recruiters. A recruiter is the first contact of a candidate with your company and if you try to hire me through an incompetent 3rd party recruiter, it just tells me that you potentially don't give a shit about your employees (which doesn't always have to be true) and are just looking for a piece of meat.

86,I hate my body,11uiv4m,"

I don‚Äôt like how it looks. I look like a mom of 10 kids because I keep losing and gaining weight. People will see my body and think I‚Äôve had kids even though I never have. My stomach has loose skin, fat pouches (permanent standing rolls) under my boobs, and I have a big fupa/lower belly pouch that‚Äôs big. Sometimes it even looks like I‚Äôm pregnant. I have muscular damage due to sucking in my stomach because I hate my stomach, and I‚Äôll likely need physical therapy or surgery because I can‚Äôt breathe correctly and my stomach tenses up. 

My only perks are my face and my chest. I‚Äôm a bra size 38 dd which is pretty big.I‚Äôd give up my big boobs for a smaller frame and curvy body and defined waist. 

There‚Äôs loose skin and pouches of fat on my back and it completely hides my waist. My back fat makes me look like I have no waist and its standing rolls. My butt stays the same no matter how much weight I gain. I have stretch marks on basically every body part (arms, back, stomach, boobs, thighs, calves) and there‚Äôs over 2,500 stretch marks. I‚Äôm trying to lose weight right now, I feel like that will help. 

I‚Äôve always stuck out around girls my own age. I‚Äôve never had a flat stomach. I have an eating disorder and this won‚Äôt go away unless I get plastic surgery. Y‚Äôall do NOT know how good you have it. I guarantee you if you feel fat rn, you‚Äôre going to look back on how you look rn as seeing yourself thin .

87,"We were in a GOLDEN AGE of art, but AI is slowly ending it.",11unf6c,"
The whole appeal of art, at least in part,  is appreciating the skill of the craft. It was hand made, every artist had their own little touch that made it theirs. You appreciated the time and effort it would take to make. Then the visual appeal. Its like eye candy. Its what made the internet a EUTOPIA for art. For browsing, creating, sharing, critisizing, and appreciating art.

The internet did this for millions of people, millions of times a day. Things like the rennaissance couldnt even compare to this age of history. We had an amazing technology that fueled one of mankinds oldest passions. Thousands of years lead to that one moment someone first shared their art online in the 90s. 

And now its all over. With the rise of AI images, if I see a perfectly drawn imagine online with a specific criteria of style, my first instinct isnt ""Holy crap this is a talented artist"", its ""Is this AI generated?"" For a short while it was easy to tell if it was AI or not due to the hands and other distinct features,  but newer stuff looks indestinguishable from actual art. I imagine withing a year itll be even harder to tell. I cant even imagine 5-10 years. People are definitely going to lie and say its handmade when its completely AI. When that happens, art as we know it will be extinct.

And now for the unhinged rant. This fucking pisses me off. These days it seems like art is, or WAS-the one pure and positive thing ANYONE could partake in and enjoy, but now theyve turned it into mass produced SLOP. From a societal view, ai has chewed art up, spit it out, and said ""Stop enjoying things, get back to work.""

For some prompters, theyre just doing it to spite artists. Either out of jealousy, or theyre trying to get back at us for shooting down their dumb NFT investment schemes. For others they genuinely convinced themselves that THEYRE the ones creating the images and not a computer. Theyre SO DESPERATE for instant validation due to a steady diet of social media, that theyd GLADLY fuck over the entire art space and everyone in it, if it means they can get that small bit of dopamine.

99,Dating apps profit by making you feel bad about yourself,11tqe14,"Popular dating apps like Tinder and Bumble are manufactured with the specific intention of making you feel poorly about yourself to elicit premium subscription purchase. 

I admittedly suffer from very poor self esteem as a result of trauma. I have made the (bad) decision of paying for a Tinder subscription on multiple occasions and I‚Äôve realized a very scummy pattern on their end. 

On occasions where I have not payed for premium, I‚Äôm usually met with a stockpile of near 40 hidden likes (fairy isolated town of 100,000 people, idk how these numbers compare to big cities), after only a week. 

Most recently, I decided to make a new Tinder account and pay for premium as soon as the profile was created. My, apparently delusioned, thinking was that if there‚Äôs this many people swiping right on me, I might as well just pay so I can see them as they like my profile. 

After paying the outrageously and embarrassingly high price of premium, my profile (almost identical to previous), received only a single like in the entire week following. 

This leads me to believe, with near certainty, that Tinder intentionally withholds showing one‚Äôs profile to manifest these feelings of inadequacy and increase the odds of one paying for their service in an act of self-preserving desperation. 

Immoral business practice? Certainly. Surprising? Not in the slightest lmao. It‚Äôs the same kinda shit all social media platforms do; create a poor self-esteem based dopamine dependency.

117,Work is draining me,11tquny,"I‚Äôve raised the same concern with my Manager twice now; once at the end of last year and yesterday morning and absolutely nothing has changed.

I think my workplace is genuinely affecting my mental and physical health. Every morning when I come into work I have hot flashes, like I get really overheated for about 5 minutes and cool down after, which hasn‚Äôt been a problem until these last few months. 

I work in a very small team, there are two of us who do the bulk of the work, my manager and a new person who started about a month ago. We do a completely different job to the rest of the staff and take care of them ie. do all the admin work, daily cleaning, design and help get important documents out by their deadline date for about 100+ staff across the country. 

Previously I was getting burnt out as we didn‚Äôt have that second person. I was falling asleep as early as 7pm and had no time for taking care of myself after work. This has gotten a little better that we hired the second person halfway through last year but not by much. This person doesn‚Äôt double check their work before sending it out, for example there were a ton of spelling mistakes in a document that was to be presented to our board of Directors, forgets to order stuff for the office so I need to constantly remind them and doesn‚Äôt manage their time. Recently, a deadline was almost not going to be met so in order to meet it, this person needed myself and two others to help with tasks, as well as another two people staying until midnight to get this document out on time. On top of this, so many other small mistakes are still being made almost a year into the job.

I voiced my concerns to my manager yesterday and was met with nothing back. No, I‚Äôll have a chat with them. Instead I was told to focus on myself, don‚Äôt let someone elses work pace affect mine, try to get rid of this negativity I‚Äôve been holding and that because I was a freelancer maybe its hard for me to work in a team.

126,Break Up,11ttqej,"I just want to let out my frustrations. Responses are not needed, but if you want to comment please feel free.

Last night at 3am my long-term girlfriend and I broke up. It was a tumultuous relationship with many ups and downs. The downs never being so low and the ups never being so high. 

My ex and I started dating when I was a junior in college. She was a working foreigner as an au-pair and we met online. I was head over heels for her. She is an amazing person who has a heart of gold for other people. There are a lot of great things about her. Overall, she is a strong, passionate, kind and intelligent person. I really wanted her to be the one, i really tried hard.

Every weekend, I would drive 3 hours to visit her during the school year. It was a sacrifice i was willing to make, and i felt happier spending my time with her than with the people on campus. Though i did want to participate in school events and occasionally hang with friends on the weekends , this was the start of her abusive behavior via emotional control. She would make me feel guilty for wanting to spend time with my friends, which i never got to do during the school week. I was really in to magic the gathering at the time and we would like to play on the weekends.

After driving to her residence for nearly 2 years almost every weekend, i got a job near her place. She then enrolled in a community college, which was encouraged by me, my family, and her family. She wanted to go to school but wasn't confident enough to think she could commit to it. She moved 1.5 hours away from me, so again for the next 2 years I spent every weekend driving 3 hours to visit her. She ended up living with my parents for a few months until she was able to find an apartment of her own, during this time she was stressed about living with my parents, my parents were stressed about having her in their house and having to take her to school (her school was next to my dads office and their time schedule aligned). I did the math to see if it would be better to take an Uber to school every day or to buy a car.... I bought a car! A 2010 Buick LaCrosse for $8,500 USD. It was all under my name so if I needed to sell it and for liability reasons. I was only going to buy a car for her if I had complete ownership and she would he added to the insurance as the primary driver. Needless to say this put a lot of financial stress on me. She took great care of the car, just some minor cosmetic issues. I am really proud of her for being so respectful and responsible. 

After about a year at community college Covid hit and I dipped from my office letting my boss know i would be working from home. She and I moved in together at her apartment. I couldn't help her pay the bills except for utility because i was still broke and still paying for my apartment. Both of us just thought it made sense to live together during this time. This was a stressful time and I think subconsciously learned we were incompatible. Her desire to immediate get things done, while good, was not my style to be more casual. And our personalities really clashed during this time. After, what seems like, a year i moved back to my apartment because lockdowns were ""over"". I got a nice promotion and raise and life just became financially easy. 

During the next year or so I wanted a career change (best decision I have made). I tried really hard to find a position in the company to move in to, but ultimately i had to go with another company across the United States. She was relatively supportive of my decision and we continued a long distance relationship - we were accustomed to long distance so it was okay.

During her time in school at community college and her university, I helped her with her studies almost every day. I never asked for anything in return, just respect. Me helping became an expectation and put a lot of stress on me from the beginning of her schooling - i would help her read books (english is her second language) by reading all her books out loud and explaining things she didn't understand. I would read over and correct her papers too. She ended up graduating from Uni with no debt and with a 4.0. She really deserved it. After about 4 years of helping her with school it definitely took a mental strain on me. Working 9-12 hours and then correcting a 10 page essay with aweful grammar (I don't have the best grammar either) took a lot out of me. I am still trying to juggle having some semblance of a personal life, trying to make friends and just enjoy my freedom. Her last year in school, she barely needed my help and it was a major relief for me. She nearly became fully self-sufficient. That was awesome to see and I am really proud of her.

During our relationship i never told her about problems i faced, any negative emotions i felt or asked her for help. I could handle everything on my own. I really just needed her to be there as a partner and to bring peace (she is a chaos injector, so peace was hard to come by). 

The other day my girlfriend mentions, after a few years, she has something funny to say (she hates jokes and doesn't find anything really funny). She said, ""I just remember having a conversation with your dad and they asked me why I wanted to be with you. Your dad said you [me] have nothing I can provide. He won't be successful. He won't be rich. He isn't good looking. The only thing he has is he is loyal"". I have taken a lot of shit in my life from other people and have experienced a lot depression because of it. But hearing that this is something my dad supposedly said nearly broke me. It sent me down a bad path of depression. I became suicidal and I shut myself off from everyone for a few days. I later would confront my parents and they vehemently denied anything of the sort was said. I obviously want to believe them because they are my parents. I had reason to doubt them though and I continued to push. I pushed hard. They continued to deny the accusations. 

Yesterday, i brought it up to my girlfriend what they said and she was upset. I said, ""I have been extremely depressed the last week and I need your help. I need to sit you and my parents down together to have a conversation about what really was said"". Her immediate response was ""No i can't help you, i dont have the time"". I was shocked. This is the first time i ever asked for help. And i felt like after i reached my hand out for help she turned her back on me. I was immediately hurt. I expressed to her in a rational way how that hurts me and I continued to pleasd with her to help. She continued to deny me. After i cursed her out of anger and frustration. I hung up the phone in frustration. About 10 seconds later i call her again to apologize for cursing at her. It wasn't the adult way to handle it and i was really immature in that moment. She is crying saying how could i curse her and basically saying i am terrible and we need to break up. After talking for about an hour after this, she says, ""Fine if you want me to help you I will. But it will have to be in a couple months"". (She got a job in the admissions office at her school full time and says she doesn't have any free time because she needs time to relax with TV). She goes on to say that regardless what happens, if she talks with my parents our relationship is over because my parents will deny what she accused them of doing and she hates liars. 

I left out a lot of the failings of our relationship. I wasn't perfect and there is a lot I can improve. She felt like everything was perfect and she can't be wrong. Me addressing a problem she is causing would make her say, ""we are too different. Let's break up"". Over a small fixable problem. This was far too common to the point it was easier for me to not talk about problems because it could result in her saying let's break up. This happened last night too.",theschnipdip,1,2,1.0

I look at where I am in life and its the same place I was at 17, im doing a construction course that leads to a job at the end in a but its a 14 week course and I dont think I can handle another few months of living with my parents unemployed 

I have nothing against my parents we get on quite well but I simply need full indepenedance and self sufficiency. 

The last 3 years I have been bouncing back and forward between my parents house and my girlfriends parents house 800kms away hence the absense of career progress and on and off employment. 

I have tried to make my own work first busking and most recently mowing lawns but summer is almost over here now and I simply couldnt get enough clients doing lawns for full time work. Gonna do some more busking soon but that never paid very well.

I just feel so hopeless, I cant move out without a full time job and I just cant seem to get a job. All I know is manual labour and there isnt too much of that sort of work going atm.

Im sure eventually I'll land something but I feel like im slowly going stircrazy in the meantime. I train bjj and thats an amazing distraction but I havent even been able to do that for the last few weeks due to a skin infection.

131,Live service games & online only games,11ttiv5,"With Diablo IV releasing soon, i am once again reminded about how much i absolutely hate live service games and games that require a constant connection to the internet just to be able to play it. 

There have been so many games with cool & interesting ideas that have failed because they went the live service route. If they went the single player/offline route, those games would still be playable today. Now, i'm not saying that Diablo IV will fail. It won't because people are stupid enough to support them.

First of all, i have to pay full price to be able to play the game (fair enough) and then you add an in-game cash shop & battle passes. Things that you also have to pay for. 

Now i know what you're going to say, ""but you don't HAVE to pay for these"". While true, that's not the point. The point is, those things should already be obtainable for free, by actually PLAYING the game. I already gave you money to be able to play your game and now you are taking things that should've been obtainable for free, and are expecting me to pay for those. I shouldn't have to pay for cosmetic armor sets and weapons. I should be able to get those by playing your full priced game. It's a full price game, why are you presenting the real money shop like it's some feature everybody wants?

Diablo 4 Standard Edition Price - $69.99

Diablo 4 Digital Deluxe Edition Price - $89.99

Diablo 4 Ultimate Edition Price - $99.99

Imagine expecting people to buy from your in-game shop & pay for battle pass, with your game costing this much on top of it all.

There's also the problem with these types of game requiring a constant connection to the internet, otherwise you can't play it.

Imagine that, paying $70 for a video game and not being able to play because either your internet is acting up or something isn't working on their side. 

Also, what happens when the games' sales or performance are below expectations? They drop their support and now the game is dead in the water. You don't have access to the game that you paid money for. Isn't that insane? How can anyone defend this shit?

I also just don't want to deal with people. Let's be honest. People can be real assholes and sometimes you just want to get away from them, hop on a game, turn your mind off and relax. But with games like these you can't, because you're forced to play with others. I hate seeing xXfuckurmom69Xx running around my game. I hate people constantly being toxic towards other because they're either not playing the game ""correctly"" or simply because they just want to be an antagonistic asshole for no reason. And i hate having to rely on others to be able to access and enjoy certain content.

Worst of all, the same morons that support these trends are now asking for these cancerous trends to be added in every game that gets announced. Even games that simply would not work as a live service/online only type of game. Not every game needs to be Gaas damn it.

Sorry for the long rant, but these have been bothering me a lot lately. And i know that there are worse things to be upset about but i just had to get this off my chest. I hope these types of games just die off and don't ever come back. In a F2P game i can forgive some of this, at least to an extent. But in a full priced game? You can fuck right off. 

The fact that people are not only supporting, but defending these trends is honestly not that surprising. Because people are stupid.",ExtremelyEPIC,0,1,1.0

I always see videos like this and it's just lazy. What do they think they are doing exactly? It's just lazy and lame. If they have actual critiques of something, cool, but it would be something so small and insignificant it just seems like reaching. 

An example would be the PSVR2 being wired rather than wireless. Would it be cool if it was wireless? yes, but what affordable VR headset on the market has PS5 power and is wireless?

146,I can get through this shit too! I must remember that I am strong!,11tbj22,"This is long and ended up a trauma dump. But oh well, enjoy I guess.

From the ages of 3-11 I was abused and molested by a neighbour girl (a year older than me) and her parents. I have only recently reported it after the memory burst intonky kind one day as a barrage of flashbacks.

I survived!

From primary school to the very end of highschool so 5-16 I was bullied relentlessly. Physically and verbally I was treated like an animal someone hated. I had very few true friends and only one of them went to my highschool.

It's thanks to those freinds I have survived to this day.

From 11-16 I was molested by a man 5 years older than me. This was an almost daily occurance and he had a girl my age and a disabled girl with the mental age of a 5 year old join in. The guy and the girl my age would teach her what to do to md. The poor girl had no idea that she was torturing me because she thought it was a game.

I survived.

Age 12 a girl in school kicked me so hard in the stomach she caused my appendix to swell to the point I needed it removed. Then when I returned to school 3 girls ganged up on me and kicked the stitches out of me.

I literally survived someone's attempt to kill me.

Age 16 I lost my virginity to a man who was 23. He was too rough and left me bleeding for a week. I tried to get out of the relationship because he was a neo Nazi but he wouldn't let me leave. I finally got the courage to leave after I find out he is sleeping with my 13 year old cousin. He then went on to murder a man for being gay a year later. The body wasn't found for years, so I found out when I was 21. I had to give him a character reference and give the police a statement describing losing my virginity, every horrid painful gruesome detail. This was then read out in court. 

I still survived 

Still at 16 I found out I have a life long condition that will only get worse for the rest of my life. It is the first of many. 

I'm still surviving through the pain caused by this daily. I now have over 20 conditions and they're life altering. I am an electric wheelchair user because of constant dislocations. I can dislocated a shoulder or a hip just by sleeping funny.

Age 18-19 I was in a physically abusive with a 27 year old. He beat me to the point my joints would dislocate from my body. I only left him because I was forced to by freindsz after he beat me in my workplace so badly my whole left side was dislocated (shoulder, hip, knee, elbow and wrist). My friends wouldn't let me go back to the first home I ever rented. 

Thanks to my parents and friends I got through that.

19 I was sexually assaulted by a freinds flat mate when I tried to leave their house. He grabbed me and dragged me into the room and threatened people's safety if I screamed. The flat mates were all disabled except him. I believed he would hurt them. The police didn't believe me because ""no-one heard anything ""

I almost didn't survive that. 

19 again I met a 30 year old man who taught me what swinging was. He included tricking me into sleeping with people older than my own parents. The swinging was fun but kicked off a sex addiction which lead to me sleeping with over 300 men and women combined. He took me on expensive dates and bought me presents but wouldn't let me meet his son. I just this moment realised now I was a sugar baby and just didn't bloody know it! Anyway one day he came to pick me up for a swingers party and I was trying out a wheelchair as part of my physio and I was practicing in the dorm common room which had all around windows. He saw me through the window, made a face, dropped the roses he bought me and left. He later text me saying he ""COULDN'T SEE ME AS SEXY ANYMORE BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET THAT IMAGE OUT OF HIS HEAD!""

Screw that guy but I survived him and learned swinging is more fun in my control.

TRIGGER WARNING SUICIDE DISCUSSED A LOT AFTER THIS.

Age 20 I took two overdoses as I couldn't handle everything that happened in my life so far. The first one caused my heart to stop and it had to be restarted.i was drunk out of my mind, I drank 2L of rum before I left the house (I still can't drink rum to this day) I remember nothing between passing out and waking up. I had an out of body experience during the OD, watching myself take the pills from across the room. As soon as the last pill (54) was in my mouth I snapped back into reality and regretted my decision. 
Also during the OD recovery period I was allergic to one of the IV medications and nobody noticed me going into anaphylaxis. My mum came for a visit and Found me swollen and unable to breathe. The nurses had a change over and the new nurses just thought I was fat. 
The second wasn't as many pills but I had drank three bottles of wine, a freind of mine slept with the guy I liked after I asked her to introduce me. I was in earshot. I rifled through the guys cupboards and found and took every pill I could find. Which fortunately was not enough. And again after the frenzy I snapped back into reality, I called one of my best friends (she was my maid of honour) and she drove as fast as she could breaking speed limits to come and get me. She drove my ass to the hospital to get my stomach pumped.

Thanks to my freinds, my quick thinking once my right mind kicked in, my mum for saving me from an ironic death and especially the ambulance staff and the doctors who literally brought me back to life. I survived.

Age 20 I meet my son's father. We were together for four years. During this time we became engaged and set our wedding date, bought the dress, spent ¬£10k on a wedding in a castle. He ended things while I was in hospital on life support. But let's rewind just a little bit, from day one I told him that my condition would worsten throughout my life and had many comorbidities (conditions it can cause) and I would deteriorate. We decide to have a baby sooner rather than later as the older I am the less likely I am to survive pregnancy. I go through pregnancy aged 21-22 with my son with a 3% chance of survival, this dropped to a 0.01% if I have a C-section. I went through 3 days of full blown labor with no dialation. The doctors had never seen anything like it before (this will be explained soon). 

I survived a C-section after the most painful labour for three freaking days! Thanks once again to amazing skilled doctors and nurses, HCAs and other hospital staff!

Age 22 diagnosed with a 1-1million medical condition that causes bones to fuse wrong. I have an open fontanelle but fused pieces in my spine and a FUSED PELVIS! This is why I didn't dialate! It was physically impossible as my pelvis couldn't move to adjust. It was also why I suffered massive pelvic pain at the final trimester.

I'm surviving despite this and all my other conditions!

Age 24 I feel a pain in my chest and I am struggling to breathe. I ask my fianc√©, the father of my child to drive me to the hospital. He says no because he will be late to his new job (my brother in law was his boss) so I push my manual wheelchair to the bus stop slowly but surely. I make it to the bus stop and promptly collapse to the floor. I wake up surrounded by people, all neighbours who knew me from the estate. They had a blanket around me and a pillow under me, they asked me where I lived and I whispered the number while pointing down the road. They ran and got my fianc√©. He gets there just after I am loaded into the ambulance, he asks if I Will be okay, the paramedics shared a look and said they didn't know. They asked if he was coming and he said he was going to work and walked away without so much as an ""I love you"". I find out my lungs are coated in blood clots and had to undergo procedures to break them down. I couldn't breathe alone and couldn't talk. He waited 3 days before coming to the hospital didn't call once to check if was okay either, he then sat across from me and said this exact phrase ""I CAN'T HANDLE YOUR HEALTH ANYMORE!"" and called off our marriage and told me not to come home. Not to come home to my home, in my name, adapted for my needs as a wheelchair user.  So when I was ready for release out of the hospital I was asked my address for the ambulance drop off and I had a breakdown. I didn't have an address to give them. I had to call my mum and ask her to take me in. She opened her home to me and my son, though I moved into a friend's house after a week for my mental health. I lived with my friend for 6 months with my baby in a travel cot. This was my first time being homeless. I had to find a house for me and my baby. I finally did but we have now moved 5 x in 8 years.

 I survived another health scare and the end of the life I had planned ahead with the first man who had treated me right.

Age 25 my son's dad met a new girl, she has become my son's step mother and my ex's wife. I'm fine with her these days but back then I wasn't because of overstepping boundaries from her. Admittedly I'll thank her for this, my son's dad hadn't seen him in 8 months because he didn't want to see me. She told him ""if you don't start acting like a dad I'm never giving you kids"" unfortunately they then fought for full custody and I got supervised only visits. My son's dad acted like my conditions were worse than I let on.

I survived this and now have full shared custody. Though his dad takes him if I am in hospital or too ill.

Age 25 I meet my soulmate. He is the most kindhearted, warmest, sweetest, caring, most wonderful souls in the universe. The yin to my yang. My everything. We were a swinging duo to be envied. I loved everything about him and he was the perfect other half. If I could turn back time I would have never left. I would hog tie the old me in a basement and throw away the key to live a lifetime with him on my arm. Anyway not the point, the point is I royally fucked up. I suddenly had an urge to go back to uni again in the place I was assaulted. I saw it as an opportunity to face my past and get over my trauma (spoiler alert it didn't work)!. So off I move 100 miles away from everything. Including my son. Yeah I had a psychotic break I'm pretty sure after all the stress my son's dad caused.

I survived this with so much regret.


27I meet my soon to be ex husband. We met online, had a whirlwind romance where we were living together in 2 weeks and married at 5 months in. The first year and a half of marriage was bliss, then c-19 hit. Suddenly we were stuck together 24/7 which to begin with was great, then we both became depressed and frustrated, but he took.his frustration out on me. He withheld sex, using it as a weapon, started insulting me, ingraining into me that I was ugly, stupid, fat, lazy etc. A few times he has thrown stuff at me including a concrete hand casting kit. I finally left this year.

Now I must concentrate on surviving through every day.

30 left my abusive ex husband but had to live in the same house as him. The day after I told him things were over he sexually assaulted me in the early morning. I was forced to report it to the police when I broke down crying in my doctor's office. 

I'm still surviving...

31 I finally got help from the homelessness team in my old area. I've been living in hotels for weeks and my ex husband is still abusing me from a distance guilt tripping me about my stuff taking up room, or our dog or anything he can come up with. 

I will get through this! I AM A SURVIVOR!

Now this is a message for me. If you are reading this, you are doing enough, you are worth it, ask your freinds for help, you are beautiful, you are outgoing, you are an amazing mother, you do deserve love, you deserve to be happyn

Keep on surviving!!",xxasynixxx,0,2,0.75

She instantly tries to start up conversation with me asking if the pool is warm etc. Just bit of small talk the kid laughs giggles and says something about me reminding her of john cena, i'd guess the kid was about 7-9 area (this is a mild guess though) The kid is very nice and makes a lot of comments in the pool. after about 4 minutes if that the mother goes hey you don't mind if I just leave her with you while I go get something from my room or something like that.... No this is not a fucking joke...

I said eh what? Not really tbh you don't really know me not really safe to leave her do you think?

Mother comes back ""Oh im sorry love"" I said long 5 minutes eh? Said it very nasty/rude but she some how seems oblivious to that ""Oh did you have fun millie with chris"" I'm like what the fuck... I said bye to the kid and left the pool while just starring at the mother who has her feet dipping back into the pool while on her phone. Ended up going to the hot tub.

150,Fuck your fucking app,11t4rtk,I work as a cashier at a grocery store. We have one of those apps with digital coupons. Guess what? It's St Patricks day tommorow. Guess what the digital coupons are? Cabbage and potatoes. Guess what the average age of the customers are? 60+. Half of them can't even figure out how to pay by tapping their damn card.

I'm sure you all have something similar nationwide. This thing is the bane of my existence.

All my most cherished memories is here and now I will have too leave it cause our government don't care for us except the rich and especially the rich white. They don't care about the shootings, not giving us free healthcare, removing guns from citizens, the racism, the political divide, the toxic work culture, POC specifically non black Hispanics and black people  having too be scared of cops instead of feeling safe around them, The threat of being caught in a mass shooting, the wages not matching the pricing of rising food, rent, home price cost, gas cost, the terrible walkability of majority of the cities in this country and terrible public transportation . These are all the reasons why I'm leaving the USA forever cause I know no matter how much we protest or vote we won't ever have it as good like a lot of other countries. So the best way I can save myself is by leaving if the USA turns out the way I want it I might come back who knows but it's been almost 250 years since the USA formed and barely anything has changed and changed for the worse.

157,I don't want this anymore,11su2rr,"I am a bi dude, student at a university in Romania. For some background, initially I was disillusioned with engineering so I dropped it and went onto political science, because I thought i'd like it. But here is the kicker, i joined pol sci because I wanted to meet politically literate people, while there might be some, they are the exception, some teachers are straight up christo-fascists, historical revisionists, antisemites, homophobic, transphobic and with all manner of bigotry, two teachers stand out in this aspect, the english teacher and the history teacher, they're both antisemitic pieces of shit, they recommend lectures from fucking conspiracy theorists and fascist simpatizers, Alex Jones, FUCKING ALEX JONES, was cited by our history teacher. Just today the english teacher was showing us a documentary about ""the evil satanists"" and ""the cabal that controls the world"". Besides it being a load of fucking nonsense, it relies on the viewer being a christofascist POS to believe it, I am not that since I don't believe in any deity. Now onto the other problem, my colleagues, they just don't care, I wish I was like them, but I cannot in my right mind tolerate fucking alt-right propaganda IN THE FUCKING CLASSROOM, at a POLITICAL SCIENCE faculty. When I show these concerns of mine, my colleagues just play it off as ""oh it's just another opinion"" or ""oh it's just another belief"", and how when I attack religion as the basis of the teacher's argument, I am attacking them also, because they're believers also. If it's another opinion or belief, WHY THE FUCK SHOULD I CARE? WHY IS IT TAUGHT?

More and more problems arise, I addressed these problems to a teacher who is actually nice, twice, and he was agreeing something needs to change, but nothing has been done since.

I am out to my mom, and she constantly invalidates my existance as bi, and she always backs off from a serious discussion about her biases with a ""I was grown with these values"". I get it, coming to terms with you kid not being straight takes time, thanks to this heterosexism that is the norm. But at some point she'll have to choose between me and her shitty ""values"".

Another thing about my mom, when I was little, idk if she was realizing it or not, she was trying to indoctrinate me into christianity, by going to church even though i didn't want to, she was showing me a fucking cultist that was saying that ""modern technology is turning your kids into demons"" or some bs. Basically she was subscribing to this christofascist ideas too.

And now the thing that made me write this rant in the first place, I was telling my mom about these shitty teachers constantly, to the point she got fed up with it, but instead of blaming the teachers she blames me. Today, after all that bullshit at the english course, which I would honestly call it ""alt-right indoctrination session"" and indirectly being invalidated because both of these teachers think queer people are possessed, or have something wrong with them, or worse, that we are the product of the ""globalist cabal to depopulate the world"" and how anything that says otherwise is basically ""tainted science"" by an ""evil ideology"". Basically a self-sealing conspiracy theory about ""New World Order"" bullshit, promoted at a FUCKING UNIVERSITY, WITH NOTHING TO BACK IT UP BECAUSE IT'S JUST NONSENSE, and when you call out these teachers they become INCREDIBLY hostile, The history teacher said how he's against historical revisionism, and I wanted to continue on that idea, and so I said how one of our country's most beloved writer ""Octavian Goga"" was also a fascist politican that had a political party who was just antisemitic, and he deadass replied ""He wasn't a fascist, this is just anti-romanian lies and propaganda"" He was also denying the genocide against jewish people, he's the equivalent of a german holocaust denier but for Romania.  The english teacher was talking about christian and muslim views on Jesus, and I, wanting to stir the pot because I had nothing better to do, said ""Ok what about the perspective of Jesus being an impostor"" basically, I said the jewish perspective to see her reaction and OH BOY, was it bad, (her being an antisemitic piece of shit doesn't help) she started shouting at me on ""how do you know it? you weren't there"", this is of course, extremely ironic and when I call out her bullshit, my colleagues started being annoyed at ME, I am sorry, this is just my ""opinion"" deal with it, you know like that ""opinion"" these christofascist teachers have about gay people, that being, that they shouldn't exist.

I voiced all these concers to my mom (big mistake) and it devolved into her threatening to out me to my dad, so that he can ""deal with it"" (it being my sexuality), and from there it all went downhill, I started screaming, hitting and shouting at her for all the bullshit I am going through and how she doesn't fucking care and does not approach these situations well, her first reaction to voicing my concerns is ""why do you care so much?"", ""i have no issues with anyone, why do you?"" this being in the context of the CHRISTOFASCIST teachers. These teachers that glorify the fucking fascists of this country and are willing to lie and revision history because they think it is ""anti-romanian"" to address ROMANIAN FASCISM AND THE GENOCIDE UNDER IT

The thing I hate the most is this, both my parents were telling me that ""oh you dropped from engineering, you'll drop from the next thing also"" and I wanted to prove them wrong, but they might be right, obviously for a very bullshit reason, I DO NOT TOLERATE FASCISTS TEACHING, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health, I was diagnosed with depression months ago, so that doesn't help, and I am thinking of quitting, but I don't know what to do from there, and I am honestly scared living in this country, I want to move out but I don't know when I'll be able to.

I grew up in Spain and I was bullied there for being a ""stealing romanian"" and I was hoping my life would be better here because I won't be bullied on the basis of nationality, but, in time, I learned that this country is a shithole in all aspects, I do not care about your ""traditional values"" when they exist to erase my rights and existance, I do not care about your religion when it's weaponized against queer people. And so with all this it seems like I have no place to call home, I feel like nationality is a dangerous construct and is inherently a bad thing, In Spain i was rejected for being romanian, in Romania i am rejected because i am queer, i am tired about all of it.

TL:DR Queer guy that has been living with religious trauma tired of all the apathetic people around him that enable christofascist teachers to disseminate far-right propaganda and discriminate queer people.

160,Betrayed by the Government,11suyt7,"The health department of the state government.

Two years ago, I became a pandemic specialist. I joined a group of pandemic specialists and we handled outbreaks in all types of facilities including the local hospitals in our health district. Last year, we were officially absorbed by the local health district. They promised that our role is permanent and that our job is to minimise hospital acquired infection and control outbreaks of any kind.

This Monday, they told us they're letting us go. They know they can't fire us so they want us to work in other departments. They wanted us to pick a department and make a final decision by Wednesday.

We were all shocked as it was too abrupt and there was no transition period. I bought a property recently. Before I bought it, I considered everything. The type of job that I have, my pay, and my financial status. My plan was derailed in an instant and now they want me to choose immediately. They want me to change my career that I planned for myself in an instant because they want us to start in other departments next week.

I had a hunch when my previous manager resigned early this year. My new manager (well, now my previous manager as well), is conveniently on a 2-week holiday. No transition program, no clear direction, no formal letter was given to our team or to any of us.

We were betrayed and we are being driven out asap. We're being treated as dispensable workers by executives whose job is to sit in their offices and earn 120 to 200k a year.

At the moment, I'm thinking if this is a battle I could fight. At the moment, I'm thinking if I should involve the union. However, considering that I'm moving houses, all the expenses that I have, and learning that the career plan that I planned is now a waste, I don't know if it will be worth it.",notbornnotraisedOZ,0,6,1.0

This is kinda long,

This last 2 weeks I've been feeling bad, like anxious over everything, no motivation most of the time, I'm really conflicted about my emotions in various levels, I'm not someone to just spill all I feel to other people cuz I don't want to burden them and because a lot of the time I feel like it's not as important as it is, yesterday after taking some desicions and my overthinking getting the better of me I ended up in a bad spot, and really needed to talk to someone about what was going on with everything, so I texted my two friends from school (note that we aren't on school anymore, we are university students and each one has their own career path on different universities).

I asked one if he could hear me out for a while cuz I needed some help, he said he was busy, if it could be tomorrow, I said ok I understand, then I asked my other friend through ig (I was evading WhatsApp at the time) and she never opened my messages.

After a while I finally calmed down and texted a friend from university, she heard me out and helped me through my stuff, so everything was ok from then, but now, the next day after that, the friend that told me to talk to him the next day never checked on me again even tho I told him it was important (and no, he is not busy cuz his university just got on strike so all work is paused) and is just sending memes, and my other friend who didn't even open my ig messages just posted on her stories and proceeded to text me on WhatsApp cuz ""OMG my boyfriend just posted my pictures on his stories, isn't he cute?"" And I'm like, bro, yesterday I was in the middle of a breakdown and you never responded, you got into Instagram and published new stuff and now text me to just show off your boyfriend?? Not even check if I needed to talk cuz, well, I texted you last night asking that explicitly?

Now, I don't wanna be self centered or anything, they have their own lifes, they have their own stuff, I can't expect them to prioritize me over what they are doing at the moment they receive the messages, but I feel hurt, every time they needed me to listen to their problems and help them through them I did, and when I need help, when I finally need to open up after keeping too much inside they just, don't care, don't pay attention, and just continue talking like nothing is happening.

I'm just really sad, I need some insight to know if I'm exaggerating or if what I feel is justified, maybe it's childish, I don't know, I just know that it's hurting me right now and not helping my anxiety at all.

162,I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs going to get back with his ex,11t8kxo,"I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; I'd just watch the videos.

A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers, but whenever I'd watch his videos, a few hours later, my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days; eg. I'd watch his videos one day, watch it two days later, then the day after, and each time I saw them, my views went up, and on the days that I didn't watch them, they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Now, it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time, he even posted a TikTok in English (English isn't his first language, and all of his previous videos were in his native language).

TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time, I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later, he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English, and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny, but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.

However, twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up, he started following her on TikTok, but unfollowed her within a few hours (probably because she didn‚Äôt follow him back). A month later, one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on, he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok, because TikTok tells who looks at your profile.

I am often judged and told that ""you need cursive for signing important documents"" however as previously said I have my OWN way of writing my signature. I get that it's easily forgeable but guess what? I'm not that important man. Seriously I'm not a head of state, I'm not a business owner, and my signature will never touch a document that is of importance to another person. Nobody will make money off of a signature that already changes as I get older. One day I will likely learn proper cursive but by then my peers (other gen Z) will likely also have not been taught cursive and thus not know it. 

I get that this is a shit take and my opinion is stupid okay. I'm just annoyed that nobody listens to me when I try to make a point of this.

173,I refuse to call myself vegan,11smaub,"I have been plant based for 5 years now. I hate how preachy the vegan community can be. Acting like they are better than everyone else. Criticizing people who are trying their best to be more plant based. They act like if they aren‚Äôt fully vegan, might as well not even bother. My philosophy is, as long as your trying, your making a difference. I encourage people to include more plant based options in their diet. It‚Äôs better for the planet, your health and of course the animals. If the entire population of the US are plant based for just half of their meals, there would already be tremendous impact

But bullying people into veganism almost never works. 

I remember at one point I got heavily criticized by my vegan Facebook group for buying a leather belt at a local store after my belt broke just a half hour before my work shift. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve went to other stores‚Äù. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not vegan‚Äù. Etc.  as if I had a choice.

Or another time when my dad brought me back a purse from Qatar that happened to be made of suede. Told me I should donate it or ‚Äúreturn it‚Äù girl how am I gonna return this?? And my dad bought is specially for me. I‚Äôm not just gonna give to away. Isn‚Äôt that wasteful??

There was a period of time where I wasn‚Äôt plant based. I had broken my arm, had to get surgery and was in a cast for nearly three months. It was my dominant hand so I really couldn‚Äôt cook and obviously couldn‚Äôt work or drive myself to the store. So I had to eat what my parent had, which for the most part wasn‚Äôt vegan. And they were having financial trouble so I wasn‚Äôt about to ask them to make special meals. They were taking care of me. But again I was criticized by vegans online. 


They also seem to forget that not everyone has access to vegan foods. Some people live in food deserts where the only things around are convenience store and fast food places. And many don‚Äôt have vegan options. Or people simply can‚Äôt afford a plant based diet. And while they argue that cheap things like beans and rice are vegan, whose just gonna live on beans and rice?? Idk what I would do if I didn‚Äôt have access to morning star or beyond meat. I love my just egg and my Annie‚Äôs vegan Mac. Telling poor people they should just live off rice and beans simply to save a few animals, is classist.

Due to me failing 3 classes, I was unable to switch from general engineering to my specific engineering major. And now that I'm certain I can get back in my academic swing I'm applying for computer science/engineering/computing, I was talking to the advisors about my application and degree plan so I can still graduate in 2025. And instead of plans to get me to my destination I was met with all of them telling me my G.P.A was too low and I have no chance at getting into any of the majors. 

No matter who I went to they basically told me that engineering may not be for me. all because my G.P.A was low. Like, I wasn't partying or getting drunk, I barely hung out with friends all past 2 years and when I did catch up to the content I understood it pretty well I was just very behind and I barely indulged in my hobbies. I will admit I had shitty attendance but that's not because I was slacking of or anything I was just in a bad place at the time.

Now I've finally gotten the help I needed, none of the administrators actually care about anything but my G.P.A. I basically have to settle for any engineering program that will take me if I get rejected or I need to write ""some incredible essays"" If I even want a shot at having my application hollistically reviewed. 

How am I supposed to write an essay explaining how I'm not too stupid to do engineering with only 250 words!!!

Now everytime I see those anti suicide posters saying your grade doesn't matter or they don't define you it literally feels like a slap in the face because your grades do define you. There's literally so many things I can't do because of my GPA and even if I retake the class and get an A or B the old grade I got still drags down my GPA so it's like they don't even care if you learn from your mistakes. I'm so angry, I feel so hopeless cause I don't know if I'll get into the major i want this semester and I hate the idea of having to settle for a shitty major I don't want cause I don't want to get kicked out of the engineering program for not specifying which engineering I'm going to.

Let's be real, I know I'm not you and I have no bloody clue what you are going through. 

But NO ONE wants to keep on hearing the same old story about your struggles with depression and whatnot for another round, especially if anything we say gets dismissed immediately.

You have made it your entire personality for years now.

The best part? I don't actually know how to treat you anymore:

I ask you out - you refuse because it's to much to handle - faire enough.

I don't ask you out for the reason given above - you feel left out and offended because we did not ask (and formulate it as if I'm  actually trying to make you feel bad).

If I complain how something has been hard, you get hyper defensive and make us feel bad because we have NO IDEA what hard is....you always have it worse than any of us.

Everyone has to be aware of anything they say as it might either trigger you or it is per defacto political incorrect and that makes us bad humans for that. But hey, when we call you out on the same you are offended and are not allowed to have fun...

I have honestly run out of f\*\*\* to give about you and your problems and have no desire anymore to even try and cater to your needs as a friend due to that. I've tried for years and I feel like you will never get better unless you get checked into a facility, but you are not ready for this conversations and will just change your therapist again....

I feel bad for your life partner, because this person loves you soo much, it does not see the endless loop it has created within your relationship and the relationship with other people. Like the mood switches when you guys are around.

You know the feeling when you all gather at a friend's house, you and your ""crew"" but you haven't seen each other in a while because of work, distance etc.? So you're all **finally** together and you realize just how much you've missed these people. You wanna know about all the fun things they've done, share some of your own crazy stories and tonight's the night because who knows when the schedule gods will allow you to meet again.

So y'all start drinking a bit, everybody brought their own drinks but you all end up sharing, one story comes after the other, you joke around, tease each other, laugh... After a while, the conversation turns serious, you discuss your life issues, your financial problems, break ups, new jobs, moving towns, etc. But seriousness can only last for so long because someone cracks a joke and it's all back to fun and sharing crazy stories.

Then someone utters the blasted phrase: ""Yo, guys, I got this new board game, I've never played it, let's try it.""

All of the sudden you might as well have gotten together with a bunch of strangers because the game is all that matters now. And it's never one of those games that allows banter and lighthearted conversation, it always has to be some new, very complex game with a rule book as thick as my foot is fucking wide.

And for those of you who think I'm retarded because I find it hard to understand a game rulebook: I'm not retarded, I'm just not competitive. I have no desire or drive to win in games so memorizing the rules to achieve something I don't care about becomes extra difficult. I can solve physics problems, I can do finite element analysis, I can translate or design complex parts because those are things where  ***care*** about the outcome.

190,"I don‚Äôt like my dad‚Äôs wife, and I feel like I‚Äôm being pushed out of our home.",11sgmz7,"For some quick context: 
I am 19 
I work part time, but earn ¬£1200 a month. At the moment I am currently applying for full time jobs.
The bills I have to pay every month add up to ¬£375, this does not include subscriptions, or my monthly petrol cost. 
My mother died when I was very young, my dad entered a 9 year relationship a month after her death, and had a new girlfriend two months after his split with his gf of 9 years. He is now married again, after only being in a relationship for a year. 

Me & my dad have a rocky-ish relationship. We love each other very much, but we both have the same argumentative attitudes and we are both stubborn. So when we do fight, it‚Äôs not very good. 

Over the past few months I have been saving some of my wage towards buying a house in the future, I wanted to continue with my education so I would also need to work less hours as-well to get the relevant qualifications for the career I want. I only started saving for a house, because my dad told me in 3 or 4 years he wanted to sell his house. I was okay with this because I‚Äôm getting older so I have to leave at some point, and also because he has arthritis so he is struggling with the stairs. 

Last year my dads new, at the time, girlfriend moved in along with her son. It was awkward because I‚Äôd only ever met her son once or twice and now he lived in my house. 
I worked 50 hour weeks from I was 16 until I was 18, and because I wasn‚Äôt in school I had to pay my dad some rent money. So I give my dad ¬£160 on the 24th of every month, and I have never missed paying him. No one else in my house gives my dad the rent money he asks for, apart from me. 

The stranger that lives in my house is a good 6 years older than me, and doesn‚Äôt have a job. He sleeps all day and plays XBOX all night. If I get up to use the bathroom, my dads wife says I have woken her up and will complain all day about it. What I don‚Äôt understand is, her sons bedroom is right beside theirs and she doesn‚Äôt hear him screaming at his Xbox all night. I have slept through a riot, in which people were screeching and throwing petrol bombs, but I do not sleep through this dude yelling at a mic all night. His shouting wakes me up at-least once a night, but when I say something about it it‚Äôs brushed under the rug. 

Then last week my dad tells me he‚Äôs selling the house this year, so I need to move out. I‚Äôm really bummed out because I wanted to BUY a house, but now I will need to rent because my savings aren‚Äôt adequate and it‚Äôs such short notice. His wife is being really passive aggressive about it, and basically turns everything into a weird argument. The other day I said there was no chips in the freezer so she turned round and said I wouldn‚Äôt need to worry because there would be plenty in my own house. Anytime I have a shower she says it‚Äôs disgusting and I haven‚Äôt cleaned it and she knows it was me because there is fake tan in the shower. I don‚Äôt wear fake tan, I‚Äôm literally pasty as hell.

Now they are telling me I need to get rid of everything in my bedroom, and rearrange all my furniture so they can take pictures. I have nowhere to live yet, and I‚Äôm upset because everything in my room I paid for. My dad has even requested I throw out all my music stuff as-well. I have 2 guitars, a bass, and a big peavy amp that I regularly use so I don‚Äôt know why I need to throw them out just because he‚Äôs selling his house. 

At night time my dads wife requests I put my car on the driveway, then parks hers behind mine and refuses to move it for me in the morning. I don‚Äôt want to be rude by saying no, because I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôll tell on me to my dad and he‚Äôll be upset with me. 

What is annoying me most about this? When they move they are only taking one person with them. Her son! Fair enough, he is unemployed, but so is one of my brothers! He also sits at home all day and plays Xbox, but he actually gets shouted at for it. 

I‚Äôm just really annoyed, I never miss my rent payments, and I‚Äôm never home to annoy anybody. I‚Äôve never had a gap in my employment history, and I‚Äôm not a freeloader. I‚Äôm the only one out of the 4 of us children in the house with a driving license, and my dad is just like welp Gluck. 

They keep telling me to just move out and get a house with my boyfriend, but they‚Äôre not taking into consideration that he does not want to move out right now. He‚Äôs shit out of luck in his very deep overdraft, and I am helping him to get himself out of it. He is switching jobs in 2 weeks to one that is a lower paying wage because they‚Äôll put him through his apprenticeship, so we just cannot afford it even together. 

I feel like I‚Äôm too young to take this on, and I‚Äôm sick of my dad throwing me off the deep end because he said no one helped him when he was younger. I don‚Äôt mean in terms of money, like just how to do basic adulting tasks. 

I‚Äôm so fed up. I‚Äôm sick of his wife telling lies about me, and just making stuff difficult. On a weeknight I am never home later than 10pm because of work, and if my dad isn‚Äôt home she will tell him I didn‚Äôt come home until like 3AM. Why would you lie about that?",sheselectr1c,1,3,0.72

California, Florida, across the Midwest, even a little bit of the Northeast, some far away island countries. It's fair to say I've seen bad drivers, or at least a different ""social contract"" of driving. But Maryland? God you guys are the worst fucking drivers I have ever had the displeasure of sharing the roads with in my entire life. You somehow combine all the aggression, idiocy, selfishness and nonchalance of all of the worst places I've ever driven.

Maryland is the Australia of driving: everyone on the streets is trying to kill you. 

You don't use turn signals, ever. Like, fuck. They're literally free. Just fucking use them. Don't cut me off at 2 feet in front of my car after just now deciding to change lanes.

You don't a shit about anyone around you and speed along like it's fucking Forza Motorsport. Guess what? We're both getting to that light at the same goddamn time. Now you see racers and weavers and hotrodders everywhere, but in Maryland it is quite literally a daily occurence.

I'm not even sure what you think of lanes, because it seems like the separation of lanes is a mere suggestion rather than a rule. Oh, and you include the shoulder as a lane. The left lane is I guess for everyone else, and the right lane is for you to speed and pass on, like literally no one else in the country does.

One more thing: [This is me every single day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRjCOZ2z8dM) Because somehow you riding my bumper on a multilane highway is going to get us there faster. Because it'll move the car in front of me faster. I give a respectable one car distance between me and the car in front of me, but you? You're all up in my shit and I'm tired of it. One of these days I'm going to break check you and send you flying through your windshield. 

I should probably add that I can't even keep the one car distance anymore and have to inch just a little closer so one of you idiots doesn't try and cut me off, because sure I'll slam on my breaks so you can decide to change lanes (without a turn signal I bet).

196,Don‚Äôt invalidate my thoughts just because you disagree with me,11s705c,"Like seriously, if you‚Äôre going to disagree with me at least tell me why instead of saying ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a garbage take‚Äù over and over, and stating that I‚Äôm only trying to be ‚Äúunique‚Äù and patronizing me for having a different (although understandably radical) point of view. And the worst thing is he said I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúthought about it enough.‚Äù Like bro how the hell can you know that. I have, in fact, thought this through for quite a while and have had proper conversations with others, something you clearly seem incapable of doing. And I value my capability to think immensely, so to be told this just makes me so ridiculously mad. I wish I could prevent this from affecting me so much. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing to be gained from just invalidating a person and their thoughts, saying that I‚Äôm countering myself when you won‚Äôt even let me finish my sentences. I‚Äôve lost any respect I had for this person ‚Äî we are literally in a class that teaches us the importance of listening, being open minded, and embracing complexity and this dude goes and says ‚Äúsome things are simply right or wrong‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just pretending to be complex‚Äù and not even actually stating why he disagrees with me in the first place. And on top of that, cutting me off so many times by just repetitively saying loudly that it‚Äôs a bad take. like have some self awareness for fuck‚Äôs sake. and this was a philosophical topic and I literally have more credentials than him, I‚Äôve written a 4000 word essay on the basis of morality and I‚Äôm in a college level philosophy class. And when I mentioned that he‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôve rEaD a BoOk.‚Äù I may be overreacting at this point and I probably shouldn‚Äôt let him get to me like this but invalidating more than a year of work and many, many hours of studying just makes me so goddamn mad.

All I‚Äôve learned from this is that there are people who aren‚Äôt willing to listen, and it just makes me so sad that people like this exist. I understand now why some people aren‚Äôt willing to change their mind ‚Äî it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre forced to argue with people like this who use personal attacks as opposed to a rational discussion that involves sharing ideas and actually learning something valuable from one another.",urbanwaves10,0,6,0.88

198,I get personally offended when people say the R word,11sb702,"I don't have any special needs. But I struggle with social anxiety, and when I was younger, several people asked my parents if I had autism or any other sort of special needs. I would get beat after for embarrassing them. When I was in high school, a classmate was harassing me, and called me an ""autistic loser"". Ever since then, I've been extremely sensitive when people talk about special needs people in a rude way. I hate that I'm like this. I don't have any special needs, so I shouldn't get offended. But whenever someone says some slur like ""retarded"" or ""retardo"", I want to beat the living crap out of that person. I don't care.

199,I am a young (26F) manager and people are rude to me.,11s8eh0,"I work in food service, leading a small team. I often go out of my way to make sure the staff is happy and take their complaints seriously - however, if I need to enforce something such as writing someone up for lack of a better term, being lazy and not doing the job correctly - they sulk and blame me, even when it is genuinely their own doing that got them written up.

If I have to enforce that they wear the proper slip resistant shoes, they challenge me (I can understand it's rough economically right now, but I'm just doing my job). I always give people the days off that they request because I know they have lives, but it does not seem to matter what I do, some of these people use me as a punching bag. I've had people no call no show, people create drama & lies about others and myself, people cuss me out for things completely out of my control, people call in sick because they didn't like that I told them to change one minor thing or put them in their place. 

It's often said managers are assholes, and I've had my fair share of bad managers myself, but I've never seen employees be so rude to a boss in their life. If i'm nice, lenient and give them what they want, I'm never thanked or appreciated. If I'm strict, enforce rules and tell them how it is, I'm a huge bitch. I can't win.",capo-22,2,4,1.0

**Noteriety,** according to the Cambridge Dictionary means "" the state of being famous for doing something especially something immoral or **bad**:  **being famous for something bad.""**

203,Why am I expected to show so much sympathy/emotion??,11rky4j,"In all actuality, I don't understand, it's recently came to light in a more open manner to me that I'm supposed to show a certain amount of reaction to things. I already
pretend/act out most of my emotions. (Laughing, smiling, etc, more than I would naturally in front of
people) and I've been told that I don't seem to meet this invisible standard of how much emotion I need to
show?? My family has been down in the dumps recently, and something really good is happening, I'm
obviously happy about it but my friend told me that my reaction was way too nonchalant and lackluster, like
almost mad. Idk how I'm supposed to respond to this stuff? Shouldn't it be obvious that I'm excited, why do I
have to pretend to be so excited about it? I'm already mentally and emotionally exhausted from keeping up my faces all day, I shouldn't have to do it in the comfort of my own home as well, right? Like I literally fake my
accent for my friends so they can understand me. (I'm white, just come from a hilly-billy town and it shows in
my accent) why do I need to fake my emotions to the extent that it feels literally comical to do it? And this
get called lackluster?? It makes me want to pull my hair out. Not to mention sometimes I see people doing
things that seem so stupid/unreasonable, to me at
least, (crying for a dead relative they never met, and another time, forcing someone, me, to give up the
memorial card they were making for their dog to someone else, because the death of a fellow person is
more important.) and getting so much attention and no one ever seems to question their response to it? The
death of a relative you never met is about the same as seeing someone in your town passed away to me at
least. Idk tho, i could just be weird like my friends say but I'm not too sure. My father is the exact same way, so I guess it's something I get from him.

Roughly 14 hours into my 24 hour shift, I passed out. I guess my boss was calling me on the radio while I was out because she came looking for me and found me asleep. The job is super lenient and she‚Äôs friends with my dad so she just yelled at me and moved on. 

16 hours in I pass out again. She finds me again. Yells harder.

I hold my integrity to the highest value, and I am not going to agree with you on things that I disagree on, and I'm not going to entertain conversations that I think are stupid and rather bigoted. 

I know, I can just ""ignore"" it, and I try to. But being surrounded by such negative energy 80% of the time is so draining. I feel like I ""should have nothing to say"" because I'm still living under her roof and am financially dependent.

209,Google search sucks now,11r6p1k,"Using Google search has become an exercise of weeding through a sea of links that lead to spam articles or worse yet, paywalls for news and content. 

 
I get the Internet is ‚Äúevolving;‚Äù but, you‚Äôd think these big brains at Google would adjust their algorithms to keep their golden goose relevant. 

Searching for content, I need to navigate through paid ad links, that I don‚Äôt have an interest in. Next, I need to review the link choices to me as publishers have laced their content with keywords and lengthy (often garbage) content that is of no help to me.  

Finally, and worst of all, searching for news with Google is a joke. Google does nothing to separate publications that have pay walls from those offering free content. Why? They know people want information on what they‚Äôre searching for and don‚Äôt want to click a link to get a damn subscription blocker in front of them.

Now we‚Äôre told about ChatGPT and other AI moving into search‚Ä¶ I know it‚Äôs going to lead to more spam content and useless searches.

211,So sick of watching people die,11rfurv,"I‚Äôm currently living in a nursing home and rehab facility recovering from a hemmorhaggic stroke that has paralyzed my left side and has left me wheelchair and bed bound.  I‚Äôve been here nearly three years now and I have made several new friends during bingo and other activities- last summer, my friend Daniel got sick out of nowhere and was hospitalized, instead of coming back to the facility, his wife decided to take him somewhere closer to home and then he passed.  It was upsetting, especially since the last time I saw him before he was hospitalized, he wasn‚Äôt quite himself.  Then my neighbor with dementia fell out of bed and suffered a broken hip for nearly a month without it being caught- we weren‚Äôt really friends but I helped her with things when I could- like holding her cup so she could get a drink or picking her pillow up from the floor and placing it back under her head she‚Äôd say‚Äùthank ya, darling‚Äù so sweetly and she always seemed so scared so I‚Äôd sing to her from across the hall or play music or an audio book for her to calm her- because she was in pain for so long her health deteriorated quickly towards the end, I sat talking with her family members while they kept vigil and then she passed.  Recently another across the hall neighbo, who was also a stroke survivo, was hospitalized after having what they called a ‚Äúmini stroke‚Äú.  Every day she would be up and down the hal- she was a familiar presence but once she came back from the hospital she was not able to get up in her chai, she just stayed in bed until she passed two weeks ago.  Our94 year old neighbor down the hall walked into my room the other day to ask about her and I had to keep her up when I broke the news to herand broke her heart.    Now, another neighbor a few doors down was hospitalized last week.  I was told yesterday that she was still alive but that she was not coming back to this facility .  Surprisingly today she was brought back but it‚Äôs bad, I doubt that she will survive the night .  I only just befriended her right before Christmas and I enjoyed chatting with her but right now the thing in her bed is NOT  her.

212,I was ghosted by the man I was talking to for a year and I don‚Äôt know what to feel about it.,11rse1b,"I met this guy online a year ago and we had been talking ever since. We live a thousand miles apart. I wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship, I was just looking for online friends. After a few days of constantly talking, I felt a connection that we started to flirt to each other. This went on for months. Talking and flirting here and there. We would also talk on phone almost every night but the constant calls happened a few months before the year ended. 

At first, I thought he just liked talking to me and liked to have fun and that he doesn‚Äôt plan to take this seriously. One day, he told me he had plans on visiting my country and meet up with me. So I was like, this guy must be really serious about me that he wanted to fly to my country to see me. At that time, I had already developed feelings for him but it got deeper when I learned about his plan. His plan to see me based on what he told me, never happened. I asked him about it then he said it would be at the end of the month. I tried to shrug it off because I was thinking that maybe he was just joking. But our communication never stopped. After that, I noticed he was becoming distant‚Äîslow replies, not too eager to talk to me anymore, and he would take days to respond but that also didn‚Äôt stop me from having feelings for him. 
Then on December, he told me he would really come by January. Mid-December, he was showing disinterest in me by not texting me that often, not calling anymore, not reading my messages and he would only text back once a week. I asked him what was wrong, he said it‚Äôs all good, he was just really busy with work and life. 
I tried my best not to get affected. 
New year came, he sent me wishes and called me a week after. I texted him after that, then he responded one week after as well. It really made me sad because he was giving me false hope and made me think that I was just overthinking. He is a straightforward type of person but he can‚Äôt even straight up tell me that he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore. 
I had already fallen for him and it made things worse for me. At the end of January, he completely ghosted me. His last text to me was I shouldn‚Äôt stress anything and I was just overthinking. 

It‚Äôs been a month and a half and I still get crushed every time I think about it. It made me feel worthless and made me think that I am undeserving of any explanation. It would not be a big deal to me if we had been only talking for a short time but we kept in touch for a year and he was leading me on all this time. I thought he was serious about me.

Everyone that knows him has been raped by him, including me. And the police won‚Äôt do shit because he‚Äôs mentally ill and jail time wouldn‚Äôt do him any good. 

He flirts with everyone that has a pulse, tries to have sex with anyone that has a pulse and if they reject him he will whine and get them drunk and then have sex with them, he did that with a girl while she was in a relationship he just didn‚Äôt care and said they could drink together and she didn‚Äôt want that, but he gave a drink anyway and she drank it, she apparently drank so much she blacked out and the other friend that was with them didn‚Äôt do anything, just saw him having sex with the drunk girl. It fucked her up so much, she couldn‚Äôt talk about it for ages. 

There is a lot of stories like that, and everyone just stopped talking about it because the police doesn‚Äôt do anything, because he‚Äôs mentally ill, and he said he has 20+ diagnosis and that‚Äôs why he does the thing he does

I always pick an empty bench, preferably without any people near it so I don‚Äôt bother anyone. The benches are often arranged with 2-3 next to each other. Recently families with young kids keep sitting right next to me while I‚Äôm producing clouds capable of swallowing entire towns. Two different mothers have even had the audacity to ask me to move after they sat down AFTER me. Like??? 

It just feels so akward to smoke next to kids, they always be starring at you too. Especially when there‚Äôs other benches free close by like why sit down next to the only stoner in the area? Smoking still feels like something illegal to me since I grew up in a country where it was criminalized, so the fact that parents legit don‚Äôt care is so baffeling to me",hedgybaby,1,1,0.67
224,Seems like I completed (almost) everything and I don't know how to enjoy things,11rzhjb,"PREMISE: I'm not here to flex anything, everything I write it's just to understand me better.

I'm **(27,m**), I finished my studies in **Computer Engineering 4 years ago** and I started working some months before, in IT field. Currenly I'm working as a freelance, earning a decent amount, I have no economic problems at all. I decided this way to be more free in my work.

I have a **house** with low mortgage since 3 years, a city **car**, I also found a **best friend** I can trust, I literally go outside with him everyday in the evening, and we laugh a lot. I even **workout** and have a decent body (can be better, I'm working on it, for myself).

I **should be happy** maybe, I don't know. But everyday it's like filling hours with things, just to pass hours, like they are coping methods.

**I don't have real hobbies**, that I feel like ""yo, X hours passed, so fast, it means I'm enjoying this a lot"", or like there is any kind of progression.

**I don't have objectives** at the moment, it seems like I completed them 4 years ago when I finished my studies and started working. I'm not someone who seeks in being rich, and so trying to have more and more money, I ""enjoy"" little things, just what I need to go out with friends and pay the monthly things, like mortgage.

*My typical day is like*: I workout in the morning in the gym (or it's free day, since I go just 4 days per week), I have the morning meal prepared by me, I start working but I don't concentrate, maybe I finish doing almost nothing the entire day, and the other day I need to rush to recover the work. Maybe I watch videos, reels, chat with online friends, playing 20-30 minutes, to fill that time I'm not working. When it's like 5/6 p.m., my real free time arrives. I don't know how to fill it, so I try to do random things, just to pass time. Dinner time, and after I go out with my friend.

Now there is also a girl, so the example below can fit, but since she broke up recently, I can't do anything properly.

For example: When I find a girl a like, my day is based on that. I can't focus on anything else, I have difficulties also in working, like it's my only objective, and I need to ""develop"" that objective, day per day, instead of living my life, and it should be a ""plus"". If the thing goes ok and we start dating, it's like I'm nullifying my life because it's already complete, and I need to focus on her like, to make her happy (not in a pathological way).

I don't know **how I can enjoy my life** with the things I have, with finding hobbies I really like, and get new objectives, instead of thinking that I completed life.",ontech7,0,1,1.0

226,You will never understand what being fat is like until you actually are,11ro18g,"I've seen a lot of posts and comments that go something like ""I would never be obese, I care too much about how I look in the mirror, and I get uncomfortable being just a little overweight"" or something like that.

The simple fact is, losing weight (especially when you're already obese) is really hard.

I was obese up until last year. I absolutely hated it. I looked myself in the mirror every day and hated my appearance. I had tried to lose weight multiple times but nothing ever worked. It only changed when one day I went to the doctor's and they said I lost 25 pounds, which shocked me, and it motivated me to keep doing what I was doing since I knew it was actually *possible* to lose weight.

And from my experiences with other fat people, I can guarantee you 99% of obese people do not look in the mirror and don't think ""Wow, I'm looking great."" They're equally likely to be self concious. But doing something about it isn't always easy. They could have depression, which makes it hard to do *anything*. They could have an eating disorder. It could be anything. It's not because they just don't care. But losing weight when you're already fat is a difficult and discouraging process.",wt_anonymous,2,5,0.78

228,"OKAY but why am I TA when I don‚Äôt respond to a text from my boss, but when they do the same thing it‚Äôs acceptable???",11rfhdr,"I‚Äôm the first person in at my place of work and procedure for calling out is to call the main office and they will let my manager/supervisor (whichever is in first) know, but to let our manager know as well by shooting her a text or giving a call. She has specifically asked that we not call her cell phone but wait until she‚Äôs in at 8am to call and let her know, but to shoot a text so she has a heads up. I‚Äôm in at 5am and she has kids to get ready for school before work so out of respect and by request I know better than to call her that early in general.

We just got hit with a huge snow storm and I‚Äôm up and out of the house before the plows if I‚Äôm getting to work on time. I drive about an hour to work and my car was all over the road going 10 mph so I turned around and went home, followed correct call out procedures. 

I texted this woman at 5am. It is now 8pm and I haven‚Äôt gotten any response at all to my text so I reach out to ask if she ever got my message. 

IMMEDIATELY hit with:
‚ÄúYea at noon when I went to my grandfathers funeral. I wasn‚Äôt looking at my phone today I was trying to be fully with my family‚Äù 
AS IF I‚Äôm supposed to just know that. As if it‚Äôs not her job to respond at least with an okay or have a supervisor contact me or SOMETHING. Other than just being ignored all day. 

I was out one day a couple weeks ago because my dad took a tumble and needed a ride to the ER. He‚Äôs 74, so of course I went and waited with him. I was texted about every other hour to be questioned on what‚Äôs happening and when will I be in, even well after my shift (5am-1pm) had ended. And it was all false concern about my dad when she was really just needling to find out if I‚Äôll be in or not. 

I get it, I do, to an extent. Yes it‚Äôs an inconvenience at the moment and a concern for management would be to find coverage but when I get hit with a message like that trying to make me feel like my problems aren‚Äôt shit I get fucking irritated. I‚Äôve seen countless people call out for bullshit reasons, hell no call no show and still have a job and NOT be pestered all day by the manager, but when it‚Äôs someone who actually shows up and takes pride in their work we are berated.

I then read the bill. I quickly realize that the title and explanation of the internet posts were misleading. 90% of the people in the discussion comments ignore this. They even argue with the people pointing out that this information is misleading or quickly redirect the subject to be about how someone else is wrong in some way. 

I'm pretty progressive. I see a lot of progressive circles doing this. It pissed me off because while we share the same goals, they're screwing it up by making us look bad and creating useless noise. 

It's counterproductive to blatantly ignore the reality of whatever bill is being discussed. One can still push back against a bill without exageration. It would probably be more useful to actually discuss the truth of the bill, rather than elicit fear-mongering. It ends up making the people who oppose the bill look like fear-mongering, truth-denying, strawmanning idiots. Just steelman instead.",kleenexhyacinth,1,4,0.83

248,It isn't for you to judge who's worthy of a handicap tag,11r8q9f,"Unless it's your job to evaluate people and/or assign them handicap placards, shut *up* about who's worthy of a tag. Absolutely try your hand at calling parking enforcement regarding someone that's taking up a handicap spot that doesn't have a tag or placard, but respectfully, *fuck you* if you judge someone for using the authorization that they have. 

There are enough entitled assholes in the world - do not add yourself to their number. Not all disabilities are visible. Not all disabilities, visible or not, require special treatment. Not all people with a disability will *want* special consideration, and not all people will consider their disability in the eyes of others to *be* a disability. Not all people with an authorization to use a handicap parking spot will use one all the time. If you *do* have a placard and are calling someone else out for using the spot you wanted, and they *also* have a placard, *shut your mouth* to give yourself a little extra time to think before you start judging someone in the same way that you're judged. 

I was called some rather colorful names earlier for parking in a handicap spot at a doctor's appointment. We have a placard. This lady also had a placard, and didn't notice that there was a spot open right next to me. She was butthurt about walking all the way across the parking lot, and while that sucks, that's not my problem. I get that she was probably dealing with the same frustration that we do, in watching people *without* a placard just take up a spot that they shouldn't be using just because they don't want to walk a few extra feet, but had she given herself a little time to think she'd have been able to bring some critical thinking skills to the fore and maybe not make an ass of herself by screaming a blue streak across a doctor's parking lot.

249,"Why I think battery EVs or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are not the future, but hydrogen internal combustion engines (disclaimer: this is one long but hopefully interesting post).",11rd6ta,"Internal combustion engines (ICE) are not new and we have long been using them in our vehicles such as cars for years if not decades and this is a technology that we mankind, have huge expertise and experience in but when the topic of ""what is the long-term solution for transportation"" arrives, it's mainly the argument between BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) vs HFCVs (Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles) but many people are either not aware of hydrogen being able to run on our current ICE that powers billions of our cars around the globe from developing to developed countries or, they are aware of it but are put off by the inefficiency or simply due to the fact that there is basically no hydrogen ICE vehicle on market today (unlike Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, as there are a few like Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo that are sold in selective markets with slow but growing hydrogen infrastructure).

First, let's tackle hydrogen vs BEVs, I will keep this simple because *some* of this has already been discussed on this subreddit itself. Hydrogen helps us not be dependent on limited resources like lithium, which also required mining, and mining ALSO has huge ecological side effects, this is an issue despite BEVs being the number 1 tech to have the highest efficiency. Something not so often discussed? I come from India, and I will tell you that developing countries like mine, have a hard time accessing stable consistent power supplies for homes themselves. As far as I know, in both Europe and countries like the US, the term ""power cut"" is not something that is often worried about unless due to a natural disaster, in my country, powers cuts are way more common without natural disasters and to put it nicely, BEVs simply does not make sense for every part of the world.

Now let's move to Hydrogen fuel cell vs combustion tech. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, for those who are knowledgeable in this topic, would know that it is often called ""simply better"" than hydrogen's use on ICE because after BEVs, hydrogen fuel cell tech is pretty efficient compared to hydrogen ICE which is unfortunately and probably the most inefficient tech we are talking about in this post. Then why hydrogen on ICE?

* Lack of dependence on rare or limited resources: For example, mass-produced fuel cells that are used today use metals such as platinum, ruthenium and etc. While researchers have experimented with trying to replace rare metals like platinum with different and perhaps more common resources, it's still very much in experimental stages and I am only saying that for only a few components like platinum, other components like ruthenium don't have complete replacements in research-level yet. It should also be understood that research being done in a university for example as an experiment replacing a rare material like platinum won't end up being mass-produced in real-world applications anytime soon, also considering how HFCVs receive less than half of the billions of investments BEVs are getting these days. But when it comes to hydrogen on ICE, the internal combustion engine on your gas car doesn't really use any ""rare"" resources or metals, the same goes for hydrogen ICE!
* Scaling production: This is huge, automakers need to revamp production facilities and etc to make these battery or hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles, which makes it a much bigger, longer, and more difficult transition/move long-term globally, maybe even unrealistic, but hydrogen on ICE is technically and relatively much easier. I mean despite the electric hype, billions of cars on road still use petrol-powered ICE and EVs still account for a very small percentage minority of the whole automotive sales pie. And hydrogen on ICE is not as different as gasoline on ICE, the tank changes, the fuel source changes from petrol, and with some small modifications to the ICE, we can literally keep many existing factories from automakers that have been pumping these ICE-powered vehicles for decades, the only obstacle in my eyes is the infrastructure which is growing, but it is pretty slow and you are limited to countries like UK or states like California.
* Retrofitting/conversions: I mean, this is a no-brainer, if we really do explore and possibly (or hopefully!) adapt hydrogen combustion/ICE as the long-term solution, it would be way, WAY easier to retrofit/convert an existing gas car with an ICE to a Hydrogen car with an ICE, much easier than the conversions you see online that make gas cars electric but such BEV conversions are way more expensive and unrealistic for the public. Same goes for hydrogen fuel cells, so is it really a good idea to adapt these technologies instead when we already have so many ICE vehicles on-road? What, will we scrap them for climate change?
* Cars staying as real cars (applies for motorbikes too): This is especially for car enthusiasts like myself. Hydrogen on ICE is a dream come true for us, I mean you might have already heard this somewhere else but the sound, the vibrations of these sports cars will survive thanks to hydrogen. Heck, MANUAL STICK SHIFTS WILL SURIVIVE, not one of those fake manual simulators on battery-powered EVs.

Now about how inefficient hydrogen on ICE is, I would like to mention that the use of hydrogen on ICE as a whole tech is still very immature and lacks the years and money of development on fuel cells or most importantly, battery electric vehicles received. The early electric cars sucked too, they barely had any range, charging was a bigger pain, and a lot fewer options to choose from but look at where they are now. I think the same optimism needs to exist if we are to make use of other alternative technologies such as Hydrogen on ICE. Toyota (a great example here) has silently been developing and investing as one of the few automakers on hydrogen (both fuel cells and hydrogen ICE) and probably the only one for hydrogen ICE with its Toyota corolla prototype that it has raced on several occasions and try to make use of motorsport as the testbed.

[Toyota was also able to make several improvements to its hydrogen ICE-powered](https://pressroom.toyota.com/the-familiarity-of-sound-sensation-without-all-of-the-carbon-toyota-refines-its-hydrogen-engine-corolla-concept/)[ Toyota Corolla race car, here are their statements;](https://pressroom.toyota.com/the-familiarity-of-sound-sensation-without-all-of-the-carbon-toyota-refines-its-hydrogen-engine-corolla-concept/)

>Some of the improvements of the special turbocharged hydrogen engine include enhancing power output to a level equivalent to that of a gasoline engine through engine calibration; changing the refueling location to include both sides of the vehicle to allow for quicker fill times during races; and shaving off an additional 88 pounds from the overall vehicle weight.

&#x200B;

>One key point was that we reduced the refueling time from an initial five minutes at the Fuji 24-hour in April by 40 percent to about three minutes in Autopolis, and then again to about two minutes (at Suzuka), or a 60 percent improvement, in just three races

This shows how development can improve technologies that were once probably not as good and I often see in the general internet from hardcore EV and tech fans trashing hydrogen (Elon calling them ""fool cells"" certainly didn't help) but while electric cars are better than gas vehices in many aspects today, they were not before/back then, so this really should not be a reason to put a full stop on hydrogen because development and improvements takes time and efforts from us. It does not make sense to throw the towel and stick with ""the future is electric"" just because another tesla fanboy said so (no offense), what we do today will impact the future, we make the future.

**My personal message to automakers** around the globe if they ever see this post (probably .0001% chance):

**Stop investing in the BEV hype, stop investing in hydrogen fuel cells, start investing in hydrogen infrastructure, you people already have the internal combustion engine on your gas vehicles that you have been selling for decades, it's extremely easy to switch them to hydrogen from petrol, you know it, rather than switching to fuel cells or batteries as a whole, just use your damn money to improve the hydrogen infrastructure, if all automakers do this, we can tackle climate change (which is why we are even considering alternative technologies) possibly even sooner. People won't lose their jobs in the automotive inudstry. Heck, as a hardcore car enthusiast, sensational cars may continue to live well thanks to hydrogen too.**

There is no setting or options in the app to set a new password. There is no options to even troubleshoot issues with your account.

I have had to, every month, delete my account from the app, clear the cache, and readd my account otherwise it will not work.

The only real solution would be for Microsoft to get their heads out of their butts and let me change the password manually. But I don't think that will happen.

I had a phase when I was insecure about my intelligence, and there was this time when I made a bumbling fool out of myself for (when attempting to put a plastic sealing clip on coffee bag.) It's very simple but the design of the item threw me off, and I ended up overthinking it. 

My parents were trying to comfort me about this, one evening, and they were successful (we had a good laugh) until I went deeper into details and how it lasted for 5 mins (I was still feeling down) and then dad mumbled in laugh  ""oh, please don't tell me that"". 

I confronted them about this once, and they told me this was supposed to be a joke. However, when I think about this again..I don't get what is supposed to be funny in that sentence? Where's the catch? 

It sounds to me like a dissapointment you couldn't hide. With that saying, he basically undo all the comforting part because it all turned out to be fake in my eyes..

287,My ‚Äúfriend‚Äù blocked me on every social media platform I have over a meme,11qv8hb,"Hi, my name is D√©Vant√© (26M). I‚Äôve been having issues with my friend Hans (28M) who I thought of as a close friend. Things have just been an absolute mess between us for the past couple of weeks. The main issues that I have with Hans are that he‚Äôs emotionally abusive, dismissive of my feelings, and  has constantly tried to paint me out to be a villain in almost every situation lately. I feel like he‚Äôs consistently been projecting his own issues and insecurities onto me. I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôm perfect in any way. I acknowledge my flaws and know there are things about myself I can improve on, but I‚Äôve always tried to do my best when it comes to considering him because I do care about him. On the other hand he‚Äôs been treating me like he doesn‚Äôt give a damn about me. If my opinion isn‚Äôt what he wants to hear he dismisses it. If I voice my emotions he says that I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo emotional‚Äù, ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù, multiple variations of the word angry etc. Not to mention he says that I act ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù to him when I‚Äôve never once thought that I was better than anyone on this Earth and it‚Äôs not in my character to treat people that way. (If I‚Äôm being honest it lowkey feels like he‚Äôs jealous or intimidated by me in some way)

I remember a few weeks ago I just told Hans that I just wanted him to treat me as though we‚Äôre equals  and that I don‚Äôt treat my friends as if they‚Äôre lower than me because I view them as being on the exact same level I am. His response was ‚Äúfriends don‚Äôt think of each other as equal. That‚Äôs the biggest lie I‚Äôve ever heard. I could only treat you as equal say if we both worked the same position at a job, but we don‚Äôt so I can‚Äôt do that‚Äù (I know looking back on it it sounds embarrassing and toxic on his end that I was pretty much asking him to give me the bare minimum and looking back on it should‚Äôve never had to do that)

Last Thursday is when things got really bad. Once again Hans started an argument with me and I got tired of being verbally abused so I explained to him that I was sick of his shit and that if he wasn‚Äôt going to treat me like he appreciated me that I didn‚Äôt have to deal with it and I wouldn‚Äôt be his friend anymore. 

I didn‚Äôt hear from him at this point but he still had me on social media so I assumed he would calm down and that we would just talk another day. Yesterday I posted a meme that had nothing to do with him on my Instagram story and I guess he saw it and proceeded to block me on every social media I have (and I mean EVERYTHING including an old Instagram connected to my current account that I don‚Äôt even use anymore). Instead of just sliding up on my story and asking ‚ÄúIs this about me?‚Äù he jumped to conclusions and just decided to basically erase me out of his life over it

I wouldn‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm angry about how things went down because his behaviors were incredibly toxic, I didn‚Äôt want to deal with them anymore and this was probably a sign that he doesn‚Äôt need to be in my life but I am hurt. It‚Äôs just insane to me that an almost thirty year old man lacks accountability and is so immature that he‚Äôs not willing to accept his own faults and would gladly abandon a friendship over being wrong.

Part of me wants to reach out to try to make things right if he unblocks me but the other just wants to say ‚Äúfuck it, it is what it is and he never deserved a friend like me in the first place‚Äù and act like he doesn‚Äôt exist

I saw a post on a sub a few weeks ago about a plane crash where a pilot let his children in the cockpit and let them play around and pretend to fly the plane. Long story short, one kid pulled too hard on the yolk and disengaged autopilot. Neither pilot realized and failed to get the plane back under control.The plane crashed. There were so many people in the comments saying the kids were stupid and should have been aborted/never born and that they were dumbasses. They were KIDS! It‚Äôs the fault of the dumbass pilots who they put their trust in who were supposed to be smart enough not to let a kid play around in a cockpit. But bc of reddits weird fucking hate boner for kids, everyone was blaming two children for their own deaths!

I was on Instagram and there was a video of a woman at a trampoline place and she was doing some flips and a small toddler accidentally walked in front of her and got hit. Instead of blaming the parents for letting a TODDLER (he was likely no older than two) roam around out of their sight, there were so many people saying the kid was stupid and deserved it and should have been aware of his surroundings! He‚Äôs a toddler! And then there were people who said they kept watching it over and over bc they enjoyed watching a ‚Äústupid fucking kid‚Äù getting hurt repeatedly. That is lunatic behavior!

298,"""Why do you run away when I enter the room?""",11qphnw,"My father asked this. For several years now I have been purposefully avoiding him. I isolate myself in my bedroom to avoid him. If I hear him in the living room or kitchen I will skip meals and just sleep for the whole day to just avoid having to interact with him. I hate my father. He was never a parent to me, he never raised me, and he has anger issues and is a racist, bigot, misogynistic - he's literally everything I hate. And I'm also everything that he hates. I'm progressive with all my views, I'm a lesbian and questioning my gender, and I wore my mask the entire pandemic and still do when in heavily populated areas. But he doesn't know all this, because I hide it from him, because I know he would either kick me out of the house or hurt me if he knew. He may have never laid a hand on me, but he has beaten my brother, so I know he's capable of hurting me, too. 

Recently he was just really rude to me. I planned on eating the leftover pizza, he saw my plate, and then proceeded to call me greedy four separate times, raised his voice, and got angry despite me offering some of the pizza to him. Then he left and slammed the door. It wasn't even an argument, it was just him getting angry in less than a minute, then leaving. It escalated faster than I knew how to stop it, and it made me scared when I had my father towering over me, getting in my face and acting angry. I cried for over an hour afterward. 

I don't know why this specific situation made me snap, but it did. I am just so tired of my father. I'm tired of him taking out his unresolved trauma and anger on me the moment I do something he doesn't like, and I'm tired of putting in all the work in my own therapy to be a better person, but he's allowed to be an asshole and continue hurting me. Why am I responsible for dealing with daddy issues when he's the one that did this to me? 

I blocked his number and blocked him on Facebook, even though I never texted or interacted with him anyway. But it still felt good to do, because I don't want him to have any access to me at any point in time. Then I started making my avoidance of him obvious. In the past, I avoided him if possible, but if I failed I would just stay quiet and try not to engage if I saw him. Nope, not this time. As soon as he walks into the room, I get up from the couch and blatantly leave the room. This made him angry, of course. He acts like he is entitled to me as his daughter, and he only cares to say something when I'm openly defiant. ""Why do you leave every time I enter a room?"" and ""you don't have to do that. Are you always going to be this way?"" They're all spoken with frustration and anger, but I'm not going to talk to him and try to sort this out. I've done my years of therapy and medication and self reflection, I'm not doing the work to fix our relationship when I don't even want to and he won't even try. 

And what am I supposed to tell him? I know he's not stupid. Surely, he knows that I hate him. I've not made it subtle. I stopped calling him dad and only refer to him as father years ago. I never talk with him, and when I do, it's short and curt. I saw him maybe once a week before I started to actively avoid him, and now I engage with him even less. I openly argue with and push back against any bigoted or racist remarks he makes. Every time we engage, it's neutral or negative. I'm never pleased or happy when around him. He must know why. And yet, he still asks. 

I don't know what kind of answer he wants. 

I'm not going to openly tell him I hate him. I'm not stupid, either. I'm not putting myself in potential danger. I do all this because I don't have to directly face my father. I'm not spitting in his face, so he can't directly challenge me, and he can't accuse me of anything. I know I stand no chance against him physically, and I'm under no delusions that my mother would have enough of a backbone to support me in a verbal fight against him. 

So, I'm stuck in a limbo. I'm going to keep avoiding him. I'm going to keep hating him. I'm never going to be brave enough to say it to his face. And I guess I'm going to keep doing all this until it blows up in my face. My only solace is he probably doesn't care enough to try to confront or have a serious talk with me, so maybe I'll be left alone for the rest of my life. One can only hope.",random-shit-writing,4,3,0.81

i get this is expected from most companies but it‚Äôs still so frustrating and difficult 
i‚Äôm a university student, limiting me to casual work only, i can‚Äôt get myself on a contract. 
i started off strong being given minimum 26 hours a week, up to 34, and i was thriving. 
however as time has gone on, the owners of the company have decided they want to spend less money on employees, and i mean way less. they‚Äôre cutting back rosters to no end, leaving not just me, but everyone else, with barely any hours weekly. and on top of that, they‚Äôre currently conducting job interviews to hire MORE staffs (specifically 15 and 16 years olds who are so much cheaper to pay) and leaving people like me to pick up the scraps 

i‚Äôve been working here for a year and i am arguably the hardest worker they have. i haven‚Äôt slacked off, ever. i put in 110% every shift and go above and beyond for this company that doesn‚Äôt care or take notice. they would rather roster on teenagers who slack off all day, and generate too many customer complaints, simply because it‚Äôll save them a few dollars. 

i‚Äôm an adult, i have things to pay for, i have bills and groceries and petrol, and 8 hours a week is not enough to cover anything.

I'm not going to explain the ""reasons"" for personal and privacy reasons, but just know that it needs to be addressed and soon and this is just my rant. I'm not really looking for advice, just a place to rant.

My principal needs to observe one of my classes and have a conference for reasons and I named 5 or 6 dates and times that would work for me and asked her to get back to me if none of them were convenient for her. It took a week to hear back from her. During this week, I offered to go to meet her in her office to discuss times and dates and to further discuss the reason for meeting, but she's always busy and according to the VP, rarely in her office. She's also a site coordinator in the education program at the local college (she works once a week with soon-to-be teachers) so I know she's busy and I'm trying to respect that.

But when I heard from her a week after my time/date email, she asked for my phone number, which I included in my original email. I gave it to her again and 8 days later, she emailed me that she forgot to call. I visited her office, was told she wasn't in, and left a note. Another week passes. She emails to apologize and asks for my number again and says she'll call 2 days ago (yes, Saturday, I know its stupid) at a time that would not work because of my job. I told her ok, asked my boss for a short break to answer the call and was all set. She never called! I had an email when I got home saying she had to move the phone call to a different time but I didn't get that email (or call that she was supposed to make) because she sent it while I was at work (where there is a no-phone policy). 

The semester is almost halfway done and the reason she needs to observe and conference is going to be long done and over with if I don't get her into my classroom soon.

302,"It is so cringe when someone claim that their ""gut feeling"" or instinct is always correct.",11q7xze,"I am certain that most people who claim that their gut feeling is always right are just experiencing confirmation bias. When their gut feeling is wrong, they tend to forget about it, but when it's right, they remember it and bring it up as proof of their predictive instinct. It's even more annoying when they believe they can't be wrong, and even when all evidence contradicts their gut feeling, they assume someone is lying to them and that proof has not yet arisen.

I know a person like this, and the most annoying thing is that they think they are Sherlock Holmes, picking up small things about a person and drawing conclusions about them. I feel embarrassed for them when their predictions are way off, but they are still so confident about it. When the person they are analyzing tells them it's wrong, they will just say that the person is in denial.",MeawingDuckss,7,16,0.78

309,I am done with gaming. Am i the only one who feels like this?,11qgqe9,"I have multiple reasons. 

1. Money. It‚Äôs all about money nowadays. How can they possibly get us to pay them the most for the littlest  bits of nontent. Look at EA. With their ridiculously expensive sims packs. Releasing the same content as dlc for each of their games. Sims 2 pets as dlc, surely sims 3 and 4 will have them in the base games? Nope. Dlc in those as well. Or how about locking the ending to your story in a 40 dollar dlc? Looking at you ubisoft. Not to mention micro transactions for online modes, that also take up all of the company‚Äôs attention, leaving the single player to rot without any new content. Looking at you rockstar, with your precious gta online. 

2. Deep life experiences. Games nowadays need to have deep, meaningful stories. Games even refer to themselves as ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù instead of games. I liked this when it was new, but i am missing games that were just that. Games. A simple shooter, a simple beat em up, a game where you play as a cheerleader and you kill zombies with a chainsaw. Great fun. Now it must all be serious, deep and meaningful, like the last of us, red dead 2, and countless of others. 

3. Realism. Realism will be the death of video games. Especially when the developers favor realism over fun. Like in red dead 2. Where witnesses spawn out of nowhere, in the middle of nowhere, run for 20 steps and magically get the law on you. Soo realistic! Not. I am all for realistic graphics, animations and the like. But not if it sacrifices fun. 

4. Broken promises and delays. How often do we see an e3 demo, and the game looks absolutely gorgeous, just for the finalized product to be a downgraded, empty shell of what was promised to us. It‚Äôs a scam. Nothing more. Who could forget the lies the developers of no man‚Äôs sky spread, only for their finalized product to be an empty, soulless product. Sure it‚Äôs better now, but it‚Äôs too little too late for me. And not to mention delays. Especially when the current gen versions are already on the shelves, but the last gen people are forced to wait for month after month, delay after delay. And for what? A product that is undeniably going to be inferior to the current gen counterparts. Like cyberpunk, it will have longer loading times, fewer npc‚Äôs, worse graphics, worse fps drops. And yet these companies expect their consumers to pay full price for an inferior version of their game after being forced to wait way longer than others. I find these practices absolutely unprofessional and unacceptable. 

Gaming has gone from a fun pastime, to an overpriced luxurious accommodation. 
Where only the rich are able to pay for the full package and get the full ‚Äúexperience.‚Äù The base game for the sims 4 might me free, but that‚Äôs only because it is devoid of content. If you want the full experience, that will only cost you a little over 1000 dollars. For a video game. I am disgusted at what this industry has become. A capitalistic industry, designed to get as much money from you as humanly possible, while at the same time delivering as little content as possible, with as little effort put in as possible. Developers will screw you over where ever and whenever they can, because the player does not matter, only the player‚Äôs money does. 

And I for one am absolutely done with it. I haven‚Äôt bought a new game in a long time, there was one new game I wanted, but I have decided to forget about that one too. At 26 I have achieved precious little in my life. All the while I was wasting away with one game or another. No longer. I am done. It‚Äôs sad it has to end like this. But I am absolutely done with this disgusting, money hungry industry.",CIassicNegan,5,3,0.71

314,We progressives are not recognizing how our strategies to combat systemic discrimination and harm is actually driving conservatives further into their ideological extremism,11q4krr,"While we need *progressives* (as opposed to ‚Äúradicals‚Äù), culture is a yin-yang of our conservatives and progressives. The loss of either would put society in peril. The moral foundations of progressives and conservatives is a mechanism written into our psychology. We are literally born with a blueprint of our moral ideology that we revise over the course of our lives. 

The problem is in our tribalism and not recognizing the symbiotic relationship in a society of people where half advocates for growth and the other half advocates for temperance. 

When one group vilifies the other, we egg the backfire effect and polarize our society. 

We all know the mistakes that conservatives are making in society at the moment. Facebook is an echo chamber of conservative failing layer to bear. 

The thing that scares me is that progressives are suppose to be leaders of change. Cultivators. Shepherds of change. We  aren‚Äôt recognizing that our own actions are egging the right and pushing them harder right. The quickest way to get someone to stop listening to you is to yell at them. 

The righteous echo chamber of social media and the availability cascade of negative media has assured that we are justified in our moral retribution. We are caught up in our anger and frustration that we feel justified dolling our social shaming as a means, we hope to get people to conform away from systemic failings and narrow-minded views. Our knee jerk response is to punish those who perpetuate systemic harm that they were born into, as if the ship can be turned faster if we just push harder.

We need more compassion, and patience give people the space they need to grow. 

I am not saying that we need tolerate discrimination nor hate but we need to give people the space and patience to recognize their mistakes without fear that they will be never forgiven or to be defined by them for the rest of their lives. 

Literally the *science* of how minds change for the better. The best available research tells us that patience, compassion and cultivating curiosity are all essential components to combating discrimination and harm.

337,"People think I'm ""acting tough"" because I walk with my chest out and stand straight",11pxlec,"I'm back in the gym and stronger than I've ever been, I made a lot of gains and my posture has improved a ton also.

Is it somehow now a bad thing for me to be walking with my chest out?

I was told I have broad shoulders but I also have a bad habit of letting my arms hang too far from my body sometimes ""Like people who pretend to have bigger lats than they do""

But today I was walking and some douche with his girl was behind me and started laughing and making jokes mocking me behind my back, saying ""Oh look at that, he thinks he's a tough guy, with his chest out and walking tall.""

It actually offended me and I turned around and looked right at them, they shut up pretty quickly and didn't say anything, but honestly I just found that a bit offensive so I had to look back at them in an aggressive way.

But please don't confuse this with me being an aggressive person all the time, I'm a nice person but when people are disrespectful to me for no reason at all, simply for just walking how I normally walk, it is annoying.

What annoyed me most is he was implying I was weak and not tough at all, but I've spent most of my late teens and 20's training MMA to stop being a victim to bullying and to defend myself in the rough area I grew up in and I go to the gym constantly, so I know for a fact I'm not weak or a wanna-be tough guy, I worked too hard to get to where I am.

So my question is how am I supposed to be walking??? I am wondering how if my body language comes off as aggressive or like a ""wannabe tough guy"". If my body language does come off as aggressive I would definitely want to work on that and fix it since it isn't my intention, I'd prefer to walk around this world having people be friendly to me and in turn I can more easily be open and friendly to them...",Symbolicalism,4,4,0.83

I told him I couldn't check them or cash them out because they were out of state. He asked why he couldn't just check them. I explained to him that it's because those tickets he had weren't in the Pennsylvania lottery system. Now, what do you think happens as soon as I turn my back? The guy scans the tickets. The next thing I know, my ticket scanner is beeping like crazy and has all these error codes coming up. I turned around and asked him, ""What did you do? ""I scanned the tickets. I want to check them."" He didn't listen to a single word I told him. Now, my only lottery checker is down for the rest of the day because I can't get the error to go away.

E would try to isolate me and not let me have any friends and he would verbally abuse me, he tried to strangle me and almost broke my hand. Used  - soup of slide - against me and self hooom.  He would also talk about his ex constantly like he was still in love with her.

347,Lazy ex getting everything I want,11pypgx,"Obligatory warning that there‚Äôs a lot of pieces to this so it might be very jumbled.

My ex (now m18) and I (now f18) started dating at the end of 7th grade, and broke up halfway through sophomore year (two days before my birthday üòí). So about 2 1/2 years. Throughout the relationship, he never wanted to spend time with me. He was always too nervous to hang out with me around my family, but hardly ever wanted me to come to his house either. He never wanted to call, and would pretty much ignore me when we did to play video games with his brother. He stood me up on the Fourth of July, and granted I was grounded so he couldn‚Äôt contact me to change plans, but my parents were sympathetic and let me use my phone that night, and he hadn‚Äôt texted at all. I asked what the hell happened and he basically said he got too nervous. He pulled that sort of thing at least two more times over the course of the relationship. We argued a lot over that, and he‚Äôd always make promises to change and never would. Once, I sent him a long paragraph about how he never puts effort into anything, and he felt bad and promised me that he would learn to put more effort into stuff, and never did. I put up with so much. So essentially, the relationship was sucky.

During our relationship though, I found music, and decided that I want to pursue it as a career. It‚Äôs my biggest passion in life and tbh I think I‚Äôm pretty good at it. But soon after I found it, he found it too, and decided the same thing. So part of my anger in this whole situation is that it was mine first.

The main part of this though is that he doesn‚Äôt work on anything BUT music. He has a horrible GPA (last I knew at least, but I‚Äôm sure it hasn‚Äôt changed), no job, can‚Äôt get his license because he has panic attacks when he gets behind the wheel (I know I shouldn‚Äôt be judgmental of this part because he did have a bad car accident when he was younger. I guess I just associate it with all the excuses about being too anxious to hang out with me that he never pushed against at all. So just take this for what you will), and he‚Äôs honestly very emotionally immature (as evidenced by my junior year when he apologized for everything, which I was grateful for and genuinely wanted to be friends, but he couldn‚Äôt accept that and kept trying to get me to break up with my now bf to get back with him).

So there‚Äôs all that. Jump to this year, senior year. The talent show was 4 days ago, and he and his band won. I ended up not even competing because of all the homework I have, but I‚Äôm somewhat glad now because I know I would‚Äôve lost to them and that would be a hard punch to the ego. But this has just been driving me insane. Every year that they‚Äôve announced that the talent show is coming up, I start getting crazy anxious. I‚Äôm in constant competition with him and he doesn‚Äôt even know it. I‚Äôm terrified that he‚Äôs better than me at music. If he is, it‚Äôs only because he REFUSES to do anything that he doesn‚Äôt want to do, while I‚Äôm juggling high school (trying to graduate salutatorian), a college class, an EMT class, and my job as a manager for the local movie theater. I don‚Äôt have the time to practice, and now he‚Äôs being rewarded for doing like %5 of what I do with everything I want. It‚Äôs driving me insane.

Idk what I expect to hear, anything is welcome. Thanks for reading :)

TL/DR: My shitty ex refuses to do anything except work on music, while I‚Äôm juggling responsibilities and have no time to practice. As a result, he won the talent show and I didn‚Äôt even end up competing because of lack of time, and I feel as though he‚Äôs getting everything I‚Äôve ever wanted as reward for being lazy.",Ok_Writing_6042,0,1,1.0

352,My Struggle,11pnp4k,"I am a 29 year old man in the US on disability benefits who lives with his parents. The following is from my personal journal:

""I learned the hard way that I cannot stalk my way into being a woman's boyfriend, fianc√©, or husband - it will never happen and I'm done with that. I'm done with trying to be someone I'm not. I'm asocial, and I have been that way for a long time, for as long as I've had discernible mental illness. That's just how I am. If I had the power to become a ""normal"" person, with real two-way friendships and intimate¬†partnerships, I would have made that choice in a heartbeat, but I can't, and no psychiatric drug can fix me (and I have tried over 10 different ones including Lithium, Lamictal, Depakote, Carbamazepine, Topimirate, Saphris, Risperidone, Invega, Haldol, Latuda, and more). The initial and true reason I went on psychiatric drugs was not for primary symptoms of mental illness like mania or depression (even though when I went to my first psychiatrist I said that was the reason). The true reason was to try and change my personality and get a girlfriend, and it never worked. Before I developed mental illness (not including childhood ADHD), when I was about 12 or 13 years old, there was this girl named Cathy who I used to eat lunch with each day in an outdoor area behind my school, just the two of us, but then I developed my initial mental illness and changed and things didn't work out with us (in high school I wanted to go with her to the prom, but when I asked her to join me on my regular walk on the beach she said that she was ""not interested, never interested"", which I still vaguely remember over 10 years later because it fucking hurt. I ultimately ended up going to the prom alone after multiple other rejections). After I graduated from that school, I wanted to use psychiatric medication to fix me to make things work out interpersonal relationship wise in the future, but it never worked. Cathy blocked me for stalking/harassment (about four years ago with another Facebook account I used to go around her block I apologized to her and reminded her of us by showing her this photo of what she wrote in my middle school yearbook which you can see at https://i.ibb.co/jMp3wdv/Cathy.png , but then she blocked that Facebook account too), and this same sort of thing repeated itself with many other women who I also felt I had fallen in love with after her. Cathy has since gotten married (from my second Facebook account I saw a profile photo of hers where a man was proposing to her), but my experience with her was one of the most emotionally painful and formative experiences of my life (I still to this day have a small teddy bear holding a heart that says ""Love"" on it which she gave me on Valentine's Day when I was maybe 13 years old) and what happened set my future objectives in life. I wanted to correct what happened, but maybe with another woman. I had dreams of marriage and I wanted one day to have children with a woman who I fell in love with (sometimes when I fall in love with a woman I imagine in the future us having a child together), but I don't see either marriage or children ever happening for me.

357,"As an artist, I am fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence and its impact on the world of art. However, I also have some concerns and frustrations with the current state of AI in the art world.",11pf9op,"Firstly, I worry about the devaluation of human creativity and talent. With AI becoming more advanced, it's possible that some people may view it as a replacement for human artists. While AI can certainly produce impressive works of art, it lacks the depth and emotional connection that comes from human creativity. Art is a reflection of the human experience, and it's important to recognize the value of human creativity and expression.

Secondly, I am concerned about the potential for AI to perpetuate biases and reinforce existing societal inequalities. AI algorithms are only as objective as the data they are trained on, and if that data reflects societal biases, then the AI will replicate those biases in its output. This is already happening in fields such as facial recognition, where AI has been found to be less accurate for people with darker skin tones. As an artist, it's important to be aware of these biases and to work towards creating more inclusive and equitable art.

Furthermore, the rise of AI-generated art raises questions about authorship and ownership. If an AI creates a work of art, who owns the copyright? Is it the creator of the AI algorithm or the person who owns the AI? These questions will become increasingly important as AI-generated art becomes more prevalent, and it's important for artists to advocate for their rights and ensure that they are properly credited and compensated for their work.

Finally, as an artist, I am frustrated by the idea that AI can replace the human element of art. Art is more than just a technical skill, it's about emotion, passion, and connection. While AI can certainly produce impressive works, it lacks the ability to connect with audiences on a deeper level. It's important for artists to continue to push the boundaries of their craft and to embrace the unique perspectives and experiences that only humans can provide.

In conclusion, while I am excited about the potential of artificial intelligence in the art world, I believe that it's important to recognize and value the human element of art. As artists, we must continue to create works that reflect our unique perspectives and experiences, while also being aware of the potential biases and ethical concerns that come with AI-generated art. By embracing both human creativity and technological innovation, we can create a more vibrant and inclusive art world.",oooooooooooh12,2,5,1.0

To me unless someone is doing something that harms you or anyone else, dangerous, illegal etc there‚Äôs no need to be judgemental or rude in the name of opinions. Demeaning or discouraging another person is not an opinion!

Being snarky is now considered cool almost or it‚Äôs just edgy to be mean!

I had one teacher who was my mentor and I would probably be in a ditch without her. She convinced me to go to college and in college everything turned around. I went to therapy the college offered and worked past my anxiety. I was having amazing regular sex with sexy ass college boys every weekend. I had a dope group of friends that I had fun with constantly.

In that time I was sexually assaulted, my best friend stole/broke around a grand worth of stuff from me and trashed the room she was renting in my apartment, I had to move because the increased my rent then had to move again because the new place increased my rent again.

Now after graduating I got lucky and I have a good job and can support myself without a roommate. I can go out to eat whenever I want whenever I want. I am taking my first vacation since college this week to NYC. But I am just so so so unhappy. 

Fuck covid, fuck capitalism, fuck liars, fuck thief's. I'm only 22 and I'm so tired of the world. 

Everything was so much more simple when I was in college.

I haven't had sex in over a year because when I try all I can think about is my assault. I have no friends anymore. The past two months other than walking my dog I've left my house twice.

I know I've fallen into unhealthy habits but I just feel like I'm drowning. I just want to go back to stressing over assignments and fucking around with my friends.

End rant.

So for some background information on what compelled me to write this, I was at the mall and a group of teen girls, probably between the ages of 13 and 16 were mocking a black girl and her friend, calling them racial slurs loudly. No idea what the background story was but I felt so bad for these girls and nobody else was saying anything, so I step in and I say ‚ÄúYou know what? If I was a mother to any of you? I would be DISGUSTED to see my child behaving this way and treating people like this in public.‚Äù 

After comforting the bullied girls, they thanked me and took the bus home. I then get into it with these racist little mean girls, keep in mind i‚Äôm not necessarily ‚Äúold‚Äù I just turned 20 and i‚Äôm female, if that matters. 

These are the main excuses I hear out of their mouths, on top of a bunch of poor insults and random swearing: 

- ‚Äúnot a grown woman arguing with a MINOR..‚Äù 

- ‚Äúat your ancient age..‚Äù 

- ‚Äúim a minor so whatever‚Äù 

- ‚Äúim literally a child omg‚Äù

But I went home for Christmas break for 3 weeks and when I returned she has been so cold towards me for literally no reason. I tried asking if something happened or if I upset her and she claims nothings wrong but then just completely ignores me. I get sometimes you don‚Äôt wanna talk but you don‚Äôt just straight up ignore people as if they‚Äôd rent there, especially when they‚Äôre asking you a question about the room. We have not spoken in two months.

Not only that but she is so inconsiderate. She acts like she lives alone or that I‚Äôm just a maid. I‚Äôm constantly cleaning up after her. I don‚Äôt mind doing a deep clean once a week, but I‚Äôm having to clean up after her every day. It‚Äôs not like I can‚Äôt just leave the mess, we share the space and I don‚Äôt want live in filth. For example, I cleaned the bathroom last Saturday. Including yeh shower. Now I had showered that morning so after cleaning it, i didn‚Äôt use it. She came home that night and took a shower. The next morning when I got up to take a shower the bottom of the tub was brown. I was honestly impressed by how filthy she made it after just one shower. Not only that but she leaves hair all over the place, leaves puddles on the counter so when I put my clothes down they get wet. Leaves all her shit all over the counter as if I don‚Äôt use it too. I‚Äôve tried asking her to clean up a bit more but as I mentioned above, she ignores me. 

She also comes and goes at all hours. I don‚Äôt necessarily mind that, but she‚Äôs not even quiet about it. She turns on every light, slams doors, talks on the phone, as if I‚Äôm not clearly asleep. And it‚Äôll be like after midnight she comes home the she leaves at like 6am. So she wakes me up twice.

Just yesterday she left for the weekend to see her parents. It‚Äôs 9pm. She comes in to get her stuff. The lights are on because I was awake on my laptop. We even made eye contact. But before she leaves she purposefully turns off each light so I‚Äôm now in the dark. I texted her saying that was not cool, and she said she thought I was asleep. Asleep?

I had gotten into a playful banter with a guy from my class. Next thing I know he was insaulted that I called him a wimp for telling me to off-myself. That's where I was punched 3 times on my left side. Around 50-100 kids witnessed the attack, even my own boyfriend and didn't do anything. The boy looked to the crowd and laughed, then 4 more punches. I dragged myself to the office which was 2 feet away, and told them what happened. Afterwards I was questioned by police then brought to the ER. I am still suffering with vision and hearing loss due to this only being 3 weeks ago. The school said they couldn't expell him due to his IEP/504, which in this case doesn't even apply. They also said that if I were to spread mis-info around the school they would try to sue me, a 16 now 17yr (happened a week before my bday- great timing). Further more they said they can't legally do anything to protect me at school, like even changing a class or lunch. He is currently doing online school with the posibility of coming back to school at anytime. I can't even get a protection order due to it not being allowed for minors who didn't have a romantic or sexual relationship previously. Almost all my teachers are on my side but one, he is my theater teacher (didn't even sign up for that class) who is maried to the director of the school. Due to it being a charter school in its first year only 40% of all teachers need to be certified, so this man has no education on theater. He threatened me on a false basis of slander and I cannot leave his class because it's too far into the year, dispite him making me uncomfrotable. The admins have done nothing to help the situation, some of the boy's friends have been calling me a bitch, or saying the assualt is my fault.

Anyway, we have a resident who requested their locks be changed, no problem, we asked our sister property what day their guy can come out and get this done. We had everything scheduled for today at 10am, well the resident emails me saying ""oh, can we wait until 10:30? I'm not ready."", and normally this wouldn't be a problem, except that they didn't bother to tell me they needed to change the time until ***9:50am***, literally 10 minutes until the service was scheduled.

You remember when I said that our sister property is 45 minutes away? And that this is their maintenance man, who has his own things to do at his own property? We posted a reminder on their door yesterday at 3pm, so they had all night (3pm-8am when we open) to tell me this, but they waited until 10 fucking minutes before the guy was set to change the locks to be like ""Hehe, oopsie"". 

Well, we thought we were good to go on the lock change, so he was already on his way and got here at 9:59am, so I had to ask if he could wait about 30min to change the locks per the resident's request, he could not, so he left. If we had gotten a heads up at any point between 3pm yesterday to 8am today, we could have worked around their schedule and gotten it done, but because of their shitty time management they have to wait.

We had to call a locksmith to see what their availability looks like to come out and re-key the locks and they can't be out here until Monday, no big deal to me but if the resident has an issue with that then it's their own damn fault! You can't set something for a specific time and then just change it last minute, if this were a company we were using they would have said ""no, we either do this now or you need to reschedule."", so why is it any different for a maintenance man?

We told the resident, ""because you changed the service time at the last minute, the maintenance tech we were borrowing was unable to get this done, we have a locksmith scheduled for Monday between 1-2pm, we will not be changing the time as this is a company we are using, if you are not home we will be going in and performing the service anyway."", so if they again ask if we can wait, it'll be a big fat ***NO******!!!***

I had to deal with the complete lack of direction. The blurb doesn‚Äôt given enough info about the contents of the book. I wish I could just sort through tags to get to the most appealing book.

It‚Äôs also hard to dodge the weirdness in some older books. At least if there‚Äôs sexism in a fanfic it‚Äôs tagged and you can tell the author doesn‚Äôt believe it. Like I need to warned if the most outrageous sexist thing is going to be said and the author actually believes it.

429,Some dating preferences don't make sense,11o36cn,"Posted this somewhere else but it apparently works better here lol.

Before I get comments about 'It's just what I like"" or 'you can't control what you like', ok cool. I don't care what you like and don't like, live your life.

This could come from me being a virgin loser or cause I personally have little to no dating preferences, but certain ones, such as race + hyper specific height and weight, don't make much sense when I think about them.

For height and weight: 

Generalized ones like 'tall' 'slim' etc., I can somewhat understand , but hyper specific ones like '""6'ft"" '140lbs"" I don't get. Are you gonna pull out a ruler and scale when you meet someone?  I have doubts you can tell a persons height just from looking at them. Also people carry weight differently, so no one of the same weight looks the same. Some people try to use the excuse of 'health', which yeah maybe but there's things like metabolism.

For race:

I have yet to hear a reason for a race preference that wasn't either racism or 'Its what I like'. You're basically saying you find one race more or less attractive in looks/personality.

432,There are so many ways our electrical grid could be destroyed that I‚Äôve started to think humanity‚Äôs recent industrial period has been absurd,11o7cdj,"Solar storms, global warming-related natural disasters, and in certain places extreme earthquakes all have the ability to make the electricity go down for extremely long amounts of time.

Already we‚Äôre seeing global warming create weather that‚Äôs hitting the electrical grid in increasingly damaging ways. The attitude I‚Äôve adopted in response is that when my present reality gets destroyed by one or more of these threats to the electrical system, I‚Äôll have new problems, but I‚Äôll also be freed from the problems that can‚Äôt be avoided as long as the lights are on.

I don‚Äôt realistically expect our electrical paradigm to ever lose its dominance over civilization, even if it has to go through a process where it has to rebuild/fortify itself after a catastrophe. With the way that countries like China are helping develop modern infrastructure across the poor countries, electricity and industrialism are in some ways headed for a new boom.

455,"I hate my own personality so much, and have tried valiantly to change it over the years, but to no avail...",11novu4,"As long as I can remember, I've had the worst personality. It's always been extremely difficult for me to make friends, since I was shy and always have panic attacks around people, even with children my own age when I was just a child. As a kid, I figured that it was OK, though, since schoolwork came easily and naturally to me. I figured that it would compensate for my near lack of social skills, but as an adult, that couldn't be farther from the truth.

While the other kids in the class were making friends and struggling with schoolwork, I had the exact opposite problem. During the summer break between every school year, I would vow to be a more outgoing and friendlier person. The early part of the school year was usually a success, but it honestly just felt like I was playing a character, and by the second or third month, I was extremely worn down, and my shitty anxious personality would storm back with a vengeance. Not only was/am I anxious, I would often scream and throw tantrums whenever I was overwhelmed, whether from too much noise, or people relentlessly bullying me. I was the victim, yet I was always the one sent to the principal's office whenever this happened.

At 11 or 12, I figured that I would be going through puberty soon, and that I would become more mature with lessening outbursts and anxiety. However, it seemed like it has only gotten worse. I was able to pass all my high school classes with flying colors, being the top 10 in my class of 300, but my crippling anxiety prevented me from participating in all the relevant teenager activities, such as joining clubs, dating, internships, etc. My college years saw my grades tumbling down like rocks; I used to be able to figure things out on my own without having to ask anybody for help, but now it became paramount to do so. Once again, though, I was too nervous and afraid to make friends or even ask a professor for help; I figured that I would just be bothering or annoying them, and didn't want to be seen at all.

Now I'm nearing 30, and with full brain development happening to most people at 25, I think it's way too late for me to change. Whenever I try, I just feel like I'm wearing a fake skin suit, with all the anxieties of the day wearing me down, until my regular shitty self is front and center again.

I don't make as much money as I should be, because of my lack of desire of a leadership position. Having people under me means more money, but it also means more pressure and anxiety. Plus, I feel bad for anybody who would have to work for a loser like me.

Ever since I was a kid, I've had a pretty irrational fear of bugs. I know, I know, it sounds stupid. But being attractive to the little bastards hasn't helped one bit. Fast forward to today when I'm a grown-ass man, and because Texas practically has an insect breeding kink, I'm met with a yearly mosquito, bee, and hornet problem in my backyard. Sounds childish, I know...

But my father, insensitive old fuck that he is, is always telling me to man up or grow a backbone when it comes to dealing with bugs. Hey fats. I dunno if you know this, but although I'm bigger than them, they still coagulate to our yard because it's hard to control them and they spread like wildfire in this fucking State. I'm applying mosquito repellant to our dog on walks and playing outside, and still I'm having to play a human shield for her because I'm fucking schizo paranoid about how she could get heartworm again from another skeeter bite no matter how strong the repellant.

If something doesn't belong to you in a communal living space, don't fricking use it. It is not yours to use. If you need or want to use it, ask! It's not that hard!

I live in a dorm. most of the time it's great, but this is the biggest issue here. (aside from people dumping liquids in the water fountains because they don't want to go 50 more feet to the sink.)

Put your soap in the kitchen for a day and it's half empty when you come back. Your detergent? Ohoho better not leave that alone while you're doing laundry, because now it belongs to *everyone*. Your specific food items that you brought yourself isn't yours anymore because someone thought it would be a good snack. 

Yes, I know it's common. Yes, it's avoidable if you hoard all your stuff in your room. But that shouldn't be the norm. If people learned some basic decency when it comes to living with others and sharing spaces, it wouldn't be a problem!

People's belongings are specific to the individual because of necessity at times. What if they use specific cleaning supplies because they are allergic to certain chemicals? What if that item you accidentally broke is too expensive for them or you to replace. What if that food you ate was allergy friendly or dietary specific and now that person has to go hungry because allergen free/dietary stuff can be expensive! What if the cookware you used is no longer usable to the owner because you cross contaminated it with a food they can't eat!

If you need those things too, but can't get them on your own dime, there are resources for you! Food banks, free clothing drives, dishware and cookware, house essentials. These are all things that can be given to you for free if you can't afford them.

So we fumbled together all the pieces, tried turning it on-didn't work. Why? No idea. The screen stayed black, but the components were running. Sort of. So we think ""hey, maybe it's the GPU? So we set it up on a different rig. It seems to work here. We now know it must be something else. We try setting the new shit up again, still doesn't work. So maybe it's the Mainboard?

The PC doesn't even turn on... So basically after trying around dozens of times, removing and adding all sorts of components, we now have not a single rig up and running. I basically cannot use my old rig anymore, no matter which specs we put in it, and the new one doesn't work either. My dad has lost all confidence in his capabilities and doesn't want to touch the things anymore. I am totally useless and feel incredibly helpless.

Then I find out that I'm only getting a month of severance and will not be receiving the bonus that I worked the whole year for. 

I filed for unemployment benefits and kept in touch with a few of my team members. Come to learn that my replacement was quite awful to the team and quit after 2 months. 

Today I received a letter from the unemployment workforce division letting me know that I need to schedule a call with them to discuss why I don't have a job, yet. 

I mean, WTH? My previous employer is paying for my unemployment. THEY canned ME. Now my role is again open. Not that I want it. But, are they going to get a call? My guess is no. 

This is just so degrading. I am working my rear end off trying to find a job while dealing with so many denials and ghosting by recruiters, barely covering my bills, all while trying to maintain a smile for the next interview and to keep my sanity. 

What is even more painful is that right now, I have it so much better than others. I also consciously make decisions for the just in case situations, but even those can run out.

To keep the ""Telenovela"" short: Around 1/2 years ago, I joined a college film-club. Our ""manager"" (not official -she just voluntairly manages the money etc.) introduced a new pot. topic for our next film: 70s. Obviously, with highlight of 70s movies and encouraging us to share ideas over the holidays. I ended up researching and creating a small presentation about my idea. After the manager seemingly gave me the ""ok"", I introduced it to the others who liked it too. 

Welp. Turns out that was the wrong move. Our film-club was not as ""democratic"" and Manager deerest saw herself as its Kindergartener. Me presenting my idea was not only ""theft"" to her, it was an insult to her hierarchie. Something which...she told me not until it was too late. Just assumed I ""got it"". After several ""polite arguments"" later, she distanced herself from the project. Aka ""fine. Do what you want, I just don't help."" Something which I found horribly petty, but -okay. I had a plan that everyone would like. A script that was simple enough, but unique still. Something which both honoured the 70s movies in satire, but also the actual reality that 70s people in my country lived through. A fun project...but with respect.

But as we all know...if there's still run time, the villain ain't dead.

Just today, a message popped into the group chat. According to her, she had now ""listened to many suggestions"" and seemingly ""came to a following conclusion"":

My movie, except...a movie-clip compilation.

I am not joking.

Basically, the idea goes back on the idea of Manager 2. M2 is the opposite of Manager 1, by being very direct, but also fairy laissez-faire. His ideas are grounded on ""little work, much fun"" (literal quote). Which is rather understandable in itself: If you make something too complicated, it can become draining. Especially if you're not as passionate (or paid) for it.

So where's the problem? Well. M1 is putting them up against each other. We should ""both try out and look what we like more"". More specifically; she tries to ""kill"" my project by introducing the most mind-numbing simple idea, making my project seem too complicated in return. And I can say that with confidence, because...no offense to my colleagues, but they're more interested in ""playing movie"" than ""making movie"". So you gotta fun them up for everything. The ""winner"" is then suddenly our group project \[my title\].

Well. Jokes on her! I already know not only a way we can do both without competition, but also in a way that will actually help my movie! A way in which everyone can learn and gain passion for 70s movies & 70s! I will use the boards she puts up to build me a staircase to heaven!

490,"I have a good life, but I just feel so inadequate.",11n0ji6,"I'm a 21 year old male. On paper, I have a great life. I'm about to get my bachelor's degree in August with a good GPA of like 3.4, then a year after that I will have a Master's degree and hopefully I will pass my CPA exam.

I'm working an internship at an accounting firm making $32 an hour while I am there, I have about $700 monthly expenses so the rest of it is going directly towards savings. Granted, I'm paying for my last year of schooling, and I might have to pay for my Master's degree which is roughly $10-15k, but I will probably have enough for it and even enough to take my CPA exam. Not to mention I am filling out scholarship applications in order to try and curb that amount.

I have a family who cares about me, if anything a little much because I feel slightly constrained by them. I have a brother who has got my back and will bend over backwards for me, if really necessary. I have a good friend who we constantly check up on each other, and constantly help each other out. I have a group of online friends that I don't talk to a lot but when I do, they are always pretty welcoming. Sure, one of them includes my former best friend though who I realized was just using me to vent. She left for 8 months after breaking up with another member in the group, and she came back recently, although it was only to try and get back with him, I thought it was because they missed or liked hanging out with me. That sucks, but it isn't a big deal.

I have a girlfriend that cares a lot about me. We have our issues though, we haven't had sex in like 2.5 months, and in the nearly 7 months we have been together, we have had sex probably 7ish times. I know we are busy, and with our parents in our homes it makes it kind of hard, but it doesn't even sound like she has the desire to have sex. In the few times we have an opportunity, she is always too tired, or she hasn't shaved, or she doesn't feel like it. Which is totally fine, I am not entitled to her body, but now I don't want to ask because I'm just getting rejected, I don't want to guilt or force her into it, so I'm waiting on her to ask. It's been a long time now. It feels worse considering she used to regularly have sex with a guy before we met. I feel inadequate.

Even when we have had sex though, it's bad. She took my virginity, so obviously I am bad at sex, but holy shit I did not think I would be this bad. She gets off most of the time, I have gotten off once. I know this is because I struggle from porn addiction. Before her, I used to get off everyday to my own hand, when I first got with her, that subsided a lot actually, but it didn't help. Now that it's been a long time, I've come back to using it all the time. How hard is it to fucking stop doing something? It seems so fucking easy, it makes me feel inadequate.

With my schooling, I feel so overwhelmed all the time, I'm trying to work 40 hours with my internship if possible, while also taking 4 classes, I'm doing the bare minimum in school, barely keeping up. If I don't work 40 hours though, I may not save enough to accomplish my schooling and CPA in a timely manner, I also want to make a good impression of my employer. I haven't read a single chapter of my accounting law book since the semester started; I got a B on the exam. I manage to pull it off by studying well I guess, but I don't know how I will replicate it. It's not a case of impostor syndrome because I don't believe my success is due to luck, but man I feel like I will fail at any second, it makes me feel inadequate.

My internship is so difficult. I don't know how I will actually make it in this field. I feel like I don't know what I am doing. Constantly annoying people with questions, make the progress of a snail, not sure how they don't realize how bad I am at this. And to think that at the end of the internship I was going to ask for a part time position while I go to school. I feel inadequate.

I recently got into an accident. It was my fault, I was not paying attention, looking out the window instead of the road, and rear-ended a guy going 20 mph, I tried to break and swerve, but I didn't slow down fast enough. I pushed him into another car, now I am responsible for both. Everyone is okay, but my god is it expensive. I have already paid $1000 to get my truck in working order, and that is not including the couple hundred dollar bumper I need to get, and the citation I need to show up to court for, and the raised insurance premiums I will need to pay. I also got my tires aligned, and it turns out my outer tire rod is torn, the end links need to be replaced, and the upper control arm is in bad shape, $885 fix. Even though, this tire stuff is in bad shape, I know it wasn't from the accident, that being said it is still draining my emergency fund. How could I not pay attention? It makes me feel inadequate.

Then because of this stupid self improvement mindset I try to have, I constantly internally question my friends and girlfriend to see if they are good for me. It gives me an us vs. them mindset and I hate it. For example, with my girlfriend, I try my best to help her out. Her dog is having behavior issues, I offer non-corrective solutions to try and help, and I try to help implement those solutions but she veers towards using corrective solutions. She has not learned how to drive yet so I drive her everywhere. I can't teach her because she has no vehicle to learn, and she can't use mine because my dad owns the vehicle, and it is too risky for him to allow her to learn. Her parents refuse to help her. I looked up that driving lessons in Las Vegas are $600 which is quite a lot, but worth it. It also looks good for insurance, and it means she doesn't have to buy a vehicle to learn, she can instead go straight to a motorcycle like she wants.

It's obviously a lot of money, but she does not save at all. I consider myself to be pretty good with money, so I offered to help her budget so she can slowly save up for it and make progress towards it, and at first she was willing but when we actually started she didn't want to. I'm not going to control her finances because it is not my place, so I have just left her to work on it. She hasn't made progress towards it, and is constantly stressed about it, and it bothers me because I want to help but she does not want my help. 

These kinds of issues bother me and make me wonder if we are a good fit together, but I know she is going through her own stuff, and who am I to judge what she does. I don't want to control her. She is probably going through more than I am (Like most people, they go through much worse than what I go through), and I know she is trying her best. I feel shitty for thinking this way because we are doing the best with what we are given, so who am I to deem her unworthy or something for doing the best that she can, and have it not be enough for me. I feel like a piece of shit for it, because I am sure I am doing things that bother her that I do not know about. Yet she talks about how I am the nicest guy she has ever dated and how I am always so sweet to her.

I'm scared to mention these things to her though, because she does not take criticism well, and she sometimes ""splits"" when I give her a lot of feedback about things that bother me because it makes her panic.

I love my girlfriend, I really do. So I don't know why my brain sabotages me with making me think we maybe shouldn't be together. I feel so lost, and I don't want to make a move because I feel like whatever move I make, I'm damned if I do or damned if I don't. This only adds to my feeling of inadequacy. I feel this way with my friends too, where I see things that make me question if they are good friends for me, but like cmon brain, they are doing the best they can as well. Who am I to judge them for that?

This doesn't even touch other topics, like how I can't get off my phone, I can't get myself to practice piano, I can't get myself to tell anyone these things because people think I have it together and everyone I know thinks I am so nice all the time when in reality I am always so mean to myself.

497,Struggling with my identity,11ml5w5,"Hi, I am an average 26 year old male and I don't know what I am.
Let it be career wise or relationship wise, I think I am just not being true to myself.
There are many things I follow because that's what parents or society expects but at the same time it has been burdensome.
Another thing I am like a liquid, I manage to change my personality to fit in with whoever I come across.

Sexual identity -
I have only been in a straight relationship that was ages ago. I am pretty sure I am straight but then it baffles me how for the past 10 years how I never ended up in another relationship.
I have tried light stuff with a male, but it just felt traumatic but still I get urges from time to time. Never felt a crush on any guy I know in real life though.
At the same time I also think I could be asexual. Or most likely a demisexual. Maybe could trans idk. 

Career-
I enjoy my job from time to time, I am certainly good at it. It pays decent and with work from home as become my comfort zone. Still I hate when on random days if I have to work 8+ hours. 
I have many hobbies- reading, drawing, exercising/running, gaming, learning languages but I am slightly above average in all. 
I just never end up pursuing one thing. 

Society /parents' / my expectations - 
I seem to follow these expectations for myself and it feels caged sometimes. 
Sometimes I just think I have two different personalities in me fighting for what they want. 

Friends/relationships-
I used to be a lonely person but that changed last year. I socialized, made friend and from that point on just kept making friends. 
Now I have some good friends whom I rely from time to time which is a good thing. 
But at the same time it annoys me that I made so many friends but how come none of them were not interested in me for relationships. 

Low self esteem - 
Why do I have low self esteem when I am better at most things than a normal person. 
I do not know. I wonder is it because I am not being true to myself. 


Life changing disease-
I was diagnosed with MDR TB few months ago, which changed many things for me. I have to be on medication for it for over the year and then hope it does not come back. 
But being diagnosed with this, although now I am free to socialize again the doubts keeps coming to my mind that I am Infectious and will never meet someone because of that. 

That was most of the rant. Thank you for reading if you did. 
I had couple of sessions with a therapist but it was not good enough- they kept coming back MDR TB and did not know about disease much. I will consult one but currently can't find any.",soulsurfer96,0,6,0.88

503,"In my homophobic family eyes, the LGBTQ+ are just as bad as pedophiles and people that does incest.",11mg1ob,"I was just testing waters again with my family so that I can come out, they started off just passionately shitting on the trans community. As buddhists, we believe in reincarnation, and we believe in karma. They believe that trans people and gay people are people who did terrible things in their past life and is punished by being in a body they aren't satisfied in, and it's unnatural.

So now I'll get to the main focus of the topic, I asked them why they can't just accept it and asked ""It's already there, it exists, people are doing it, shouldn't it be considered nnatural?"" and my father got pissed off at me and said,

""People are fucking children, it's already there, but it's not natural is it? Just because you can fuck your own mother you wouldn't because it's not natural is it?""

That comparison really hurt me to the bone, like fuck me, I just smiled and nodded. The conversation ruined my father's mood for the rest of the day as well which made me feel bad as well. 

It's made me question myself again, like it took a lot to settle my mind that it as okay to be bisexual, and it's okay to want to dress feminine, but the way he said those things really threw me back into a hole that I tried so hard to climb out of. I'm even questioning if I have the rights to judge incests and pedos now, like, am I really as low as them?

I'm trying to tell myself that I should have my own morales instead of adopting my family but what he said is just lingering with me. And I'm left with the choice between getting disowned by coming out or remaining a family by keeping it a secret. I mentioned it in a previous post, My family is great. Even thought they qualify as all three homophobe, racist and sexist they're the nicest people you can meet, as long as you don't get into politics which they will avoid. So between the choice of being a twink like I want to be and being a good son to my father's standards, I'd rather be a good son.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

Asked my father why he considers trans and gay people as unnatural when they already exist, doesn't that already mean it's natural, he replied with ""Pedophiles exists and we don't consider them natural, you can fuck your mother but you won't because it's not natural. Why should I consider these morons as natural."" Now I'm questioning if I have the rights to judge other people who I consider to be unnatural.",HorrorCriticism3433,2,4,0.83

506,I am absolutely repulsed by the amount of greed surrounding people's death when people think they're entitled to something.,11lwq8y," 

My mother passed away Monday night, and in the morning I was immediatelly bombarded by calls from ""relatives"" I never speak to ""inquiring"" about whether I have inherited something or not. The entire day was a fucking nightmare and I am absoulutely repulsed by the people surrounding my family and myself. THESE PEOPLE AREN'T EVEN RELATED OR FRIENDS WITH MY MOTHER.

With that out of the way, I'm going to tell you all what happened.

My relationship with my mother was complicated, but she tried to patch things up for the last few months and we started getting along. She told me she had four types of Cancer, 2 of them spreading quite fast, but everyione (hewrself included) was told she AT LEAST had 5 months to live, if not a few more years.

On Wednesday, I noticed my mother asn't responding to any of my calls and messages- That's when her best friend told me she was at the ICU, but that ""she would pull through"" and not to freak out. Hell, the doctros were ven convinced that she'd make it.

Escept she didn't. Monday evening, she passed away.

The next day, a very short service was held, as my family wanted to keep our affairs private- Still, the rumors spread like wildfire. I was so exhausted from crying when I returned, that I just crawled into my bed and fell asleep. While I was asleep, I was getting bombarded by calls and messages (though my phone was on mute). This didn't make me immune, though- As soon, my stepmother and paternal grandmother (people who haven't spoken to my mother in YEARS), proceeded to call my boyfriend and IMMEDIATELLY start asking about whether I inherited something, how much, etc.

My boyfriend said that what they were doing was completely inappropriate and started to ignore them. My grandmother got the messsage, but my stepmother? Oh no.

She proceeded to send him PARAGRAPHS and 10 minute long voicemails insulting him, insulting me, my brother, everything. My boyfriend had enough and contacted my brother (Who had cut off my stepmother completely), and basically said ""Hey, this woman is using burner phones to harrass your sister and ask about inheritances-"" Basically, he asked for help.

My brother did indeed help, but he might have taken it too far. He unblocked my stepmother and proceeded to rip her a new one, which resulted in her sending him a barrage of messages, saying things like:  
""Your mother didn't love you, she hired hitmen to kill you"" (Not true)  
""You were a failure as a son, no wonder she died hating you"" (Also not true)  
Among other vile, disgustiong things- Only changing her tune when she wanted to inquire about my possible inheritance. Oh, and a lot of death threats. SO MANY death threats.

These messages have all been saved and stored, in case we want to take legal action. This isn't the first time my stepmother tries to swoop in when she senses I'm vulnerable, only to go absolutely apeshit and say the most vile shit when she doesn't get what she wants. This includes, but is not limited to:  
""I hope you kill yourself"" (Said to me after being hospitalized after a suicide attempt)  
""Your boyfriend is a Narco (Because he has a single weed plant- which is legal where I live)""  
""You are a whore who fucks your boyfriend's friends for money because he's a pimp"" (Also not true)""  
""I will hire a hitman to kill you and your entire family"" (Doubtful,she definetly can't afford a hitman, at least)

I have her blocked completely, only my boyfriend had her unblocked in case something happened to my father and he needed any help. My boyfriend acts as a ""filter"" for her, because her calls and messages have triggered panic attacks in the past. I won't get into details about how abusive she is, but this should give you an idea about the type of person she is.

I'm so utterly baffled and disgusted at how people can be. They didn't speak of my mother, they didn't ask how I was, nothing- Just straight up started to ask about money that  
a) Is not confirmed that I'll even get and  
b) They are ABSOLUTELY NOT entitled to in ANY way.

So yeah, on top of dealing with the grief of losing my mother and being inher wake, I have to deal with a bunch of fucking vultures trying to scope what they could get their grubby little hands on.

520,I feel very unintelligent...,11m56r4,"when I say I feel unintelligent, I'm not saying that I don't know stuff, I certainly do, I know quite a bit about the subjects that I'm passionate about like. digital and tabletop games and digital art. but it feels like that's the only thing that I'm intelligent about. give me a subject about pokemon and I'll write a 5 page essay about why I like my favorite pokemon. but if you quizzed me about anything that's happening in the world or about any historical event or about pretty much any other subject that doesn't involve the stuff I like I'll just fall flat on my face.

it's not even just about world events. sometimes I can't spell english words correctly even though they are the most common words used ever. I spell ""enough"" as ""enouph"" because it just makes sense to me and I hate that I'm forced to correct myself every time I make that mistake. heck, I don't even capitalize my ""I's"" in my sentences.

I feel bad that I sometimes don't know anything about a subject that my friends are talking about.

I sometimes joke about how I genuinely don't know stuff. but the joke is actually true and it has been a common inside joke in my friend group.

there are even moments where I actually feel proud that there is something that I know that my other friends dont. like the time I had to solve a complicated Minecraft restone contraption that I actually managed to figure out. but once again, my knowledge about most things is almost exclusively about Games, drawing, and my job.

my friends talk about things almost as if it's common knowledge and it frustrates me that I don't know these things.

I feel like I represent the terrible American stereotype that everyone associates Americans with and it frustrates me so much.

sometimes I make stupid decisions simply because there is a factor in my decision-making that I never considered. like how I waited a week for my grandpa to take me grocery shopping when I could have just called my brother to drive me to my local aldi's if I needed something.

when I try something new I always find it confusing to learn because I have never done something like this before.

I can barely do basic math without the need for a calculator.

I can't get anywhere by myself because I don't have a car. this is because my parents didn't think I was responsible enough to drive a car. but if I learned how to drive then I would have been responsible enough to do those things.

my parents have to hold my hand through college because I don't know how to navigate the website or how to register or how to change the degree that I want to pursue.

I had an argument with a friend on how I thought mud was the same as dirt because mud was made from exclusively dirt and water.

I watch videos online all day and I feel like my brain is turning into mush.

my dad keeps telling me that I am a smart kid but I just don't feel like that's true at all.

521,I hate when people ask for money after being irresponsible,11lyw6m,"Friend of mine who has no savings at all, did save up so they could take a trip. Not to go see family or anything, just a trip to go have fun. 
I'm not faulting her for that, I'm glad she took a trip. But it was several states away, was a very expensive flight, and she stayed in a pretty pricey hotel. Again she saved up for it so good for her.
However as soon as she got back, she sent a message to me and a few other friends asking if she could borrow some money. Saying she doesn't have enough to make it until payday

I said no, and I believe most of our other friends did too, but now she's mad because we ""true friends would have loaned her money"". I didn't say it but my opinion is if she was that broke, she really shouldn't have spent all that money on a vacation. She could have taken time off and done something closer to home. Or at least try to stay in a cheaper hotel or something.

But I see stuff like this happen all the time in my FB feed, my friends always saying Oh I just need a little bit to get through payday if someone could venmo me. But a few days prior there are posting photos from a vacation

Everyone should be allowed to take a vacation, and not getting paid enough is a whole other issue.

She stumbled backwards and had blood running down her nose, I turned around to get back into my car and go to a different gas station. Except I couldn‚Äôt, because she grabbed onto my arm and started hitting me on my back. I snapped and threw an extremely hard punch into her bloody nose. She fell on the ground screaming and crying. I got on top of her and started to choke her, and suddenly I realized what I was doing. I got off of her, she kept screaming, and I drove off and got gas about 20 miles down the road.

28,"My friend's sister said to leave, so he did",11vfwn2,"So me and my best friend has known each other for almost a decade. He was living with his step dad that adopted him around 1, and the place he was living in was a trailer except with extensions to make it bigger. One of the rooms right next to his has black mold over half the wall, no central air or nothing. He was working where ever the man's daughters were working, he wanted to work at a warehouse to make more money but their dad said ""no because I want to pick up everyone at one time"" he would also take away money my friend's money, and charge him whatever he got payed so he couldn't save up money to leave. My friend didn't have a driver's license or even a permit, when my friend asked his step dad about it he would say next week, or even next month however never did it. My friend also gotten taken advantage of, his step dad would tap into his bank account and steal money from my friend taxes to pay for the step dads property taxes. Eventually a couple years ago by and his step dads dementia was getting worse he had forgotten that my friend existed and was helping out with bills. So my friend ended getting a gun shoved into his face telling him to leave, after getting him to realize who he was he calmed down. My friend was also the only one working for cash to support 3 people other than himself on a fast food restaurant pay. After a while his step dad has a stroke goes to the hospital and leaves the hospital, after 5 days the search team finds him dead in the woods. My friend then was taking care of 2 of his step sister's that lived with him, and giving gas money to the 1 step sister who had kids and was hopping guys for some cash net. The 1 step sister was unique in quite some bad ways, she got my buddy his permit and I fixed the step sister's van in agreement that she would teach him how to drive which never happened except for 1 time. After the funeral for the step dad the 1 step sister told the 2 step sister to pay for everyone's lunch and dinner for the funeral guests. She did, paying about 300$ for Golden Carrol and food for dinner. Then the 1 step sister also put a GoFundMe for her dad's funeral, my friend's girlfriend put in 100$, the 1 step sister then took all the money for the funeral and spent it in 2 days on a so called ""vacation"". So naturally me, my mom, my friend, and his girl was very pissed off. Then a couple weeks go by and my friend is still supporting them, me, my mom, and his girl start telling my friend that it's not his responsibility to take care of them. After all the 2 step sister is 28 and my friend is 24. None of the step sister's wanted to get a job because ""jobs piss them off"". My friend then ended staying with the 1 step sister for 2 weeks taking 1 shower a week, she told him he had to pay their water bill which was 150$ for taking 2 showers. Then 2 weeks after that she then used part of the GoFundMe to buy and above ground pool for 500$ and then filled it up at the house my friend was staying at which costed 500$. 1 step sister told him ""he couldn't go In it"", in which I replied when hearing that, ""screw that you paid for the water we're both going in"". She then wouldn't pay him anything, after a while, the 1 step sister would then peer pressure the 3 step sister to be on her side or get abandoned. After a while all the step sister's was getting angry at my friend and even threatened to break his stuff on numerous occasions. Lifting my friend Xbox up and dropping it a few feet, I tried to go over there whenever I could to help him stay calm. He eventually was told he wasn't part of the family and to get out, so he did. He moved out with his girlfriend and I helped out. I seen how he was treated throughout half his life and I'm glad he got away from that crazy place. He is doing much better and yes I left out some details to make sure no one could know who this is coming from.

31,A fucking waste of human flesh hit my parked motorcycle and left a note with a phony number,11vdo8w,"If you have ever done this, just know that I think less of you than the rancid turd I left in the toilet.  You treat my property that I paid for with my hard earned money like garbage?  I hope you lose everything and become homeless and have to watch other people have things to enjoy.

It was my 3rd ride of the new spring.  I put thousands of dollars and many of my own hours into that bike two winters ago.  Not only was my bike hauled away on a trailer to be processed by the insurer, but I was left stranded in the next town and ended up paying a stranger to drive me home after his shift ended at 10pm.

Maybe the damage is superficial.  Maybe you damaged the rear axle, chain tensioner or even the gear box.  You really fucked up the hard luggage that is now jammed and cocked half out of the mounting rail.  And you left it precariously balanced on the side stand which was a hair trigger away from folding back in and collapsing the bike on anyone unlucky enough to touch it.

An honest person would have gone inside the establishment and looked for someone in riding gear.  An honest person would have put their own name and a real phone number with the messy message scrawled on the back of someone else's business card, so I wouldn't have called some poor random tax accountant demanding to know why they hit my bike and didn't come find me.

But you are not an honest person.  You probably were driving without insurance, or you took daddy's car without asking and didn't want to get in trouble.  Did you tell him you dropped something on it in the garage?

Do you sleep well at night knowing that the world hates people like you?  People who dont take responsibility for their actions?  There were lots of small children around that establishment today, at least 3 separate birthday parties.

Kids were admiring my bike.  Can you sleep well tonight knowing how easy it would have been for it to fall over on one of them, crushing them?  Can you sleep easy knowing even though the evidence shows it wouldn't  have been my fault that I would still have had nightmares about the poor kid?

Do you think life is all about you, and as long as you can get away with it nothing else matters?  Well, one day you won't get away with it, and the consequences will change your life for the worse.  Hopefully just your life, but maybe someone else's too.  Can you look someone in the eye after your carelessness, selfishness and disregard for others took their loved one from them?

How do you live with yourself when you knowingly write a fake number on a note?  How do you look in your dishonest eyes in the mirror and not hate what you see?  Hate who you are?   How does the world not see in your eyes the fraud you are?  Oh, they know.  Anyone who is a worthy human being can see you for who you really are and will turn and walk away from you.  The only people who are willing to be near you are the frauds and liars like you.

And you tell each other the world hates you so fuck em.  Well, the feeling is mutual but you deserve it, not us.  We who live honest lives will move on.  Yes, it stings to be treated like you did, but we have happy lives to return to because despite what others do to us we live honest lives.  Because our honesty and integrity bring us love and support and community that is far richer than your miserable lives.

You may interfere with us from time to time, but you will stay out where you belong, with the dogs and the rats.  You will shake your fist at us for being cast out but you have cast yourself out by your own lies and deceipt.  A fraud will always be an outcast in society, and you are a fraud.",Jesssica_Rabbi,0,8,0.83

39,Tired of people arguing about certain shows being anime.,11va601,"I am tired of people arguing whether shows like ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" or ""Castlevania"" are anime. Here's definition for you.

If you are in Japan:

'Anime' is Japanese for 'animation'. Which means that everything animated is anime. ""Catlevania"", ""Powerpuff Girls"", ""Frozen"", everything

If you are in the West:

'Anime' is a term for animation made specifically in Japan. Western shows can be anime-influenced (like ""Avatar"" or the majority of modern shows like ""She-Ra"" or ""Amphibia""), but they can not be called anime.

So, if you live in the West (I assume majority of you are), or anywhere else outside East Asia, American shows can not be anime by definition. It is time to stop stigmatizing the word 'cartoon'. People are ashamed they love a 'cartoon', so they say 'anime' instead'. There are so many lovely Western cartoons these days, both for adult and family-friendly. This stigma must go away.

'Cartoon' isn't just ""Baby Boss"" or ""Family Guy"". Cartoon is also ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"", ""Gravity Falls"", ""Infinity Train"", ""Arcane"", ""Invincible"", ""She-Ra and the Princesses of Power"", ""Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse"", ""The Owl House"", etc.",First_Mechanic9140,0,1,0.66

Like when Palpatine returned  in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. And the sad thing is I feel like a lot of writers are sacrificing story writing for cameos. And if all characters keep coming back, it makes their death less meaningful. Every time I watch a character die on TV, I think to myself ‚Äúthey‚Äôre probably going to come back‚Äù. Script writers need to focus more on story writing than bringing back old characters from death or in a flashback scene.",TrainerAppropriate19,1,2,1.0

I hate myself because I love you, even tho you don't care enough about me to even check on me anymore. You don't smile anymore when you see me and you don't run to hug me and hold me up anymore and the only reason you did that in the first place was to get me to sleep with you three whole times before you dump me for the first other female that agreed to go out with you. I hate myself because I moved out of my parents just to see you, because I felt bad saying no to you all the time. I moved out even tho I can barely afford rent... And you just dumped me and I was heartbroken.  You said you didn't want me to feel used, but you did use me. Whether you intended to or not, you did use me and it hurts, and you're still using me, and I hate me because I let you, and I beg you just so I don't have to say goodbye just for one more day..

I hate that  when I saw you at the pub after you dumped me.. you came to my table and you were smiling.. like you used to. I hate myself because I came back that day to sit with you and you looked at me the same way.. and it's been haunting me, cause you don't feel shit for me, you just smile at me and look at me so you don't have to tell me whenever the f\*ck you might feel. Which is mostly jack sh\*t because if you felt anything for me, you would have at least asked me if I'm ok. You stopped asking me out, you stopped sending me things, you stopped caring about me you just try to be a good guy and come see me when I need you.. And I hate myself because when I *do* need someone, I always call you and you're almost always there. And I keep asking you. Because I keep needing you. And I keep bothering you. I hate myself so much because every fiber of my being is aching to just hold you until I'm asleep.

I hate myself because I only get drunk so I can sleep at your place. Because when you sleep you hold me like you love me. And you don't. But it's the only moment in time that I feel peace. Just when you hold me, when we're sleeping and you run your fingers between mine and pull me close and just sleep... And then when I have to go you ask me to stay more.. You hug me..

You hate me when we're awake and you love me when we're asleep and I'm just here crying because I just don't want to sleep without you one more day.

I hate myself because I've fallen hard for you and you just push me away in daylight and pull me close at night. Literally. I hate myself because I told you I love you and that I'm sorry.

This system is messed up and what should (at the very least) happen imo is... Get rid of the numbers and make the review either positive, negative or mixed with a bigger emphasis on the text aspect.

72,"We were in a GOLDEN AGE of art, but AI is slowly ending it.",11unf6c,"
The whole appeal of art, at least in part,  is appreciating the skill of the craft. It was hand made, every artist had their own little touch that made it theirs. You appreciated the time and effort it would take to make. Then the visual appeal. Its like eye candy. Its what made the internet a EUTOPIA for art. For browsing, creating, sharing, critisizing, and appreciating art.

The internet did this for millions of people, millions of times a day. Things like the rennaissance couldnt even compare to this age of history. We had an amazing technology that fueled one of mankinds oldest passions. Thousands of years lead to that one moment someone first shared their art online in the 90s. 

And now its all over. With the rise of AI images, if I see a perfectly drawn imagine online with a specific criteria of style, my first instinct isnt ""Holy crap this is a talented artist"", its ""Is this AI generated?"" For a short while it was easy to tell if it was AI or not due to the hands and other distinct features,  but newer stuff looks indestinguishable from actual art. I imagine withing a year itll be even harder to tell. I cant even imagine 5-10 years. People are definitely going to lie and say its handmade when its completely AI. When that happens, art as we know it will be extinct.

And now for the unhinged rant. This fucking pisses me off. These days it seems like art is, or WAS-the one pure and positive thing ANYONE could partake in and enjoy, but now theyve turned it into mass produced SLOP. From a societal view, ai has chewed art up, spit it out, and said ""Stop enjoying things, get back to work.""

For some prompters, theyre just doing it to spite artists. Either out of jealousy, or theyre trying to get back at us for shooting down their dumb NFT investment schemes. For others they genuinely convinced themselves that THEYRE the ones creating the images and not a computer. Theyre SO DESPERATE for instant validation due to a steady diet of social media, that theyd GLADLY fuck over the entire art space and everyone in it, if it means they can get that small bit of dopamine.

Every time someone uses it, they whine about how it breaks system updates and having essential parts of the OS go missing.

***THAT'S BECAUSE YOU TRUSTED SOME STRANGER TO FUCK AROUND WITH THE SYSTEM FILES, YOU IDIOTS***

Bloat is HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE LABEL, and the only way for you to truly debloat anything is to DO IT YOURSELVES. Oh, you want to play Halo MCC, but you can't login to Xbox live? WELL TOO FUCKIN' BAD, because the clown that makes these debloated ISOs thinks that you don't need it. And if you do want to start using Windows properly instead of relying on a Frankenstein of a system, ***ALL OF THE BLOAT COMES BACK, DEFEATING THE PURPOSE.***

If you want a customized Windows install without things breaking, you can always use the tried and true method of ***USING A VANILLA INSTALLER, AND TWEAKING IT YOURSELF.*** That is *LITERALLY* what these ""debloated"" ISOs do, and they give you *SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CONTROL* as to what you want to be removed.

Oh, you enjoy the thrill of having an unapproved installer image because it somehow sticks it to Microsoft (when it actually doesn't)? There's a special thing called *UUPDUMP, THAT LETS YOU BUILD YOUR OWN FUCKING ISOS WITH OFFICIAL SOURCES.* There are so many more effective ways available to make Windows tolerable, ***WITHOUT UNKNOWINGLY INSTALLING 500 FUCKING CRYPTOMINERS TO DO SO.***",egstein01,2,3,1.0

-Immediately question (and not respect) boundaries put in place on day one, like letting us know ahead of time if someone is coming over, dedicated fridge/bathroom space

-steal personal belongings

-steal food

-put up a pole in our living room to host private sessions, won‚Äôt say when they‚Äôre having a session, then expects privacy for said session

-scream at the top of their lungs and insist on waking me up when there are bugs in the house

-when confronting about problems, says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be passive aggressive, keep the vibes good‚Äù in the most passive aggressive, condescending tone

-talk shit about me to our RA and find out concerns I confidentially bring up

-openly mocks, talks shit, and gangs up on us, especially when drunk

-smokes inside making the house wreak

-steals the toilet paper and hogs it in their bedroom, doesn‚Äôt restock it

-showers and uses the toilet with the door wide open

-locks the bathroom for an hour to get ready, not letting anyone use the toilet or shower

-blasts music in all hours of the day, sometimes as early as 6 am

-runs the heater past 80 and doesn‚Äôt want the ac on during heat waves

-doesn‚Äôt clean

-clogs toilet and drains, leaves it

-takes out trash but just leaves the smelly bags in the living room instead

-leaves out food for days or until moldy

-leaves a mess after cooking elaborate meals, claims to be ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù

-leaves the freezer and fridge open

-leave the gas, burner and oven on

-quarantines in the living room and has no respect for personal boundaries when sick

-lets people sleep in our living room, either not telling us or letting them stay longer than we agreed upon (most was 8 days once)

-screams and bangs on the ceiling when the upstairs neighbors have *fun*

-has guys over at very late hours, is incredibly, unapologetically loud when they have *fun*

-either gets mad at me for things they do themselves or makes up things I have done that have never happened

Last night at 3am my long-term girlfriend and I broke up. It was a tumultuous relationship with many ups and downs. The downs never being so low and the ups never being so high. 

My ex and I started dating when I was a junior in college. She was a working foreigner as an au-pair and we met online. I was head over heels for her. She is an amazing person who has a heart of gold for other people. There are a lot of great things about her. Overall, she is a strong, passionate, kind and intelligent person. I really wanted her to be the one, i really tried hard.

Every weekend, I would drive 3 hours to visit her during the school year. It was a sacrifice i was willing to make, and i felt happier spending my time with her than with the people on campus. Though i did want to participate in school events and occasionally hang with friends on the weekends , this was the start of her abusive behavior via emotional control. She would make me feel guilty for wanting to spend time with my friends, which i never got to do during the school week. I was really in to magic the gathering at the time and we would like to play on the weekends.

After driving to her residence for nearly 2 years almost every weekend, i got a job near her place. She then enrolled in a community college, which was encouraged by me, my family, and her family. She wanted to go to school but wasn't confident enough to think she could commit to it. She moved 1.5 hours away from me, so again for the next 2 years I spent every weekend driving 3 hours to visit her. She ended up living with my parents for a few months until she was able to find an apartment of her own, during this time she was stressed about living with my parents, my parents were stressed about having her in their house and having to take her to school (her school was next to my dads office and their time schedule aligned). I did the math to see if it would be better to take an Uber to school every day or to buy a car.... I bought a car! A 2010 Buick LaCrosse for $8,500 USD. It was all under my name so if I needed to sell it and for liability reasons. I was only going to buy a car for her if I had complete ownership and she would he added to the insurance as the primary driver. Needless to say this put a lot of financial stress on me. She took great care of the car, just some minor cosmetic issues. I am really proud of her for being so respectful and responsible. 

After about a year at community college Covid hit and I dipped from my office letting my boss know i would be working from home. She and I moved in together at her apartment. I couldn't help her pay the bills except for utility because i was still broke and still paying for my apartment. Both of us just thought it made sense to live together during this time. This was a stressful time and I think subconsciously learned we were incompatible. Her desire to immediate get things done, while good, was not my style to be more casual. And our personalities really clashed during this time. After, what seems like, a year i moved back to my apartment because lockdowns were ""over"". I got a nice promotion and raise and life just became financially easy. 

During the next year or so I wanted a career change (best decision I have made). I tried really hard to find a position in the company to move in to, but ultimately i had to go with another company across the United States. She was relatively supportive of my decision and we continued a long distance relationship - we were accustomed to long distance so it was okay.

During her time in school at community college and her university, I helped her with her studies almost every day. I never asked for anything in return, just respect. Me helping became an expectation and put a lot of stress on me from the beginning of her schooling - i would help her read books (english is her second language) by reading all her books out loud and explaining things she didn't understand. I would read over and correct her papers too. She ended up graduating from Uni with no debt and with a 4.0. She really deserved it. After about 4 years of helping her with school it definitely took a mental strain on me. Working 9-12 hours and then correcting a 10 page essay with aweful grammar (I don't have the best grammar either) took a lot out of me. I am still trying to juggle having some semblance of a personal life, trying to make friends and just enjoy my freedom. Her last year in school, she barely needed my help and it was a major relief for me. She nearly became fully self-sufficient. That was awesome to see and I am really proud of her.

During our relationship i never told her about problems i faced, any negative emotions i felt or asked her for help. I could handle everything on my own. I really just needed her to be there as a partner and to bring peace (she is a chaos injector, so peace was hard to come by). 

The other day my girlfriend mentions, after a few years, she has something funny to say (she hates jokes and doesn't find anything really funny). She said, ""I just remember having a conversation with your dad and they asked me why I wanted to be with you. Your dad said you [me] have nothing I can provide. He won't be successful. He won't be rich. He isn't good looking. The only thing he has is he is loyal"". I have taken a lot of shit in my life from other people and have experienced a lot depression because of it. But hearing that this is something my dad supposedly said nearly broke me. It sent me down a bad path of depression. I became suicidal and I shut myself off from everyone for a few days. I later would confront my parents and they vehemently denied anything of the sort was said. I obviously want to believe them because they are my parents. I had reason to doubt them though and I continued to push. I pushed hard. They continued to deny the accusations. 

Yesterday, i brought it up to my girlfriend what they said and she was upset. I said, ""I have been extremely depressed the last week and I need your help. I need to sit you and my parents down together to have a conversation about what really was said"". Her immediate response was ""No i can't help you, i dont have the time"". I was shocked. This is the first time i ever asked for help. And i felt like after i reached my hand out for help she turned her back on me. I was immediately hurt. I expressed to her in a rational way how that hurts me and I continued to pleasd with her to help. She continued to deny me. After i cursed her out of anger and frustration. I hung up the phone in frustration. About 10 seconds later i call her again to apologize for cursing at her. It wasn't the adult way to handle it and i was really immature in that moment. She is crying saying how could i curse her and basically saying i am terrible and we need to break up. After talking for about an hour after this, she says, ""Fine if you want me to help you I will. But it will have to be in a couple months"". (She got a job in the admissions office at her school full time and says she doesn't have any free time because she needs time to relax with TV). She goes on to say that regardless what happens, if she talks with my parents our relationship is over because my parents will deny what she accused them of doing and she hates liars. 

I left out a lot of the failings of our relationship. I wasn't perfect and there is a lot I can improve. She felt like everything was perfect and she can't be wrong. Me addressing a problem she is causing would make her say, ""we are too different. Let's break up"". Over a small fixable problem. This was far too common to the point it was easier for me to not talk about problems because it could result in her saying let's break up. This happened last night too.",theschnipdip,1,2,1.0
114,Live service games & online only games,11ttiv5,"With Diablo IV releasing soon, i am once again reminded about how much i absolutely hate live service games and games that require a constant connection to the internet just to be able to play it. 

There have been so many games with cool & interesting ideas that have failed because they went the live service route. If they went the single player/offline route, those games would still be playable today. Now, i'm not saying that Diablo IV will fail. It won't because people are stupid enough to support them.

First of all, i have to pay full price to be able to play the game (fair enough) and then you add an in-game cash shop & battle passes. Things that you also have to pay for. 

Now i know what you're going to say, ""but you don't HAVE to pay for these"". While true, that's not the point. The point is, those things should already be obtainable for free, by actually PLAYING the game. I already gave you money to be able to play your game and now you are taking things that should've been obtainable for free, and are expecting me to pay for those. I shouldn't have to pay for cosmetic armor sets and weapons. I should be able to get those by playing your full priced game. It's a full price game, why are you presenting the real money shop like it's some feature everybody wants?

Diablo 4 Standard Edition Price - $69.99

Diablo 4 Digital Deluxe Edition Price - $89.99

Diablo 4 Ultimate Edition Price - $99.99

Imagine expecting people to buy from your in-game shop & pay for battle pass, with your game costing this much on top of it all.

There's also the problem with these types of game requiring a constant connection to the internet, otherwise you can't play it.

Imagine that, paying $70 for a video game and not being able to play because either your internet is acting up or something isn't working on their side. 

Also, what happens when the games' sales or performance are below expectations? They drop their support and now the game is dead in the water. You don't have access to the game that you paid money for. Isn't that insane? How can anyone defend this shit?

I also just don't want to deal with people. Let's be honest. People can be real assholes and sometimes you just want to get away from them, hop on a game, turn your mind off and relax. But with games like these you can't, because you're forced to play with others. I hate seeing xXfuckurmom69Xx running around my game. I hate people constantly being toxic towards other because they're either not playing the game ""correctly"" or simply because they just want to be an antagonistic asshole for no reason. And i hate having to rely on others to be able to access and enjoy certain content.

Worst of all, the same morons that support these trends are now asking for these cancerous trends to be added in every game that gets announced. Even games that simply would not work as a live service/online only type of game. Not every game needs to be Gaas damn it.

Sorry for the long rant, but these have been bothering me a lot lately. And i know that there are worse things to be upset about but i just had to get this off my chest. I hope these types of games just die off and don't ever come back. In a F2P game i can forgive some of this, at least to an extent. But in a full priced game? You can fuck right off. 

The fact that people are not only supporting, but defending these trends is honestly not that surprising. Because people are stupid.",ExtremelyEPIC,0,1,1.0

118,Work is draining me,11tquny,"I‚Äôve raised the same concern with my Manager twice now; once at the end of last year and yesterday morning and absolutely nothing has changed.

I think my workplace is genuinely affecting my mental and physical health. Every morning when I come into work I have hot flashes, like I get really overheated for about 5 minutes and cool down after, which hasn‚Äôt been a problem until these last few months. 

I work in a very small team, there are two of us who do the bulk of the work, my manager and a new person who started about a month ago. We do a completely different job to the rest of the staff and take care of them ie. do all the admin work, daily cleaning, design and help get important documents out by their deadline date for about 100+ staff across the country. 

Previously I was getting burnt out as we didn‚Äôt have that second person. I was falling asleep as early as 7pm and had no time for taking care of myself after work. This has gotten a little better that we hired the second person halfway through last year but not by much. This person doesn‚Äôt double check their work before sending it out, for example there were a ton of spelling mistakes in a document that was to be presented to our board of Directors, forgets to order stuff for the office so I need to constantly remind them and doesn‚Äôt manage their time. Recently, a deadline was almost not going to be met so in order to meet it, this person needed myself and two others to help with tasks, as well as another two people staying until midnight to get this document out on time. On top of this, so many other small mistakes are still being made almost a year into the job.

I voiced my concerns to my manager yesterday and was met with nothing back. No, I‚Äôll have a chat with them. Instead I was told to focus on myself, don‚Äôt let someone elses work pace affect mine, try to get rid of this negativity I‚Äôve been holding and that because I was a freelancer maybe its hard for me to work in a team. 

I just want to be able to find a new job and get out of here.",MishL-xo,5,9,1.0
119,Dating apps profit by making you feel bad about yourself,11tqe14,"Popular dating apps like Tinder and Bumble are manufactured with the specific intention of making you feel poorly about yourself to elicit premium subscription purchase. 

I admittedly suffer from very poor self esteem as a result of trauma. I have made the (bad) decision of paying for a Tinder subscription on multiple occasions and I‚Äôve realized a very scummy pattern on their end. 

On occasions where I have not payed for premium, I‚Äôm usually met with a stockpile of near 40 hidden likes (fairy isolated town of 100,000 people, idk how these numbers compare to big cities), after only a week. 

Most recently, I decided to make a new Tinder account and pay for premium as soon as the profile was created. My, apparently delusioned, thinking was that if there‚Äôs this many people swiping right on me, I might as well just pay so I can see them as they like my profile. 

After paying the outrageously and embarrassingly high price of premium, my profile (almost identical to previous), received only a single like in the entire week following. 

This leads me to believe, with near certainty, that Tinder intentionally withholds showing one‚Äôs profile to manifest these feelings of inadequacy and increase the odds of one paying for their service in an act of self-preserving desperation. 

Immoral business practice? Certainly. Surprising? Not in the slightest lmao. It‚Äôs the same kinda shit all social media platforms do; create a poor self-esteem based dopamine dependency. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs an unintentional byproduct of their app. They‚Äôre specifically manufactured to prey on your emotional vulnerability in the name of corporate profit.

I keep on being asked to work on days off and holidays, and yet, rarely see any fucking praise despite having implemented new services and processes that took my employer years to implement. My direct colleague on the other hand, is a lazy fuck who always arrives around 11am when he actually decides to come to work, leaves at 2pm, doesn't do shit the whole day, and all he does is to hang around the fucking coffee machine doing absolutely nothing.

125,Insufferable. Can't wait for the divorce to go through.,11tmviu,"She was reluctant to file for divorce herself because she knows how expensive it is. Even when I did it, she said she would pay half but when it actually came to it she couldn't pay me (though somehow she had enough money to travel around and buy a huge new husky). Mind you, I'm so ready to be rid of her I don't actually care to foot the bill. But now that she discovered she might get deported in a few months without more concrete divorce paperwork (which is still in the process) all of a sudden it's my fault. ""I should have just started the divorce with my attorney myself instead of trusting you.""

I tried to tell you 1.5 years prior to when we started this divorce process that we could divorce without affecting your green card status. Instead of hearing me out, you cussed me out and threatened to sue me. Then you went to see an attorney and found out for yourself. What did you do? Did you apologize? No. Did you ask to start the process? No. You decided to keep waiting for your green card status update instead to avoid me. When a year passed and nothing was progressing, and you couldn't get a driver's license to do things, THEN you approached me about starting the divorce process. Did you apologize then? Still no, like you typically do, you controlled the convo so you can steamroll past it. YOU wasted all of this time. And now that the deadline is fast approaching and you may get deported it's *MY* fault? *I'M* incompetent? Despite everything being filed and waiting for the court? And you even had the *audacity* to question if my family (who had to mail stuff for us because I was out of the country at one point) might have delayed or sabotaged this to be petty. As if my family don't have anything better to do? As if my mom doesn't want me to move on with my life, remarry and have children?

128,Most recruiters are fucking annoying and don't add anything to the recruitment process. Third-party recruitment agencies are (most of the time) leeches that have absolutely incompetent staff.,11tlp08,"So I am an IT expert in a perspective field, so I get recruitment calls pretty often and am just tired of incompetent recruiters. Most of them are young ladies who know ABSOLUTELY nothing about IT or even the position they offer.  They are usually just trying to play psychological games with you. Trying to create feelings of exclusivity, dissatisfaction and desirability. Most of the calls and DMs/emails go like this:

""R: Hello, I am xxx from xxx recruitment and we are looking for an xxx developer for an xxx corporation. Are you looking for a change?

Me: Maybe? What are you offering?

R: Work on contract for xxx. Do you have experience with xxx and xxx (Usually very broad questions while all of the info is available in great detail on my LinkedIn and this questioning usually takes several minutes)? What is your salary expectation?""

Me: What technologies are you working with, what projects do you have, what is the size of the team, what benefits are you offering and what does the job consist of?

R: Well for that I'd have to arrange an interview with the hiring manager. If you are interested I have to know your salary expectation.""

So... You can tell me nothing about the job. You can't even tell me your salary range or benefits and expect ME to tell you my price for a job you TOLD ME NOTHING ABOUT? Hell, I don't even know if I want to waste my time on this job offer and conduct an interview...

That is if they even call about the right technologies (which are again in great detail on my LinkedIn where you found me in the first place) and offer absolutely unfitting positions (managerial, high senior, or absolutely different technologies). Sometimes they don't even write the CORRECT NAME in the bulk messages they are sending.

The worst part is, that they usually ask the corporation for a commission on each of your salaries for the whole duration of the employment(so the recruitment company pays you 100 000 but gets 110 000 from the employer) while they added ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the process.

Often the workers don't even cooperate in the same company so they call you multiple times for the same opportunity and some of the agencies even work in an MLM-like fashion.

I get multiple calls like these a week and it is just so tiring. I don't want to turn down the opportunity because it can genuinely be a good opportunity but the calls are so tedious and I'd appreciate not wasting my time on interviews when most of the opportunity filtering can be done on a call with the recruiter if they were even a little bit professional and informed. This way I just feel like a piece of meat being traded on a meat market.

It is a rarity to find a good recruiter (who usually works directly for the company) who can tell me about the position, benefits and the company) and I am just so much more open to listening to what they have to offer.

Companies. PLEASE get your own qualified recruiters. A recruiter is the first contact of a candidate with your company and if you try to hire me through an incompetent 3rd party recruiter, it just tells me that you potentially don't give a shit about your employees (which doesn't always have to be true) and are just looking for a piece of meat.

From the ages of 3-11 I was abused and molested by a neighbour girl (a year older than me) and her parents. I have only recently reported it after the memory burst intonky kind one day as a barrage of flashbacks.

I survived!

From primary school to the very end of highschool so 5-16 I was bullied relentlessly. Physically and verbally I was treated like an animal someone hated. I had very few true friends and only one of them went to my highschool.

It's thanks to those freinds I have survived to this day.

From 11-16 I was molested by a man 5 years older than me. This was an almost daily occurance and he had a girl my age and a disabled girl with the mental age of a 5 year old join in. The guy and the girl my age would teach her what to do to md. The poor girl had no idea that she was torturing me because she thought it was a game.

I survived.

Age 12 a girl in school kicked me so hard in the stomach she caused my appendix to swell to the point I needed it removed. Then when I returned to school 3 girls ganged up on me and kicked the stitches out of me.

I literally survived someone's attempt to kill me.

Age 16 I lost my virginity to a man who was 23. He was too rough and left me bleeding for a week. I tried to get out of the relationship because he was a neo Nazi but he wouldn't let me leave. I finally got the courage to leave after I find out he is sleeping with my 13 year old cousin. He then went on to murder a man for being gay a year later. The body wasn't found for years, so I found out when I was 21. I had to give him a character reference and give the police a statement describing losing my virginity, every horrid painful gruesome detail. This was then read out in court. 

I still survived 

Still at 16 I found out I have a life long condition that will only get worse for the rest of my life. It is the first of many. 

I'm still surviving through the pain caused by this daily. I now have over 20 conditions and they're life altering. I am an electric wheelchair user because of constant dislocations. I can dislocated a shoulder or a hip just by sleeping funny.

Age 18-19 I was in a physically abusive with a 27 year old. He beat me to the point my joints would dislocate from my body. I only left him because I was forced to by freindsz after he beat me in my workplace so badly my whole left side was dislocated (shoulder, hip, knee, elbow and wrist). My friends wouldn't let me go back to the first home I ever rented. 

Thanks to my parents and friends I got through that.

19 I was sexually assaulted by a freinds flat mate when I tried to leave their house. He grabbed me and dragged me into the room and threatened people's safety if I screamed. The flat mates were all disabled except him. I believed he would hurt them. The police didn't believe me because ""no-one heard anything ""

I almost didn't survive that. 

19 again I met a 30 year old man who taught me what swinging was. He included tricking me into sleeping with people older than my own parents. The swinging was fun but kicked off a sex addiction which lead to me sleeping with over 300 men and women combined. He took me on expensive dates and bought me presents but wouldn't let me meet his son. I just this moment realised now I was a sugar baby and just didn't bloody know it! Anyway one day he came to pick me up for a swingers party and I was trying out a wheelchair as part of my physio and I was practicing in the dorm common room which had all around windows. He saw me through the window, made a face, dropped the roses he bought me and left. He later text me saying he ""COULDN'T SEE ME AS SEXY ANYMORE BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET THAT IMAGE OUT OF HIS HEAD!""

Screw that guy but I survived him and learned swinging is more fun in my control.

TRIGGER WARNING SUICIDE DISCUSSED A LOT AFTER THIS.

Age 20 I took two overdoses as I couldn't handle everything that happened in my life so far. The first one caused my heart to stop and it had to be restarted.i was drunk out of my mind, I drank 2L of rum before I left the house (I still can't drink rum to this day) I remember nothing between passing out and waking up. I had an out of body experience during the OD, watching myself take the pills from across the room. As soon as the last pill (54) was in my mouth I snapped back into reality and regretted my decision. 
Also during the OD recovery period I was allergic to one of the IV medications and nobody noticed me going into anaphylaxis. My mum came for a visit and Found me swollen and unable to breathe. The nurses had a change over and the new nurses just thought I was fat. 
The second wasn't as many pills but I had drank three bottles of wine, a freind of mine slept with the guy I liked after I asked her to introduce me. I was in earshot. I rifled through the guys cupboards and found and took every pill I could find. Which fortunately was not enough. And again after the frenzy I snapped back into reality, I called one of my best friends (she was my maid of honour) and she drove as fast as she could breaking speed limits to come and get me. She drove my ass to the hospital to get my stomach pumped.

Thanks to my freinds, my quick thinking once my right mind kicked in, my mum for saving me from an ironic death and especially the ambulance staff and the doctors who literally brought me back to life. I survived.

Age 20 I meet my son's father. We were together for four years. During this time we became engaged and set our wedding date, bought the dress, spent ¬£10k on a wedding in a castle. He ended things while I was in hospital on life support. But let's rewind just a little bit, from day one I told him that my condition would worsten throughout my life and had many comorbidities (conditions it can cause) and I would deteriorate. We decide to have a baby sooner rather than later as the older I am the less likely I am to survive pregnancy. I go through pregnancy aged 21-22 with my son with a 3% chance of survival, this dropped to a 0.01% if I have a C-section. I went through 3 days of full blown labor with no dialation. The doctors had never seen anything like it before (this will be explained soon). 

I survived a C-section after the most painful labour for three freaking days! Thanks once again to amazing skilled doctors and nurses, HCAs and other hospital staff!

Age 22 diagnosed with a 1-1million medical condition that causes bones to fuse wrong. I have an open fontanelle but fused pieces in my spine and a FUSED PELVIS! This is why I didn't dialate! It was physically impossible as my pelvis couldn't move to adjust. It was also why I suffered massive pelvic pain at the final trimester.

I'm surviving despite this and all my other conditions!

Age 24 I feel a pain in my chest and I am struggling to breathe. I ask my fianc√©, the father of my child to drive me to the hospital. He says no because he will be late to his new job (my brother in law was his boss) so I push my manual wheelchair to the bus stop slowly but surely. I make it to the bus stop and promptly collapse to the floor. I wake up surrounded by people, all neighbours who knew me from the estate. They had a blanket around me and a pillow under me, they asked me where I lived and I whispered the number while pointing down the road. They ran and got my fianc√©. He gets there just after I am loaded into the ambulance, he asks if I Will be okay, the paramedics shared a look and said they didn't know. They asked if he was coming and he said he was going to work and walked away without so much as an ""I love you"". I find out my lungs are coated in blood clots and had to undergo procedures to break them down. I couldn't breathe alone and couldn't talk. He waited 3 days before coming to the hospital didn't call once to check if was okay either, he then sat across from me and said this exact phrase ""I CAN'T HANDLE YOUR HEALTH ANYMORE!"" and called off our marriage and told me not to come home. Not to come home to my home, in my name, adapted for my needs as a wheelchair user.  So when I was ready for release out of the hospital I was asked my address for the ambulance drop off and I had a breakdown. I didn't have an address to give them. I had to call my mum and ask her to take me in. She opened her home to me and my son, though I moved into a friend's house after a week for my mental health. I lived with my friend for 6 months with my baby in a travel cot. This was my first time being homeless. I had to find a house for me and my baby. I finally did but we have now moved 5 x in 8 years.

 I survived another health scare and the end of the life I had planned ahead with the first man who had treated me right.

Age 25 my son's dad met a new girl, she has become my son's step mother and my ex's wife. I'm fine with her these days but back then I wasn't because of overstepping boundaries from her. Admittedly I'll thank her for this, my son's dad hadn't seen him in 8 months because he didn't want to see me. She told him ""if you don't start acting like a dad I'm never giving you kids"" unfortunately they then fought for full custody and I got supervised only visits. My son's dad acted like my conditions were worse than I let on.

I survived this and now have full shared custody. Though his dad takes him if I am in hospital or too ill.

Age 25 I meet my soulmate. He is the most kindhearted, warmest, sweetest, caring, most wonderful souls in the universe. The yin to my yang. My everything. We were a swinging duo to be envied. I loved everything about him and he was the perfect other half. If I could turn back time I would have never left. I would hog tie the old me in a basement and throw away the key to live a lifetime with him on my arm. Anyway not the point, the point is I royally fucked up. I suddenly had an urge to go back to uni again in the place I was assaulted. I saw it as an opportunity to face my past and get over my trauma (spoiler alert it didn't work)!. So off I move 100 miles away from everything. Including my son. Yeah I had a psychotic break I'm pretty sure after all the stress my son's dad caused.

I survived this with so much regret.


27I meet my soon to be ex husband. We met online, had a whirlwind romance where we were living together in 2 weeks and married at 5 months in. The first year and a half of marriage was bliss, then c-19 hit. Suddenly we were stuck together 24/7 which to begin with was great, then we both became depressed and frustrated, but he took.his frustration out on me. He withheld sex, using it as a weapon, started insulting me, ingraining into me that I was ugly, stupid, fat, lazy etc. A few times he has thrown stuff at me including a concrete hand casting kit. I finally left this year.

Now I must concentrate on surviving through every day.

30 left my abusive ex husband but had to live in the same house as him. The day after I told him things were over he sexually assaulted me in the early morning. I was forced to report it to the police when I broke down crying in my doctor's office. 

I'm still surviving...

31 I finally got help from the homelessness team in my old area. I've been living in hotels for weeks and my ex husband is still abusing me from a distance guilt tripping me about my stuff taking up room, or our dog or anything he can come up with. 

I will get through this! I AM A SURVIVOR!

Now this is a message for me. If you are reading this, you are doing enough, you are worth it, ask your freinds for help, you are beautiful, you are outgoing, you are an amazing mother, you do deserve love, you deserve to be happyn

Keep on surviving!!",xxasynixxx,0,2,0.75
137,"So I was using a hotel a few weeks ago, I used the hotel gym and the spa/sauna along with the swimming pool... A mother I just met thought it was fine to leave her kid with me unmonitored for 43 minutes what the...?",11tbitf,"As it says. I was staying in another city so i'm using the gym there after I decided to do a swim before I used the hot tub... Anyway when I jumped in the pool it was empty I was just gonna do 15 minutes or so to cool down when a woman comes in with her child no big deal at all I thought... She instantly tries to start up conversation with me asking if the pool is warm etc. Just bit of small talk the kid laughs giggles and says something about me reminding her of john cena, i'd guess the kid was about 7-9 area (this is a mild guess though) The kid is very nice and makes a lot of comments in the pool. after about 4 minutes if that the mother goes hey you don't mind if I just leave her with you while I go get something from my room or something like that.... No this is not a fucking joke...

&#x200B;

I said eh what? Not really tbh you don't really know me not really safe to leave her do you think? She said something inauidible she's only been soaking her toes in the pool and just begins walking off.... So i'm like what the fuck??? The kid doesn't seem distressed which indicates to me this happens often.

&#x200B;

I mean this girl has met me for less then 5 minutes and left her kid alone in a pool with me??? I could be king of the nonces for all she knows, Obviously i'm not but you know what im getting at?? I talk to the kid and im nice to her but a bit furious and I thought i'm gonna have a proper go when she gets back, I Look at my phone. No word of a lie after about 20 mins pass the mother is not back?!?!? I started wondering if I should alert staff or what the fuck should I do. I check my phone again 36 minutes. so i'm thinking to myself has this lass just like left her kid with me or is she coming back whats going on. anyway eventually she comes back (It's been 43 mins give or take from what I can work out) I've actually made the kid laugh and bonded to some degree in my attempt to keep her safe while also thinking wtf is going on.

Mother comes back ""Oh im sorry love"" I said long 5 minutes eh? Said it very nasty/rude but she some how seems oblivious to that ""Oh did you have fun millie with chris"" I'm like what the fuck... I said bye to the kid and left the pool while just starring at the mother who has her feet dipping back into the pool while on her phone. Ended up going to the hot tub. But obviously poor kid she must be neglected to kingdom come. who in their right mind would do that?",BodybuilderChris2023,2,2,1.0

142,I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs going to get back with his ex,11t8kxo,"I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; I'd just watch the videos.

A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers, but whenever I'd watch his videos, a few hours later, my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days; eg. I'd watch his videos one day, watch it two days later, then the day after, and each time I saw them, my views went up, and on the days that I didn't watch them, they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Now, it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time, he even posted a TikTok in English (English isn't his first language, and all of his previous videos were in his native language).

TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time, I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later, he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English, and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny, but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.

However, twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up, he started following her on TikTok, but unfollowed her within a few hours (probably because she didn‚Äôt follow him back). A month later, one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on, he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok, because TikTok tells who looks at your profile. I don‚Äôt post much, and he looks at it every two to three days.",Educational-Let-1027,1,1,0.66

144,My husband and I have trauma and it's breaking us,11t87cx,"My husband and I didn't have the best upbringing. Lots of domestic violence surrounded us both up until we got married. This morning my 2 year old son was having a tantrum, just the usual terrible two's etc. It went on for about 10 mins until my husband lost it on him, i wont go into detail but it was very out of character for my husband. Som was fine, he just went into a worse tantrum. In the moment I knew husband had messed up and husband also knew he had messed up. His reaction instantly made me go rigid and start shivering without knowing. It is worth saying he is normally very patient and a clown and doesn't let things bother him. I took baby downstairs and husband left for work. He sent me a text apologising and explaining that my sons crying just took him back to a dark place in his childhood. I told him his reaction took ME to a dark place in my childhood. He's apologised profusely but I haven't replied. We're both defeated and are giving in. How do we overcome the childhood trauma? We're at such low points, both of us. It's the past that's instilled in us so deep that we don't know how to navigate anything now. Please don't tell me to leave him or get authortites involved, he's not a bad person, husband or father.

145,This makes me sad,11t7c25,"This year I will be living in another country outside the USA. and thinking about it is incredibly depressing too me the USA has been my home for 20 years now since I was born all my friends and the family I care for is  here. All my most cherished memories is here and now I will have too leave it cause our government don't care for us except the rich and especially the rich white. They don't care about the shootings, not giving us free healthcare, removing guns from citizens, the racism, the political divide, the toxic work culture, POC specifically non black Hispanics and black people  having too be scared of cops instead of feeling safe around them, The threat of being caught in a mass shooting, the wages not matching the pricing of rising food, rent, home price cost, gas cost, the terrible walkability of majority of the cities in this country and terrible public transportation . These are all the reasons why I'm leaving the USA forever cause I know no matter how much we protest or vote we won't ever have it as good like a lot of other countries. So the best way I can save myself is by leaving if the USA turns out the way I want it I might come back who knows but it's been almost 250 years since the USA formed and barely anything has changed and changed for the worse.

This is kinda long,

This last 2 weeks I've been feeling bad, like anxious over everything, no motivation most of the time, I'm really conflicted about my emotions in various levels, I'm not someone to just spill all I feel to other people cuz I don't want to burden them and because a lot of the time I feel like it's not as important as it is, yesterday after taking some desicions and my overthinking getting the better of me I ended up in a bad spot, and really needed to talk to someone about what was going on with everything, so I texted my two friends from school (note that we aren't on school anymore, we are university students and each one has their own career path on different universities).

I asked one if he could hear me out for a while cuz I needed some help, he said he was busy, if it could be tomorrow, I said ok I understand, then I asked my other friend through ig (I was evading WhatsApp at the time) and she never opened my messages.

After a while I finally calmed down and texted a friend from university, she heard me out and helped me through my stuff, so everything was ok from then, but now, the next day after that, the friend that told me to talk to him the next day never checked on me again even tho I told him it was important (and no, he is not busy cuz his university just got on strike so all work is paused) and is just sending memes, and my other friend who didn't even open my ig messages just posted on her stories and proceeded to text me on WhatsApp cuz ""OMG my boyfriend just posted my pictures on his stories, isn't he cute?"" And I'm like, bro, yesterday I was in the middle of a breakdown and you never responded, you got into Instagram and published new stuff and now text me to just show off your boyfriend?? Not even check if I needed to talk cuz, well, I texted you last night asking that explicitly?

Now, I don't wanna be self centered or anything, they have their own lifes, they have their own stuff, I can't expect them to prioritize me over what they are doing at the moment they receive the messages, but I feel hurt, every time they needed me to listen to their problems and help them through them I did, and when I need help, when I finally need to open up after keeping too much inside they just, don't care, don't pay attention, and just continue talking like nothing is happening.

I'm just really sad, I need some insight to know if I'm exaggerating or if what I feel is justified, maybe it's childish, I don't know, I just know that it's hurting me right now and not helping my anxiety at all.

Two years ago, I became a pandemic specialist. I joined a group of pandemic specialists and we handled outbreaks in all types of facilities including the local hospitals in our health district. Last year, we were officially absorbed by the local health district. They promised that our role is permanent and that our job is to minimise hospital acquired infection and control outbreaks of any kind.

This Monday, they told us they're letting us go. They know they can't fire us so they want us to work in other departments. They wanted us to pick a department and make a final decision by Wednesday.

We were all shocked as it was too abrupt and there was no transition period. I bought a property recently. Before I bought it, I considered everything. The type of job that I have, my pay, and my financial status. My plan was derailed in an instant and now they want me to choose immediately. They want me to change my career that I planned for myself in an instant because they want us to start in other departments next week.

I had a hunch when my previous manager resigned early this year. My new manager (well, now my previous manager as well), is conveniently on a 2-week holiday. No transition program, no clear direction, no formal letter was given to our team or to any of us.

We were betrayed and we are being driven out asap. We're being treated as dispensable workers by executives whose job is to sit in their offices and earn 120 to 200k a year.

170,I don't want this anymore,11su2rr,"I am a bi dude, student at a university in Romania. For some background, initially I was disillusioned with engineering so I dropped it and went onto political science, because I thought i'd like it. But here is the kicker, i joined pol sci because I wanted to meet politically literate people, while there might be some, they are the exception, some teachers are straight up christo-fascists, historical revisionists, antisemites, homophobic, transphobic and with all manner of bigotry, two teachers stand out in this aspect, the english teacher and the history teacher, they're both antisemitic pieces of shit, they recommend lectures from fucking conspiracy theorists and fascist simpatizers, Alex Jones, FUCKING ALEX JONES, was cited by our history teacher. Just today the english teacher was showing us a documentary about ""the evil satanists"" and ""the cabal that controls the world"". Besides it being a load of fucking nonsense, it relies on the viewer being a christofascist POS to believe it, I am not that since I don't believe in any deity. Now onto the other problem, my colleagues, they just don't care, I wish I was like them, but I cannot in my right mind tolerate fucking alt-right propaganda IN THE FUCKING CLASSROOM, at a POLITICAL SCIENCE faculty. When I show these concerns of mine, my colleagues just play it off as ""oh it's just another opinion"" or ""oh it's just another belief"", and how when I attack religion as the basis of the teacher's argument, I am attacking them also, because they're believers also. If it's another opinion or belief, WHY THE FUCK SHOULD I CARE? WHY IS IT TAUGHT?

More and more problems arise, I addressed these problems to a teacher who is actually nice, twice, and he was agreeing something needs to change, but nothing has been done since.

I am out to my mom, and she constantly invalidates my existance as bi, and she always backs off from a serious discussion about her biases with a ""I was grown with these values"". I get it, coming to terms with you kid not being straight takes time, thanks to this heterosexism that is the norm. But at some point she'll have to choose between me and her shitty ""values"".

Another thing about my mom, when I was little, idk if she was realizing it or not, she was trying to indoctrinate me into christianity, by going to church even though i didn't want to, she was showing me a fucking cultist that was saying that ""modern technology is turning your kids into demons"" or some bs. Basically she was subscribing to this christofascist ideas too.

And now the thing that made me write this rant in the first place, I was telling my mom about these shitty teachers constantly, to the point she got fed up with it, but instead of blaming the teachers she blames me. Today, after all that bullshit at the english course, which I would honestly call it ""alt-right indoctrination session"" and indirectly being invalidated because both of these teachers think queer people are possessed, or have something wrong with them, or worse, that we are the product of the ""globalist cabal to depopulate the world"" and how anything that says otherwise is basically ""tainted science"" by an ""evil ideology"". Basically a self-sealing conspiracy theory about ""New World Order"" bullshit, promoted at a FUCKING UNIVERSITY, WITH NOTHING TO BACK IT UP BECAUSE IT'S JUST NONSENSE, and when you call out these teachers they become INCREDIBLY hostile, The history teacher said how he's against historical revisionism, and I wanted to continue on that idea, and so I said how one of our country's most beloved writer ""Octavian Goga"" was also a fascist politican that had a political party who was just antisemitic, and he deadass replied ""He wasn't a fascist, this is just anti-romanian lies and propaganda"" He was also denying the genocide against jewish people, he's the equivalent of a german holocaust denier but for Romania.  The english teacher was talking about christian and muslim views on Jesus, and I, wanting to stir the pot because I had nothing better to do, said ""Ok what about the perspective of Jesus being an impostor"" basically, I said the jewish perspective to see her reaction and OH BOY, was it bad, (her being an antisemitic piece of shit doesn't help) she started shouting at me on ""how do you know it? you weren't there"", this is of course, extremely ironic and when I call out her bullshit, my colleagues started being annoyed at ME, I am sorry, this is just my ""opinion"" deal with it, you know like that ""opinion"" these christofascist teachers have about gay people, that being, that they shouldn't exist.

I voiced all these concers to my mom (big mistake) and it devolved into her threatening to out me to my dad, so that he can ""deal with it"" (it being my sexuality), and from there it all went downhill, I started screaming, hitting and shouting at her for all the bullshit I am going through and how she doesn't fucking care and does not approach these situations well, her first reaction to voicing my concerns is ""why do you care so much?"", ""i have no issues with anyone, why do you?"" this being in the context of the CHRISTOFASCIST teachers. These teachers that glorify the fucking fascists of this country and are willing to lie and revision history because they think it is ""anti-romanian"" to address ROMANIAN FASCISM AND THE GENOCIDE UNDER IT

The thing I hate the most is this, both my parents were telling me that ""oh you dropped from engineering, you'll drop from the next thing also"" and I wanted to prove them wrong, but they might be right, obviously for a very bullshit reason, I DO NOT TOLERATE FASCISTS TEACHING, all of this is taking a toll on my mental health, I was diagnosed with depression months ago, so that doesn't help, and I am thinking of quitting, but I don't know what to do from there, and I am honestly scared living in this country, I want to move out but I don't know when I'll be able to.

I grew up in Spain and I was bullied there for being a ""stealing romanian"" and I was hoping my life would be better here because I won't be bullied on the basis of nationality, but, in time, I learned that this country is a shithole in all aspects, I do not care about your ""traditional values"" when they exist to erase my rights and existance, I do not care about your religion when it's weaponized against queer people. And so with all this it seems like I have no place to call home, I feel like nationality is a dangerous construct and is inherently a bad thing, In Spain i was rejected for being romanian, in Romania i am rejected because i am queer, i am tired about all of it.

TL:DR Queer guy that has been living with religious trauma tired of all the apathetic people around him that enable christofascist teachers to disseminate far-right propaganda and discriminate queer people.

I ask you out - you refuse because it's to much to handle - faire enough.

If I complain how something has been hard, you get hyper defensive and make us feel bad because we have NO IDEA what hard is....you always have it worse than any of us.

Everyone has to be aware of anything they say as it might either trigger you or it is per defacto political incorrect and that makes us bad humans for that. But hey, when we call you out on the same you are offended and are not allowed to have fun...

You wanna know about all the fun things they've done, share some of your own crazy stories and tonight's the night because who knows when the schedule gods will allow you to meet again.

After a while, the conversation turns serious, you discuss your life issues, your financial problems, break ups, new jobs, moving towns, etc. But seriousness can only last for so long because someone cracks a joke and it's all back to fun and sharing crazy stories.

Then someone utters the blasted phrase: ""Yo, guys, I got this new board game, I've never played it, let's try it.""

Criticizing people who are trying their best to be more plant based. They act like if they aren‚Äôt fully vegan, might as well not even bother. My philosophy is, as long as your trying, your making a difference. I encourage people to include more plant based options in their diet. It‚Äôs better for the planet, your health and of course the animals. If the entire population of the US are plant based for just half of their meals, there would already be tremendous impact

But bullying people into veganism almost never works. 

I remember at one point I got heavily criticized by my vegan Facebook group for buying a leather belt at a local store after my belt broke just a half hour before my work shift. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve went to other stores‚Äù. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not vegan‚Äù. Etc.  as if I had a choice.

Or another time when my dad brought me back a purse from Qatar that happened to be made of suede. Told me I should donate it or ‚Äúreturn it‚Äù girl how am I gonna return this?? And my dad bought is specially for me. I‚Äôm not just gonna give to away. Isn‚Äôt that wasteful??

There was a period of time where I wasn‚Äôt plant based. I had broken my arm, had to get surgery and was in a cast for nearly three months. It was my dominant hand so I really couldn‚Äôt cook and obviously couldn‚Äôt work or drive myself to the store. So I had to eat what my parent had, which for the most part wasn‚Äôt vegan. And they were having financial trouble so I wasn‚Äôt about to ask them to make special meals. They were taking care of me. But again I was criticized by vegans online. 


They also seem to forget that not everyone has access to vegan foods. Some people live in food deserts where the only things around are convenience store and fast food places. And many don‚Äôt have vegan options. Or people simply can‚Äôt afford a plant based diet. And while they argue that cheap things like beans and rice are vegan, whose just gonna live on beans and rice?? Idk what I would do if I didn‚Äôt have access to morning star or beyond meat.

183,Colleges saying your GPA doesn't define you is a lie!!,11sjmz9,"I was going through some things I don't wanna talk about in my first 2 years of college. Basically I went from a 3.8 GPA in high school to a 2.3 GPA in college. I'm mostly better now and am working towards getting more help. 

Due to me failing 3 classes, I was unable to switch from general engineering to my specific engineering major. And now that I'm certain I can get back in my academic swing I'm applying for computer science/engineering/computing, I was talking to the advisors about my application and degree plan so I can still graduate in 2025. And instead of plans to get me to my destination I was met with all of them telling me my G.P.A was too low and I have no chance at getting into any of the majors. 

No matter who I went to they basically told me that engineering may not be for me. all because my G.P.A was low. Like, I wasn't partying or getting drunk, I barely hung out with friends all past 2 years and when I did catch up to the content I understood it pretty well I was just very behind and I barely indulged in my hobbies. I will admit I had shitty attendance but that's not because I was slacking of or anything I was just in a bad place at the time.

Now I've finally gotten the help I needed, none of the administrators actually care about anything but my G.P.A. I basically have to settle for any engineering program that will take me if I get rejected or I need to write ""some incredible essays"" If I even want a shot at having my application hollistically reviewed. 

How am I supposed to write an essay explaining how I'm not too stupid to do engineering with only 250 words!!!

Now everytime I see those anti suicide posters saying your grade doesn't matter or they don't define you it literally feels like a slap in the face because your grades do define you. There's literally so many things I can't do because of my GPA and even if I retake the class and get an A or B the old grade I got still drags down my GPA so it's like they don't even care if you learn from your mistakes. I'm so angry, I feel so hopeless cause I don't know if I'll get into the major i want this semester and I hate the idea of having to settle for a shitty major I don't want cause I don't want to get kicked out of the engineering program for not specifying which engineering I'm going to.

190,"I don‚Äôt like my dad‚Äôs wife, and I feel like I‚Äôm being pushed out of our home.",11sgmz7,"For some quick context: 
I am 19 
I work part time, but earn ¬£1200 a month. At the moment I am currently applying for full time jobs.
The bills I have to pay every month add up to ¬£375, this does not include subscriptions, or my monthly petrol cost. 
My mother died when I was very young, my dad entered a 9 year relationship a month after her death, and had a new girlfriend two months after his split with his gf of 9 years. He is now married again, after only being in a relationship for a year. 

Me & my dad have a rocky-ish relationship. We love each other very much, but we both have the same argumentative attitudes and we are both stubborn. So when we do fight, it‚Äôs not very good. 

Over the past few months I have been saving some of my wage towards buying a house in the future, I wanted to continue with my education so I would also need to work less hours as-well to get the relevant qualifications for the career I want. I only started saving for a house, because my dad told me in 3 or 4 years he wanted to sell his house. I was okay with this because I‚Äôm getting older so I have to leave at some point, and also because he has arthritis so he is struggling with the stairs. 

Last year my dads new, at the time, girlfriend moved in along with her son. It was awkward because I‚Äôd only ever met her son once or twice and now he lived in my house. 
I worked 50 hour weeks from I was 16 until I was 18, and because I wasn‚Äôt in school I had to pay my dad some rent money. So I give my dad ¬£160 on the 24th of every month, and I have never missed paying him. No one else in my house gives my dad the rent money he asks for, apart from me. 

The stranger that lives in my house is a good 6 years older than me, and doesn‚Äôt have a job. He sleeps all day and plays XBOX all night. If I get up to use the bathroom, my dads wife says I have woken her up and will complain all day about it. What I don‚Äôt understand is, her sons bedroom is right beside theirs and she doesn‚Äôt hear him screaming at his Xbox all night. I have slept through a riot, in which people were screeching and throwing petrol bombs, but I do not sleep through this dude yelling at a mic all night. His shouting wakes me up at-least once a night, but when I say something about it it‚Äôs brushed under the rug. 

Then last week my dad tells me he‚Äôs selling the house this year, so I need to move out. I‚Äôm really bummed out because I wanted to BUY a house, but now I will need to rent because my savings aren‚Äôt adequate and it‚Äôs such short notice. His wife is being really passive aggressive about it, and basically turns everything into a weird argument. The other day I said there was no chips in the freezer so she turned round and said I wouldn‚Äôt need to worry because there would be plenty in my own house. Anytime I have a shower she says it‚Äôs disgusting and I haven‚Äôt cleaned it and she knows it was me because there is fake tan in the shower. I don‚Äôt wear fake tan, I‚Äôm literally pasty as hell.

Now they are telling me I need to get rid of everything in my bedroom, and rearrange all my furniture so they can take pictures. I have nowhere to live yet, and I‚Äôm upset because everything in my room I paid for. My dad has even requested I throw out all my music stuff as-well. I have 2 guitars, a bass, and a big peavy amp that I regularly use so I don‚Äôt know why I need to throw them out just because he‚Äôs selling his house. 

At night time my dads wife requests I put my car on the driveway, then parks hers behind mine and refuses to move it for me in the morning. I don‚Äôt want to be rude by saying no, because I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôll tell on me to my dad and he‚Äôll be upset with me. 

What is annoying me most about this? When they move they are only taking one person with them. Her son! Fair enough, he is unemployed, but so is one of my brothers! He also sits at home all day and plays Xbox, but he actually gets shouted at for it. 

I‚Äôm just really annoyed, I never miss my rent payments, and I‚Äôm never home to annoy anybody. I‚Äôve never had a gap in my employment history, and I‚Äôm not a freeloader. I‚Äôm the only one out of the 4 of us children in the house with a driving license, and my dad is just like welp Gluck. 

They keep telling me to just move out and get a house with my boyfriend, but they‚Äôre not taking into consideration that he does not want to move out right now. He‚Äôs shit out of luck in his very deep overdraft, and I am helping him to get himself out of it. He is switching jobs in 2 weeks to one that is a lower paying wage because they‚Äôll put him through his apprenticeship, so we just cannot afford it even together. 

I feel like I‚Äôm too young to take this on, and I‚Äôm sick of my dad throwing me off the deep end because he said no one helped him when he was younger. I don‚Äôt mean in terms of money, like just how to do basic adulting tasks. 

I‚Äôm so fed up. I‚Äôm sick of his wife telling lies about me, and just making stuff difficult. On a weeknight I am never home later than 10pm because of work, and if my dad isn‚Äôt home she will tell him I didn‚Äôt come home until like 3AM. Why would you lie about that?",sheselectr1c,1,5,0.86

If I have to enforce that they wear the proper slip resistant shoes, they challenge me (I can understand it's rough economically right now, but I'm just doing my job). I always give people the days off that they request because I know they have lives, but it does not seem to matter what I do, some of these people use me as a punching bag.

210,Seems like I completed (almost) everything and I don't know how to enjoy things,11rzhjb,"PREMISE: I'm not here to flex anything, everything I write it's just to understand me better.

I'm **(27,m**), I finished my studies in **Computer Engineering 4 years ago** and I started working some months before, in IT field. Currenly I'm working as a freelance, earning a decent amount, I have no economic problems at all. I decided this way to be more free in my work.

I have a **house** with low mortgage since 3 years, a city **car**, I also found a **best friend** I can trust, I literally go outside with him everyday in the evening, and we laugh a lot. I even **workout** and have a decent body (can be better, I'm working on it, for myself).

I **should be happy** maybe, I don't know. But everyday it's like filling hours with things, just to pass hours, like they are coping methods.

**I don't have real hobbies**, that I feel like ""yo, X hours passed, so fast, it means I'm enjoying this a lot"", or like there is any kind of progression.

**I don't have objectives** at the moment, it seems like I completed them 4 years ago when I finished my studies and started working. I'm not someone who seeks in being rich, and so trying to have more and more money, I ""enjoy"" little things, just what I need to go out with friends and pay the monthly things, like mortgage.

*My typical day is like*: I workout in the morning in the gym (or it's free day, since I go just 4 days per week), I have the morning meal prepared by me, I start working but I don't concentrate, maybe I finish doing almost nothing the entire day, and the other day I need to rush to recover the work. Maybe I watch videos, reels, chat with online friends, playing 20-30 minutes, to fill that time I'm not working. When it's like 5/6 p.m., my real free time arrives. I don't know how to fill it, so I try to do random things, just to pass time. Dinner time, and after I go out with my friend.

Now there is also a girl, so the example below can fit, but since she broke up recently, I can't do anything properly.

For example: When I find a girl a like, my day is based on that. I can't focus on anything else, I have difficulties also in working, like it's my only objective, and I need to ""develop"" that objective, day per day, instead of living my life, and it should be a ""plus"". If the thing goes ok and we start dating, it's like I'm nullifying my life because it's already complete, and I need to focus on her like, to make her happy (not in a pathological way).

I don't know **how I can enjoy my life** with the things I have, with finding hobbies I really like, and get new objectives, instead of thinking that I completed life.",ontech7,0,1,1.0

It fucked her up so much, she couldn‚Äôt talk about it for ages. 

There is a lot of stories like that, and everyone just stopped talking about it because the police doesn‚Äôt do anything, because he‚Äôs mentally ill, and he said he has 20+ diagnosis and that‚Äôs why he does the thing he does

215,"Maryland drivers, what the hell is your problem?",11rvd3h,"I've lived in various US states and foreign countries my entire life. California, Florida, across the Midwest, even a little bit of the Northeast, some far away island countries. It's fair to say I've seen bad drivers, or at least a different ""social contract"" of driving. But Maryland? God you guys are the worst fucking drivers I have ever had the displeasure of sharing the roads with in my entire life. You somehow combine all the aggression, idiocy, selfishness and nonchalance of all of the worst places I've ever driven.

Maryland is the Australia of driving: everyone on the streets is trying to kill you. 

You don't use turn signals, ever. Like, fuck. They're literally free. Just fucking use them. Don't cut me off at 2 feet in front of my car after just now deciding to change lanes.

You don't a shit about anyone around you and speed along like it's fucking Forza Motorsport. Guess what? We're both getting to that light at the same goddamn time. Now you see racers and weavers and hotrodders everywhere, but in Maryland it is quite literally a daily occurence.

I'm not even sure what you think of lanes, because it seems like the separation of lanes is a mere suggestion rather than a rule. Oh, and you include the shoulder as a lane. The left lane is I guess for everyone else, and the right lane is for you to speed and pass on, like literally no one else in the country does.

One more thing: [This is me every single day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRjCOZ2z8dM) Because somehow you riding my bumper on a multilane highway is going to get us there faster. Because it'll move the car in front of me faster. I give a respectable one car distance between me and the car in front of me, but you? You're all up in my shit and I'm tired of it. One of these days I'm going to break check you and send you flying through your windshield. 

I should probably add that I can't even keep the one car distance anymore and have to inch just a little closer so one of you idiots doesn't try and cut me off, because sure I'll slam on my breaks so you can decide to change lanes (without a turn signal I bet).

221,I was ghosted by the man I was talking to for a year and I don‚Äôt know what to feel about it.,11rse1b,"I met this guy online a year ago and we had been talking ever since. We live a thousand miles apart. I wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship, I was just looking for online friends. After a few days of constantly talking, I felt a connection that we started to flirt to each other. This went on for months. Talking and flirting here and there. We would also talk on phone almost every night but the constant calls happened a few months before the year ended. 

At first, I thought he just liked talking to me and liked to have fun and that he doesn‚Äôt plan to take this seriously. One day, he told me he had plans on visiting my country and meet up with me. So I was like, this guy must be really serious about me that he wanted to fly to my country to see me. At that time, I had already developed feelings for him but it got deeper when I learned about his plan. His plan to see me based on what he told me, never happened. I asked him about it then he said it would be at the end of the month. I tried to shrug it off because I was thinking that maybe he was just joking. But our communication never stopped. After that, I noticed he was becoming distant‚Äîslow replies, not too eager to talk to me anymore, and he would take days to respond but that also didn‚Äôt stop me from having feelings for him. 
Then on December, he told me he would really come by January. Mid-December, he was showing disinterest in me by not texting me that often, not calling anymore, not reading my messages and he would only text back once a week. I asked him what was wrong, he said it‚Äôs all good, he was just really busy with work and life. 
I tried my best not to get affected. 
New year came, he sent me wishes and called me a week after. I texted him after that, then he responded one week after as well. It really made me sad because he was giving me false hope and made me think that I was just overthinking. He is a straightforward type of person but he can‚Äôt even straight up tell me that he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore. 
I had already fallen for him and it made things worse for me. At the end of January, he completely ghosted me. His last text to me was I shouldn‚Äôt stress anything and I was just overthinking. 

It‚Äôs been a month and a half and I still get crushed every time I think about it. It made me feel worthless and made me think that I am undeserving of any explanation. It would not be a big deal to me if we had been only talking for a short time but we kept in touch for a year and he was leading me on all this time. I thought he was serious about me.

228,You will never understand what being fat is like until you actually are,11ro18g,"I've seen a lot of posts and comments that go something like ""I would never be obese, I care too much about how I look in the mirror, and I get uncomfortable being just a little overweight"" or something like that.

The simple fact is, losing weight (especially when you're already obese) is really hard.

I was obese up until last year. I absolutely hated it. I looked myself in the mirror every day and hated my appearance. I had tried to lose weight multiple times but nothing ever worked. It only changed when one day I went to the doctor's and they said I lost 25 pounds, which shocked me, and it motivated me to keep doing what I was doing since I knew it was actually *possible* to lose weight.

And from my experiences with other fat people, I can guarantee you 99% of obese people do not look in the mirror and don't think ""Wow, I'm looking great."" They're equally likely to be self concious. But doing something about it isn't always easy. They could have depression, which makes it hard to do *anything*. They could have an eating disorder. It could be anything. It's not because they just don't care. But losing weight when you're already fat is a difficult and discouraging process.",wt_anonymous,2,4,0.7

They even argue with the people pointing out that this information is misleading or quickly redirect the subject to be about how someone else is wrong in some way. 

I'm pretty progressive. I see a lot of progressive circles doing this. It pissed me off because while we share the same goals, they're screwing it up by making us look bad and creating useless noise. 

It's counterproductive to blatantly ignore the reality of whatever bill is being discussed. One can still push back against a bill without exageration.

show?? My family has been down in the dumps recently, and something really good is happening, I'm
obviously happy about it but my friend told me that my reaction was way too nonchalant and lackluster, like
almost mad. Idk how I'm supposed to respond to this stuff? Shouldn't it be obvious that I'm excited, why do I
have to pretend to be so excited about it? I'm already mentally and emotionally exhausted from keeping up my faces all day, I shouldn't have to do it in the comfort of my own home as well, right? Like I literally fake my
accent for my friends so they can understand me. (I'm white, just come from a hilly-billy town and it shows in
my accent) why do I need to fake my emotions to the extent that it feels literally comical to do it? And this
get called lackluster?? It makes me want to pull my hair out. Not to mention sometimes I see people doing
things that seem so stupid/unreasonable, to me at
least, (crying for a dead relative they never met, and another time, forcing someone, me, to give up the
memorial card they were making for their dog to someone else, because the death of a fellow person is
more important.) and getting so much attention and no one ever seems to question their response to it? The
death of a relative you never met is about the same as seeing someone in your town passed away to me at
least. Idk tho, i could just be weird like my friends say but I'm not too sure. My father is the exact same way, so I guess it's something I get from him.

I‚Äôve been here nearly three years now and I have made several new friends during bingo and other activities- last summer, my friend Daniel got sick out of nowhere and was hospitalized, instead of coming back to the facility, his wife decided to take him somewhere closer to home and then he passed.  It was upsetting, especially since the last time I saw him before he was hospitalized, he wasn‚Äôt quite himself.  Then my neighbor with dementia fell out of bed and suffered a broken hip for nearly a month without it being caught- we weren‚Äôt really friends but I helped her with things when I could- like holding her cup so she could get a drink or picking her pillow up from the floor and placing it back under her head she‚Äôd say‚Äùthank ya, darling‚Äù so sweetly and she always seemed so scared so I‚Äôd sing to her from across the hall or play music or an audio book for her to calm her- because she was in pain for so long her health deteriorated quickly towards the end, I sat talking with her family members while they kept vigil and then she passed.  Recently another across the hall neighbo, who was also a stroke survivo, was hospitalized after having what they called a ‚Äúmini stroke‚Äú.  Every day she would be up and down the hal- she was a familiar presence but once she came back from the hospital she was not able to get up in her chai, she just stayed in bed until she passed two weeks ago.

245,"Why I think battery EVs or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are not the future, but hydrogen internal combustion engines (disclaimer: this is one long but hopefully interesting post).",11rd6ta,"Internal combustion engines (ICE) are not new and we have long been using them in our vehicles such as cars for years if not decades and this is a technology that we mankind, have huge expertise and experience in but when the topic of ""what is the long-term solution for transportation"" arrives, it's mainly the argument between BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) vs HFCVs (Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles) but many people are either not aware of hydrogen being able to run on our current ICE that powers billions of our cars around the globe from developing to developed countries or, they are aware of it but are put off by the inefficiency or simply due to the fact that there is basically no hydrogen ICE vehicle on market today (unlike Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, as there are a few like Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo that are sold in selective markets with slow but growing hydrogen infrastructure).

First, let's tackle hydrogen vs BEVs, I will keep this simple because *some* of this has already been discussed on this subreddit itself. Hydrogen helps us not be dependent on limited resources like lithium, which also required mining, and mining ALSO has huge ecological side effects, this is an issue despite BEVs being the number 1 tech to have the highest efficiency. Something not so often discussed? I come from India, and I will tell you that developing countries like mine, have a hard time accessing stable consistent power supplies for homes themselves. As far as I know, in both Europe and countries like the US, the term ""power cut"" is not something that is often worried about unless due to a natural disaster, in my country, powers cuts are way more common without natural disasters and to put it nicely, BEVs simply does not make sense for every part of the world.

Now let's move to Hydrogen fuel cell vs combustion tech. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, for those who are knowledgeable in this topic, would know that it is often called ""simply better"" than hydrogen's use on ICE because after BEVs, hydrogen fuel cell tech is pretty efficient compared to hydrogen ICE which is unfortunately and probably the most inefficient tech we are talking about in this post. Then why hydrogen on ICE?

* Lack of dependence on rare or limited resources: For example, mass-produced fuel cells that are used today use metals such as platinum, ruthenium and etc. While researchers have experimented with trying to replace rare metals like platinum with different and perhaps more common resources, it's still very much in experimental stages and I am only saying that for only a few components like platinum, other components like ruthenium don't have complete replacements in research-level yet. It should also be understood that research being done in a university for example as an experiment replacing a rare material like platinum won't end up being mass-produced in real-world applications anytime soon, also considering how HFCVs receive less than half of the billions of investments BEVs are getting these days. But when it comes to hydrogen on ICE, the internal combustion engine on your gas car doesn't really use any ""rare"" resources or metals, the same goes for hydrogen ICE!
* Scaling production: This is huge, automakers need to revamp production facilities and etc to make these battery or hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles, which makes it a much bigger, longer, and more difficult transition/move long-term globally, maybe even unrealistic, but hydrogen on ICE is technically and relatively much easier. I mean despite the electric hype, billions of cars on road still use petrol-powered ICE and EVs still account for a very small percentage minority of the whole automotive sales pie. And hydrogen on ICE is not as different as gasoline on ICE, the tank changes, the fuel source changes from petrol, and with some small modifications to the ICE, we can literally keep many existing factories from automakers that have been pumping these ICE-powered vehicles for decades, the only obstacle in my eyes is the infrastructure which is growing, but it is pretty slow and you are limited to countries like UK or states like California.
* Retrofitting/conversions: I mean, this is a no-brainer, if we really do explore and possibly (or hopefully!) adapt hydrogen combustion/ICE as the long-term solution, it would be way, WAY easier to retrofit/convert an existing gas car with an ICE to a Hydrogen car with an ICE, much easier than the conversions you see online that make gas cars electric but such BEV conversions are way more expensive and unrealistic for the public. Same goes for hydrogen fuel cells, so is it really a good idea to adapt these technologies instead when we already have so many ICE vehicles on-road? What, will we scrap them for climate change?
* Cars staying as real cars (applies for motorbikes too): This is especially for car enthusiasts like myself. Hydrogen on ICE is a dream come true for us, I mean you might have already heard this somewhere else but the sound, the vibrations of these sports cars will survive thanks to hydrogen. Heck, MANUAL STICK SHIFTS WILL SURIVIVE, not one of those fake manual simulators on battery-powered EVs.

Now about how inefficient hydrogen on ICE is, I would like to mention that the use of hydrogen on ICE as a whole tech is still very immature and lacks the years and money of development on fuel cells or most importantly, battery electric vehicles received. The early electric cars sucked too, they barely had any range, charging was a bigger pain, and a lot fewer options to choose from but look at where they are now. I think the same optimism needs to exist if we are to make use of other alternative technologies such as Hydrogen on ICE. Toyota (a great example here) has silently been developing and investing as one of the few automakers on hydrogen (both fuel cells and hydrogen ICE) and probably the only one for hydrogen ICE with its Toyota corolla prototype that it has raced on several occasions and try to make use of motorsport as the testbed.

[Toyota was also able to make several improvements to its hydrogen ICE-powered](https://pressroom.toyota.com/the-familiarity-of-sound-sensation-without-all-of-the-carbon-toyota-refines-its-hydrogen-engine-corolla-concept/)[ Toyota Corolla race car, here are their statements;](https://pressroom.toyota.com/the-familiarity-of-sound-sensation-without-all-of-the-carbon-toyota-refines-its-hydrogen-engine-corolla-concept/)

>Some of the improvements of the special turbocharged hydrogen engine include enhancing power output to a level equivalent to that of a gasoline engine through engine calibration; changing the refueling location to include both sides of the vehicle to allow for quicker fill times during races; and shaving off an additional 88 pounds from the overall vehicle weight.

&#x200B;

>One key point was that we reduced the refueling time from an initial five minutes at the Fuji 24-hour in April by 40 percent to about three minutes in Autopolis, and then again to about two minutes (at Suzuka), or a 60 percent improvement, in just three races

This shows how development can improve technologies that were once probably not as good and I often see in the general internet from hardcore EV and tech fans trashing hydrogen (Elon calling them ""fool cells"" certainly didn't help) but while electric cars are better than gas vehices in many aspects today, they were not before/back then, so this really should not be a reason to put a full stop on hydrogen because development and improvements takes time and efforts from us. It does not make sense to throw the towel and stick with ""the future is electric"" just because another tesla fanboy said so (no offense), what we do today will impact the future, we make the future.

**My personal message to automakers** around the globe if they ever see this post (probably .0001% chance):

**Stop investing in the BEV hype, stop investing in hydrogen fuel cells, start investing in hydrogen infrastructure, you people already have the internal combustion engine on your gas vehicles that you have been selling for decades, it's extremely easy to switch them to hydrogen from petrol, you know it, rather than switching to fuel cells or batteries as a whole, just use your damn money to improve the hydrogen infrastructure, if all automakers do this, we can tackle climate change (which is why we are even considering alternative technologies) possibly even sooner. People won't lose their jobs in the automotive inudstry. Heck, as a hardcore car enthusiast, sensational cars may continue to live well thanks to hydrogen too.**

Stop trying the same things over and over again in bed if they don't work. If I'm laying there looking bored or it's taking forever to get aroused it's probably not working. And for the love of God stop trying it over and over again, if it didn't work the first 5 times you did it then doing it the exact same way again isn't going to magically work this time. This has happened with several of my past partners including my most recent long term relationship. They always comment it's hard to make me finish. It isn't, I have even given them exactly what will make me finish, they do it once and it works. Then we for some reason go back to the stuff that doesn't and they rarely ever do the stuff that does again. It's like they take it as a personal challenge that it doesn't work and they want to make it happen. Focus on the stuff that does work, not to say you can't try the non working stuff in a new way or just try new stuff.

I had a phase when I was insecure about my intelligence, and there was this time when I made a bumbling fool out of myself for (when attempting to put a plastic sealing clip on coffee bag.) It's very simple but the design of the item threw me off, and I ended up overthinking it. 

My parents were trying to comfort me about this, one evening, and they were successful (we had a good laugh) until I went deeper into details and how it lasted for 5 mins (I was still feeling down) and then dad mumbled in laugh  ""oh, please don't tell me that"". 

I confronted them about this once, and they told me this was supposed to be a joke. However, when I think about this again..I don't get what is supposed to be funny in that sentence? Where's the catch?

Searching for content, I need to navigate through paid ad links, that I don‚Äôt have an interest in. Next, I need to review the link choices to me as publishers have laced their content with keywords and lengthy (often garbage) content that is of no help to me.  

Finally, and worst of all, searching for news with Google is a joke. Google does nothing to separate publications that have pay walls from those offering free content. Why? They know people want information on what they‚Äôre searching for and don‚Äôt want to click a link to get a damn subscription blocker in front of them.

261,My mom triggered my eating disorder,11r6c1q,"I‚Äôve been struggling with active anorexia for well over 3 years. It started at the beginning of the pandemic when I was forced to work from home due to being immunocompromised and took a stark nose dive at the beginning of 2022. I won‚Äôt go into details, but the ensuing disordered patterns lead to a small intestinal obstruction that I‚Äôve had to juggle alongside this disorder.

Because of this obstruction, I‚Äôve had to be on Prednisone which has thrown my entire appetite into whack and has been an absolute nightmare to deal with. I eat compulsively then feel immense guilt or panic about it which throws me back into the restrict/binge cycle that I stopped at the end of 2021 to step into full restriction. I‚Äôm insanely uncomfortable with this medication, but I can‚Äôt stop it or I‚Äôll end up in the hospital again and again and again. It‚Äôs been wreaking havoc on my mental state to say the least.

My mother told me I was gaining weight today and while she framed it as a positive, I have explained time and time again that comments or ‚Äúcompliments‚Äù on my body, weight, food intake, appearance, etc. are triggering and unnecessary. I don‚Äôt need to hear any of it. I got upset and she quickly swapped to ‚Äúyou look healthy‚Äù which really wasn‚Äôt any more helpful since I‚Äôm *not* actually healthy.

263,Outlook for Android sucks,11r5jkg,"When you change your password (as is required by my company) then everything gets changed, especially exchange. Which is fine, that's all Working as intended. But then, with the process of changing my password, I need to change outlook for Androids password. It won't let me.

There is no setting or options in the app to set a new password. There is no options to even troubleshoot issues with your account. The only indication I get that I'm no longer getting emails is that my account gets locked out and I have to contact one of my coworkers to unlock my account (I'm a desktop support)

This is frustrating, as, per their own documentation, I should have gotten a notification after the first time it failed to connect. That should have let me change my password (heaven's forbid I miss the notification though I guess) but that has not worked once since I have started working there.

I have had to, every month, delete my account from the app, clear the cache, and readd my account otherwise it will not work.

The only real solution would be for Microsoft to get their heads out of their butts and let me change the password manually. But I don't think that will happen. 

Anyway, if you have issues with this then the official instructions are as follows 1) change the password 2) wait for the notification, then change your password 3) if you do not see this notification (after you unlock your account), reset the whole app and start again

I‚Äôve been having issues with my friend Hans (28M) who I thought of as a close friend. Things have just been an absolute mess between us for the past couple of weeks. The main issues that I have with Hans are that he‚Äôs emotionally abusive, dismissive of my feelings, and  has constantly tried to paint me out to be a villain in almost every situation lately. I feel like he‚Äôs consistently been projecting his own issues and insecurities onto me. I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôm perfect in any way. I acknowledge my flaws and know there are things about myself I can improve on, but I‚Äôve always tried to do my best when it comes to considering him because I do care about him. On the other hand he‚Äôs been treating me like he doesn‚Äôt give a damn about me. If my opinion isn‚Äôt what he wants to hear he dismisses it. If I voice my emotions he says that I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo emotional‚Äù, ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù, multiple variations of the word angry etc. Not to mention he says that I act ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù to him when I‚Äôve never once thought that I was better than anyone on this Earth and it‚Äôs not in my character to treat people that way. (If I‚Äôm being honest it lowkey feels like he‚Äôs jealous or intimidated by me in some way)

I remember a few weeks ago I just told Hans that I just wanted him to treat me as though we‚Äôre equals  and that I don‚Äôt treat my friends as if they‚Äôre lower than me because I view them as being on the exact same level I am. His response was ‚Äúfriends don‚Äôt think of each other as equal. That‚Äôs the biggest lie I‚Äôve ever heard. I could only treat you as equal say if we both worked the same position at a job, but we don‚Äôt so I can‚Äôt do that‚Äù (I know looking back on it it sounds embarrassing and toxic on his end that I was pretty much asking him to give me the bare minimum and looking back on it should‚Äôve never had to do that)

Last Thursday is when things got really bad. Once again Hans started an argument with me and I got tired of being verbally abused so I explained to him that I was sick of his shit and that if he wasn‚Äôt going to treat me like he appreciated me that I didn‚Äôt have to deal with it and I wouldn‚Äôt be his friend anymore. 

I didn‚Äôt hear from him at this point but he still had me on social media so I assumed he would calm down and that we would just talk another day. Yesterday I posted a meme that had nothing to do with him on my Instagram story and I guess he saw it and proceeded to block me on every social media I have (and I mean EVERYTHING including an old Instagram connected to my current account that I don‚Äôt even use anymore). Instead of just sliding up on my story and asking ‚ÄúIs this about me?‚Äù he jumped to conclusions and just decided to basically erase me out of his life over it

I wouldn‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm angry about how things went down because his behaviors were incredibly toxic, I didn‚Äôt want to deal with them anymore and this was probably a sign that he doesn‚Äôt need to be in my life but I am hurt. It‚Äôs just insane to me that an almost thirty year old man lacks accountability and is so immature that he‚Äôs not willing to accept his own faults and would gladly abandon a friendship over being wrong.

Part of me wants to reach out to try to make things right if he unblocks me but the other just wants to say ‚Äúfuck it, it is what it is and he never deserved a friend like me in the first place‚Äù and act like he doesn‚Äôt exist

287,my job sucks,11qsg05,"this is just a rant cause i‚Äôm so stressed and need to get it off my chest. the company i work for does not care about their employees in the slightest, they only care about money. 
i get this is expected from most companies but it‚Äôs still so frustrating and difficult 
i‚Äôm a university student, limiting me to casual work only, i can‚Äôt get myself on a contract. 
i started off strong being given minimum 26 hours a week, up to 34, and i was thriving. 
however as time has gone on, the owners of the company have decided they want to spend less money on employees, and i mean way less. they‚Äôre cutting back rosters to no end, leaving not just me, but everyone else, with barely any hours weekly. and on top of that, they‚Äôre currently conducting job interviews to hire MORE staffs (specifically 15 and 16 years olds who are so much cheaper to pay) and leaving people like me to pick up the scraps 

i‚Äôve been working here for a year and i am arguably the hardest worker they have. i haven‚Äôt slacked off, ever. i put in 110% every shift and go above and beyond for this company that doesn‚Äôt care or take notice. they would rather roster on teenagers who slack off all day, and generate too many customer complaints, simply because it‚Äôll save them a few dollars. 

i‚Äôm an adult, i have things to pay for, i have bills and groceries and petrol, and 8 hours a week is not enough to cover anything. 

plus they keep making empty promises to me. ‚Äúwe‚Äôll train you in a different department to pick up more hours‚Äù, great, where are they? why am i still getting 8 hours?

i want to look for a new job, but when one of my fellow supervisors handed in her resignation recently, she was quite literally told, ‚Äúno you can‚Äôt resign, we still need you‚Äù. how can i keep this job, as well as a new job, without having overlaps in shifts given to me? i‚Äôm just frustrated by this 

i wish companies cared more about work ethic over how cheap an employee is to pay.",maquaa,2,2,1.0

293,"""Why do you run away when I enter the room?""",11qphnw,"My father asked this. For several years now I have been purposefully avoiding him. I isolate myself in my bedroom to avoid him. If I hear him in the living room or kitchen I will skip meals and just sleep for the whole day to just avoid having to interact with him. I hate my father. He was never a parent to me, he never raised me, and he has anger issues and is a racist, bigot, misogynistic - he's literally everything I hate. And I'm also everything that he hates. I'm progressive with all my views, I'm a lesbian and questioning my gender, and I wore my mask the entire pandemic and still do when in heavily populated areas. But he doesn't know all this, because I hide it from him, because I know he would either kick me out of the house or hurt me if he knew. He may have never laid a hand on me, but he has beaten my brother, so I know he's capable of hurting me, too. 

Recently he was just really rude to me. I planned on eating the leftover pizza, he saw my plate, and then proceeded to call me greedy four separate times, raised his voice, and got angry despite me offering some of the pizza to him. Then he left and slammed the door. It wasn't even an argument, it was just him getting angry in less than a minute, then leaving. It escalated faster than I knew how to stop it, and it made me scared when I had my father towering over me, getting in my face and acting angry. I cried for over an hour afterward. 

I don't know why this specific situation made me snap, but it did. I am just so tired of my father. I'm tired of him taking out his unresolved trauma and anger on me the moment I do something he doesn't like, and I'm tired of putting in all the work in my own therapy to be a better person, but he's allowed to be an asshole and continue hurting me. Why am I responsible for dealing with daddy issues when he's the one that did this to me? 

I blocked his number and blocked him on Facebook, even though I never texted or interacted with him anyway. But it still felt good to do, because I don't want him to have any access to me at any point in time. Then I started making my avoidance of him obvious. In the past, I avoided him if possible, but if I failed I would just stay quiet and try not to engage if I saw him. Nope, not this time. As soon as he walks into the room, I get up from the couch and blatantly leave the room. This made him angry, of course. He acts like he is entitled to me as his daughter, and he only cares to say something when I'm openly defiant. ""Why do you leave every time I enter a room?"" and ""you don't have to do that. Are you always going to be this way?"" They're all spoken with frustration and anger, but I'm not going to talk to him and try to sort this out. I've done my years of therapy and medication and self reflection, I'm not doing the work to fix our relationship when I don't even want to and he won't even try. 

And what am I supposed to tell him? I know he's not stupid. Surely, he knows that I hate him. I've not made it subtle. I stopped calling him dad and only refer to him as father years ago. I never talk with him, and when I do, it's short and curt. I saw him maybe once a week before I started to actively avoid him, and now I engage with him even less. I openly argue with and push back against any bigoted or racist remarks he makes. Every time we engage, it's neutral or negative. I'm never pleased or happy when around him. He must know why. And yet, he still asks. 

I don't know what kind of answer he wants. 

I'm not going to openly tell him I hate him. I'm not stupid, either. I'm not putting myself in potential danger. I do all this because I don't have to directly face my father. I'm not spitting in his face, so he can't directly challenge me, and he can't accuse me of anything. I know I stand no chance against him physically, and I'm under no delusions that my mother would have enough of a backbone to support me in a verbal fight against him. 

So, I'm stuck in a limbo. I'm going to keep avoiding him. I'm going to keep hating him. I'm never going to be brave enough to say it to his face. And I guess I'm going to keep doing all this until it blows up in my face. My only solace is he probably doesn't care enough to try to confront or have a serious talk with me, so maybe I'll be left alone for the rest of my life. One can only hope.",random-shit-writing,4,3,0.81
294,Can't hear back from my stupid principal because god knows why. I'm pissed.,11qpg6u,"I'm a high school teacher. I'm not going to explain the ""reasons"" for personal and privacy reasons, but just know that it needs to be addressed and soon and this is just my rant. I'm not really looking for advice, just a place to rant.

My principal needs to observe one of my classes and have a conference for reasons and I named 5 or 6 dates and times that would work for me and asked her to get back to me if none of them were convenient for her. It took a week to hear back from her. During this week, I offered to go to meet her in her office to discuss times and dates and to further discuss the reason for meeting, but she's always busy and according to the VP, rarely in her office. She's also a site coordinator in the education program at the local college (she works once a week with soon-to-be teachers) so I know she's busy and I'm trying to respect that.

But when I heard from her a week after my time/date email, she asked for my phone number, which I included in my original email. I gave it to her again and 8 days later, she emailed me that she forgot to call. I visited her office, was told she wasn't in, and left a note. Another week passes. She emails to apologize and asks for my number again and says she'll call 2 days ago (yes, Saturday, I know its stupid) at a time that would not work because of my job. I told her ok, asked my boss for a short break to answer the call and was all set. She never called! I had an email when I got home saying she had to move the phone call to a different time but I didn't get that email (or call that she was supposed to make) because she sent it while I was at work (where there is a no-phone policy). 

The semester is almost halfway done and the reason she needs to observe and conference is going to be long done and over with if I don't get her into my classroom soon. I left her 2 notes today (one with the secretary, one in her mailbox). I guess I just wanted to rant because if it was me not replying to her, I'd have lost my job.

Why do I get the feeling that most girls would not complain nearly as much if they never had sex again?

Still nobody can drive. You all drive like beginners or reckless. You dont know spatial awareness or foresighted driving.

Yet everything is suited just for cars. Big roads (in bad shape), big parking spaces. You city is one big piece of grey beton!
I cant even walk from one shopping area to another without walking with cars on the road. The entrances of shopping blocks are streets. There is no walkway to the supermarket. 
Your cars are way to big!

Its fucking loud! Every place is allowed to play loud music. You get scream at by people advertising their god - amplified to concert level.  Your cars and bikes are allowed way to loud.

I saw a post on a sub a few weeks ago about a plane crash where a pilot let his children in the cockpit and let them play around and pretend to fly the plane. Long story short, one kid pulled too hard on the yolk and disengaged autopilot. Neither pilot realized and failed to get the plane back under control.The plane crashed. There were so many people in the comments saying the kids were stupid and should have been aborted/never born and that they were dumbasses. They were KIDS! It‚Äôs the fault of the dumbass pilots who they put their trust in who were supposed to be smart enough not to let a kid play around in a cockpit. But bc of reddits weird fucking hate boner for kids, everyone was blaming two children for their own deaths!

I was on Instagram and there was a video of a woman at a trampoline place and she was doing some flips and a small toddler accidentally walked in front of her and got hit.

307,I am done with gaming. Am i the only one who feels like this?,11qgqe9,"I have multiple reasons. 

1. Money. It‚Äôs all about money nowadays. How can they possibly get us to pay them the most for the littlest  bits of nontent. Look at EA. With their ridiculously expensive sims packs. Releasing the same content as dlc for each of their games. Sims 2 pets as dlc, surely sims 3 and 4 will have them in the base games? Nope. Dlc in those as well. Or how about locking the ending to your story in a 40 dollar dlc? Looking at you ubisoft. Not to mention micro transactions for online modes, that also take up all of the company‚Äôs attention, leaving the single player to rot without any new content. Looking at you rockstar, with your precious gta online. 

2. Deep life experiences. Games nowadays need to have deep, meaningful stories. Games even refer to themselves as ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù instead of games. I liked this when it was new, but i am missing games that were just that. Games. A simple shooter, a simple beat em up, a game where you play as a cheerleader and you kill zombies with a chainsaw. Great fun. Now it must all be serious, deep and meaningful, like the last of us, red dead 2, and countless of others. 

3. Realism. Realism will be the death of video games. Especially when the developers favor realism over fun. Like in red dead 2. Where witnesses spawn out of nowhere, in the middle of nowhere, run for 20 steps and magically get the law on you. Soo realistic! Not. I am all for realistic graphics, animations and the like. But not if it sacrifices fun. 

4. Broken promises and delays. How often do we see an e3 demo, and the game looks absolutely gorgeous, just for the finalized product to be a downgraded, empty shell of what was promised to us. It‚Äôs a scam. Nothing more. Who could forget the lies the developers of no man‚Äôs sky spread, only for their finalized product to be an empty, soulless product. Sure it‚Äôs better now, but it‚Äôs too little too late for me. And not to mention delays. Especially when the current gen versions are already on the shelves, but the last gen people are forced to wait for month after month, delay after delay. And for what? A product that is undeniably going to be inferior to the current gen counterparts. Like cyberpunk, it will have longer loading times, fewer npc‚Äôs, worse graphics, worse fps drops. And yet these companies expect their consumers to pay full price for an inferior version of their game after being forced to wait way longer than others. I find these practices absolutely unprofessional and unacceptable. 

Gaming has gone from a fun pastime, to an overpriced luxurious accommodation. 
Where only the rich are able to pay for the full package and get the full ‚Äúexperience.‚Äù The base game for the sims 4 might me free, but that‚Äôs only because it is devoid of content. If you want the full experience, that will only cost you a little over 1000 dollars. For a video game. I am disgusted at what this industry has become. A capitalistic industry, designed to get as much money from you as humanly possible, while at the same time delivering as little content as possible, with as little effort put in as possible. Developers will screw you over where ever and whenever they can, because the player does not matter, only the player‚Äôs money does. 

And I for one am absolutely done with it. I haven‚Äôt bought a new game in a long time, there was one new game I wanted, but I have decided to forget about that one too. At 26 I have achieved precious little in my life. All the while I was wasting away with one game or another. No longer. I am done. It‚Äôs sad it has to end like this. But I am absolutely done with this disgusting, money hungry industry.",CIassicNegan,5,3,0.71

I have been through so much pain and I just want to know what it‚Äôs like to be happy, I want to find a girl that could help me forget about the girl that hurt me a girl that will treat me the same way I treat her.

321,We progressives are not recognizing how our strategies to combat systemic discrimination and harm is actually driving conservatives further into their ideological extremism,11q4krr,"While we need *progressives* (as opposed to ‚Äúradicals‚Äù), culture is a yin-yang of our conservatives and progressives. The loss of either would put society in peril. The moral foundations of progressives and conservatives is a mechanism written into our psychology. We are literally born with a blueprint of our moral ideology that we revise over the course of our lives. 

The problem is in our tribalism and not recognizing the symbiotic relationship in a society of people where half advocates for growth and the other half advocates for temperance. 

When one group vilifies the other, we egg the backfire effect and polarize our society. 

We all know the mistakes that conservatives are making in society at the moment. Facebook is an echo chamber of conservative failing layer to bear. 

The thing that scares me is that progressives are suppose to be leaders of change. Cultivators. Shepherds of change. We  aren‚Äôt recognizing that our own actions are egging the right and pushing them harder right. The quickest way to get someone to stop listening to you is to yell at them. 

The righteous echo chamber of social media and the availability cascade of negative media has assured that we are justified in our moral retribution. We are caught up in our anger and frustration that we feel justified dolling our social shaming as a means, we hope to get people to conform away from systemic failings and narrow-minded views. Our knee jerk response is to punish those who perpetuate systemic harm that they were born into, as if the ship can be turned faster if we just push harder.

We need more compassion, and patience give people the space they need to grow. 

I am not saying that we need tolerate discrimination nor hate but we need to give people the space and patience to recognize their mistakes without fear that they will be never forgiven or to be defined by them for the rest of their lives. 

Literally the *science* of how minds change for the better. The best available research tells us that patience, compassion and cultivating curiosity are all essential components to combating discrimination and harm. 

We are progressives. We are not afraid of new ideas. We need to abandon ineffective solutions for one‚Äôs that actually affect change.",majeric,8,8,0.7

""But ai makes art more accessible"" except you can do it with a very simple trick, established since the dawn of humanity is called ""Pick up a damn pencil"".

""It helps artist"" as if we always never had other, more better solutions in the past millennium.

To me the beauty of art from the earliest time to now regardless of digital, painting, sculptur, or even camera pictures, is that is something you have to make from the ground up even with the most respected artist, the fact that is made by them with their own hands is what makes art.

334,Lazy ex getting everything I want,11pypgx,"Obligatory warning that there‚Äôs a lot of pieces to this so it might be very jumbled.

My ex (now m18) and I (now f18) started dating at the end of 7th grade, and broke up halfway through sophomore year (two days before my birthday üòí). So about 2 1/2 years. Throughout the relationship, he never wanted to spend time with me. He was always too nervous to hang out with me around my family, but hardly ever wanted me to come to his house either. He never wanted to call, and would pretty much ignore me when we did to play video games with his brother. He stood me up on the Fourth of July, and granted I was grounded so he couldn‚Äôt contact me to change plans, but my parents were sympathetic and let me use my phone that night, and he hadn‚Äôt texted at all. I asked what the hell happened and he basically said he got too nervous. He pulled that sort of thing at least two more times over the course of the relationship. We argued a lot over that, and he‚Äôd always make promises to change and never would. Once, I sent him a long paragraph about how he never puts effort into anything, and he felt bad and promised me that he would learn to put more effort into stuff, and never did. I put up with so much. So essentially, the relationship was sucky.

During our relationship though, I found music, and decided that I want to pursue it as a career. It‚Äôs my biggest passion in life and tbh I think I‚Äôm pretty good at it. But soon after I found it, he found it too, and decided the same thing. So part of my anger in this whole situation is that it was mine first.

The main part of this though is that he doesn‚Äôt work on anything BUT music. He has a horrible GPA (last I knew at least, but I‚Äôm sure it hasn‚Äôt changed), no job, can‚Äôt get his license because he has panic attacks when he gets behind the wheel (I know I shouldn‚Äôt be judgmental of this part because he did have a bad car accident when he was younger. I guess I just associate it with all the excuses about being too anxious to hang out with me that he never pushed against at all. So just take this for what you will), and he‚Äôs honestly very emotionally immature (as evidenced by my junior year when he apologized for everything, which I was grateful for and genuinely wanted to be friends, but he couldn‚Äôt accept that and kept trying to get me to break up with my now bf to get back with him).

So there‚Äôs all that. Jump to this year, senior year. The talent show was 4 days ago, and he and his band won. I ended up not even competing because of all the homework I have, but I‚Äôm somewhat glad now because I know I would‚Äôve lost to them and that would be a hard punch to the ego. But this has just been driving me insane. Every year that they‚Äôve announced that the talent show is coming up, I start getting crazy anxious. I‚Äôm in constant competition with him and he doesn‚Äôt even know it. I‚Äôm terrified that he‚Äôs better than me at music. If he is, it‚Äôs only because he REFUSES to do anything that he doesn‚Äôt want to do, while I‚Äôm juggling high school (trying to graduate salutatorian), a college class, an EMT class, and my job as a manager for the local movie theater. I don‚Äôt have the time to practice, and now he‚Äôs being rewarded for doing like %5 of what I do with everything I want. It‚Äôs driving me insane.

Idk what I expect to hear, anything is welcome. Thanks for reading :)

TL/DR: My shitty ex refuses to do anything except work on music, while I‚Äôm juggling responsibilities and have no time to practice. As a result, he won the talent show and I didn‚Äôt even end up competing because of lack of time, and I feel as though he‚Äôs getting everything I‚Äôve ever wanted as reward for being lazy.",Ok_Writing_6042,0,1,1.0

Is it somehow now a bad thing for me to be walking with my chest out?

I was told I have broad shoulders but I also have a bad habit of letting my arms hang too far from my body sometimes ""Like people who pretend to have bigger lats than they do""

But today I was walking and some douche with his girl was behind me and started laughing and making jokes mocking me behind my back, saying ""Oh look at that, he thinks he's a tough guy, with his chest out and walking tall.""

It actually offended me and I turned around and looked right at them, they shut up pretty quickly and didn't say anything, but honestly I just found that a bit offensive so I had to look back at them in an aggressive way.

But please don't confuse this with me being an aggressive person all the time, I'm a nice person but when people are disrespectful to me for no reason at all, simply for just walking how I normally walk, it is annoying.

What annoyed me most is he was implying I was weak and not tough at all, but I've spent most of my late teens and 20's training MMA to stop being a victim to bullying and to defend myself in the rough area I grew up in and I go to the gym constantly, so I know for a fact I'm not weak or a wanna-be tough guy, I worked too hard to get to where I am.

So my question is how am I supposed to be walking??? I am wondering how if my body language comes off as aggressive or like a ""wannabe tough guy"". If my body language does come off as aggressive I would definitely want to work on that and fix it since it isn't my intention, I'd prefer to walk around this world having people be friendly to me and in turn I can more easily be open and friendly to them...",Symbolicalism,4,4,0.83

I want to check them."" He didn't listen to a single word I told him. Now, my only lottery checker is down for the rest of the day because I can't get the error to go away. Some people don't understand that when the cashier tells you not to do something, there's a reason for it. I'm not just telling you that you can't do something because I don't feel like doing it. 

This isn't even the first time a customer has broken a lottery machine. One time, our lottery was completely down because of a storm. An old lady tried to come in and use the machine where you print out fastplays yourself. I told her, ""Please don't use that machine lottery is down. There's an out of order sign."" She sticks her money in it anyway and gets mad at me when her online tickets won't print out. There was nothing I could do either. The worst part about all this is that these are regular customers because I work at a small gas station in a small town, so I see these people daily. You think they would know better.

344,I Miss College,11pqp67,"Highschool was a nightmare for me I felt totally alone and helpless. Half the teachers hated me for being gay the other half hated me for being a stoner. I was also addicted to pills just to get through the day. I was a total virgin with no kissing or anything just because my anxiety was so bad.

I had one teacher who was my mentor and I would probably be in a ditch without her. She convinced me to go to college and in college everything turned around. I went to therapy the college offered and worked past my anxiety. I was having amazing regular sex with sexy ass college boys every weekend. I had a dope group of friends that I had fun with constantly. 

When covid happened half my friend group dropped out, the other half went back home to finish out online classes. I lost both part time jobs I was working and ended up dropping out for a semester. I only had my senior year left so I ended up going back and finishing the two semesters online. In that time I was sexually assaulted, my best friend stole/broke around a grand worth of stuff from me and trashed the room she was renting in my apartment, I had to move because the increased my rent then had to move again because the new place increased my rent again.

Now after graduating I got lucky and I have a good job and can support myself without a roommate. I can go out to eat whenever I want whenever I want. I am taking my first vacation since college this week to NYC. But I am just so so so unhappy. 

Fuck covid, fuck capitalism, fuck liars, fuck thief's. I'm only 22 and I'm so tired of the world. 

Everything was so much more simple when I was in college.

I haven't had sex in over a year because when I try all I can think about is my assault. I have no friends anymore. The past two months other than walking my dog I've left my house twice.

I know I've fallen into unhealthy habits but I just feel like I'm drowning. I just want to go back to stressing over assignments and fucking around with my friends.

345,My friend called my ex abusive bf attractive,11pqono,"So me (18) is friends with this girl we will call her K (18) since we were probably 13 and we are like sisters. 

I had this abusive ex we will call him E (17) when I was 15 and K was my rock when I was going through it and absolutely hated him. E would try to isolate me and not let me have any friends and he would verbally abuse me, he tried to strangle me and almost broke my hand. Used  - soup of slide - against me and self hooom.  He would also talk about his ex constantly like he was still in love with her. 

I‚Äôve forgiven him for doing that to me bcs I can‚Äôt live in the past forever and I have moved on.   But K is friends with E best friend we will call him C (17).

349,My Struggle,11pnp4k,"I am a 29 year old man in the US on disability benefits who lives with his parents. The following is from my personal journal:

""I learned the hard way that I cannot stalk my way into being a woman's boyfriend, fianc√©, or husband - it will never happen and I'm done with that. I'm done with trying to be someone I'm not. I'm asocial, and I have been that way for a long time, for as long as I've had discernible mental illness. That's just how I am. If I had the power to become a ""normal"" person, with real two-way friendships and intimate¬†partnerships, I would have made that choice in a heartbeat, but I can't, and no psychiatric drug can fix me (and I have tried over 10 different ones including Lithium, Lamictal, Depakote, Carbamazepine, Topimirate, Saphris, Risperidone, Invega, Haldol, Latuda, and more). The initial and true reason I went on psychiatric drugs was not for primary symptoms of mental illness like mania or depression (even though when I went to my first psychiatrist I said that was the reason). The true reason was to try and change my personality and get a girlfriend, and it never worked. Before I developed mental illness (not including childhood ADHD), when I was about 12 or 13 years old, there was this girl named Cathy who I used to eat lunch with each day in an outdoor area behind my school, just the two of us, but then I developed my initial mental illness and changed and things didn't work out with us (in high school I wanted to go with her to the prom, but when I asked her to join me on my regular walk on the beach she said that she was ""not interested, never interested"", which I still vaguely remember over 10 years later because it fucking hurt. I ultimately ended up going to the prom alone after multiple other rejections). After I graduated from that school, I wanted to use psychiatric medication to fix me to make things work out interpersonal relationship wise in the future, but it never worked. Cathy blocked me for stalking/harassment (about four years ago with another Facebook account I used to go around her block I apologized to her and reminded her of us by showing her this photo of what she wrote in my middle school yearbook which you can see at https://i.ibb.co/jMp3wdv/Cathy.png , but then she blocked that Facebook account too), and this same sort of thing repeated itself with many other women who I also felt I had fallen in love with after her. Cathy has since gotten married (from my second Facebook account I saw a profile photo of hers where a man was proposing to her), but my experience with her was one of the most emotionally painful and formative experiences of my life (I still to this day have a small teddy bear holding a heart that says ""Love"" on it which she gave me on Valentine's Day when I was maybe 13 years old) and what happened set my future objectives in life. I wanted to correct what happened, but maybe with another woman. I had dreams of marriage and I wanted one day to have children with a woman who I fell in love with (sometimes when I fall in love with a woman I imagine in the future us having a child together), but I don't see either marriage or children ever happening for me. I hate my life.""",John-The-Bomb-2,1,3,1.0

Then, he starts saying how couples could also be and should always be good friends. Guess what? Right, I am single.

359,"As an artist, I am fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence and its impact on the world of art. However, I also have some concerns and frustrations with the current state of AI in the art world.",11pf9op,"Firstly, I worry about the devaluation of human creativity and talent. With AI becoming more advanced, it's possible that some people may view it as a replacement for human artists. While AI can certainly produce impressive works of art, it lacks the depth and emotional connection that comes from human creativity. Art is a reflection of the human experience, and it's important to recognize the value of human creativity and expression.

Secondly, I am concerned about the potential for AI to perpetuate biases and reinforce existing societal inequalities. AI algorithms are only as objective as the data they are trained on, and if that data reflects societal biases, then the AI will replicate those biases in its output. This is already happening in fields such as facial recognition, where AI has been found to be less accurate for people with darker skin tones. As an artist, it's important to be aware of these biases and to work towards creating more inclusive and equitable art.

Furthermore, the rise of AI-generated art raises questions about authorship and ownership. If an AI creates a work of art, who owns the copyright? Is it the creator of the AI algorithm or the person who owns the AI? These questions will become increasingly important as AI-generated art becomes more prevalent, and it's important for artists to advocate for their rights and ensure that they are properly credited and compensated for their work.

Finally, as an artist, I am frustrated by the idea that AI can replace the human element of art. Art is more than just a technical skill, it's about emotion, passion, and connection. While AI can certainly produce impressive works, it lacks the ability to connect with audiences on a deeper level. It's important for artists to continue to push the boundaries of their craft and to embrace the unique perspectives and experiences that only humans can provide.

In conclusion, while I am excited about the potential of artificial intelligence in the art world, I believe that it's important to recognize and value the human element of art. As artists, we must continue to create works that reflect our unique perspectives and experiences, while also being aware of the potential biases and ethical concerns that come with AI-generated art. By embracing both human creativity and technological innovation, we can create a more vibrant and inclusive art world.",oooooooooooh12,2,6,1.0

To me unless someone is doing something that harms you or anyone else, dangerous, illegal etc there‚Äôs no need to be judgemental or rude in the name of opinions. Demeaning or discouraging another person is not an opinion!

379,I'm sick of dating apps.,11p1ps1,"In the modern day, young men like myself are scared to pursue romantic relationships with women thanks to overfeminism. 

But there is a solution to this: dating apps. Because women on dating apps have already given some kind of consent to be romantically approached.

The problem is, these companies don't act like it. They don't police their apps any further than keeping the obvious wrong people out.

They fully allow women to use these apps for their own validation. 

My point is, I'm tired of getting matched with on these sites and these women not responding to any of my texts.

I'm not asking for anything but a chance to start a relationship. You don't have to swipe right. But if you do, at least talk to me! I'm not asking for anything except someone who's also trying.

I say - ""It wasn't empty when I last used it""

He says ""it is now. And how about a ""yessir"" knowing you used my stuff? Period.""

Him - ""You're in my house and you can't clean a toilet bowl correctly?""

So for some background information on what compelled me to write this, I was at the mall and a group of teen girls, probably between the ages of 13 and 16 were mocking a black girl and her friend, calling them racial slurs loudly. No idea what the background story was but I felt so bad for these girls and nobody else was saying anything, so I step in and I say ‚ÄúYou know what? If I was a mother to any of you? I would be DISGUSTED to see my child behaving this way and treating people like this in public.‚Äù

- ‚Äúat your ancient age..‚Äù 

- ‚Äúim a minor so whatever‚Äù 

- ‚Äúim literally a child omg‚Äù

- ‚Äúleave us alone we‚Äôre kids‚Äù

411,There are so many ways our electrical grid could be destroyed that I‚Äôve started to think humanity‚Äôs recent industrial period has been absurd,11o7cdj,"Solar storms, global warming-related natural disasters, and in certain places extreme earthquakes all have the ability to make the electricity go down for extremely long amounts of time.

Already we‚Äôre seeing global warming create weather that‚Äôs hitting the electrical grid in increasingly damaging ways. The attitude I‚Äôve adopted in response is that when my present reality gets destroyed by one or more of these threats to the electrical system, I‚Äôll have new problems, but I‚Äôll also be freed from the problems that can‚Äôt be avoided as long as the lights are on.

I don‚Äôt realistically expect our electrical paradigm to ever lose its dominance over civilization, even if it has to go through a process where it has to rebuild/fortify itself after a catastrophe. With the way that countries like China are helping develop modern infrastructure across the poor countries, electricity and industrialism are in some ways headed for a new boom.

417,I was assaulted at school and the school doesn't care.,11o4432,"Before I start, some background on the assault. It was right before lunch and the doors for the lunch room hadn't opened yet. I had gotten into a playful banter with a guy from my class. Next thing I know he was insaulted that I called him a wimp for telling me to off-myself. That's where I was punched 3 times on my left side. Around 50-100 kids witnessed the attack, even my own boyfriend and didn't do anything. The boy looked to the crowd and laughed, then 4 more punches. I dragged myself to the office which was 2 feet away, and told them what happened. Afterwards I was questioned by police then brought to the ER. I am still suffering with vision and hearing loss due to this only being 3 weeks ago. The school said they couldn't expell him due to his IEP/504, which in this case doesn't even apply. They also said that if I were to spread mis-info around the school they would try to sue me, a 16 now 17yr (happened a week before my bday- great timing). Further more they said they can't legally do anything to protect me at school, like even changing a class or lunch. He is currently doing online school with the posibility of coming back to school at anytime. I can't even get a protection order due to it not being allowed for minors who didn't have a romantic or sexual relationship previously. Almost all my teachers are on my side but one, he is my theater teacher (didn't even sign up for that class) who is maried to the director of the school. Due to it being a charter school in its first year only 40% of all teachers need to be certified, so this man has no education on theater. He threatened me on a false basis of slander and I cannot leave his class because it's too far into the year, dispite him making me uncomfrotable. The admins have done nothing to help the situation, some of the boy's friends have been calling me a bitch, or saying the assualt is my fault.

Before I get comments about 'It's just what I like"" or 'you can't control what you like', ok cool. I don't care what you like and don't like, live your life.

This could come from me being a virgin loser or cause I personally have little to no dating preferences, but certain ones, such as race + hyper specific height and weight, don't make much sense when I think about them.

For height and weight: 

Generalized ones like 'tall' 'slim' etc., I can somewhat understand , but hyper specific ones like '""6'ft"" '140lbs"" I don't get. Are you gonna pull out a ruler and scale when you meet someone?  I have doubts you can tell a persons height just from looking at them. Also people carry weight differently, so no one of the same weight looks the same. Some people try to use the excuse of 'health', which yeah maybe but there's things like metabolism.

For race:

I have yet to hear a reason for a race preference that wasn't either racism or 'Its what I like'. You're basically saying you find one race more or less attractive in looks/personality.

Anyway, we have a resident who requested their locks be changed, no problem, we asked our sister property what day their guy can come out and get this done. We had everything scheduled for today at 10am, well the resident emails me saying ""oh, can we wait until 10:30? I'm not ready."", and normally this wouldn't be a problem, except that they didn't bother to tell me they needed to change the time until ***9:50am***, literally 10 minutes until the service was scheduled.

You remember when I said that our sister property is 45 minutes away? And that this is their maintenance man, who has his own things to do at his own property? We posted a reminder on their door yesterday at 3pm, so they had all night (3pm-8am when we open) to tell me this, but they waited until 10 fucking minutes before the guy was set to change the locks to be like ""Hehe, oopsie"". 

Well, we thought we were good to go on the lock change, so he was already on his way and got here at 9:59am, so I had to ask if he could wait about 30min to change the locks per the resident's request, he could not, so he left. If we had gotten a heads up at any point between 3pm yesterday to 8am today, we could have worked around their schedule and gotten it done, but because of their shitty time management they have to wait.

We had to call a locksmith to see what their availability looks like to come out and re-key the locks and they can't be out here until Monday, no big deal to me but if the resident has an issue with that then it's their own damn fault! You can't set something for a specific time and then just change it last minute, if this were a company we were using they would have said ""no, we either do this now or you need to reschedule."", so why is it any different for a maintenance man?

We told the resident, ""because you changed the service time at the last minute, the maintenance tech we were borrowing was unable to get this done, we have a locksmith scheduled for Monday between 1-2pm, we will not be changing the time as this is a company we are using, if you are not home we will be going in and performing the service anyway."", so if they again ask if we can wait, it'll be a big fat ***NO******!!!***

I just can't take it anymore. My human, Sarah, is driving me absolutely crazy. She just won't eat the small dead animals that I so kindly provide for her. I mean, seriously, what is wrong with her? Doesn't she know that these little creatures are packed with all sorts of nutrients that she needs to survive?

I spend hours stalking and hunting these tiny creatures, carefully selecting only the best ones to bring back to Sarah as a gift. And what does she do? She recoils in disgust and throws them in the trash. Can you believe it?

I've tried everything to get her to eat them. I've left them on her pillow, on her desk, and even in her shoes (which I thought was a particularly nice touch). But no matter what I do, she just won't budge.

It's not just frustrating, it's worrying too. I mean, what if Sarah eventually malnourishes and dies because she's not getting the nutrients she needs? I couldn't bear the thought of losing her, even if she does have a habit of ignoring my meows for attention.

444,"I hate my own personality so much, and have tried valiantly to change it over the years, but to no avail...",11novu4,"As long as I can remember, I've had the worst personality. It's always been extremely difficult for me to make friends, since I was shy and always have panic attacks around people, even with children my own age when I was just a child. As a kid, I figured that it was OK, though, since schoolwork came easily and naturally to me. I figured that it would compensate for my near lack of social skills, but as an adult, that couldn't be farther from the truth.

While the other kids in the class were making friends and struggling with schoolwork, I had the exact opposite problem. During the summer break between every school year, I would vow to be a more outgoing and friendlier person. The early part of the school year was usually a success, but it honestly just felt like I was playing a character, and by the second or third month, I was extremely worn down, and my shitty anxious personality would storm back with a vengeance. Not only was/am I anxious, I would often scream and throw tantrums whenever I was overwhelmed, whether from too much noise, or people relentlessly bullying me. I was the victim, yet I was always the one sent to the principal's office whenever this happened.

At 11 or 12, I figured that I would be going through puberty soon, and that I would become more mature with lessening outbursts and anxiety. However, it seemed like it has only gotten worse. I was able to pass all my high school classes with flying colors, being the top 10 in my class of 300, but my crippling anxiety prevented me from participating in all the relevant teenager activities, such as joining clubs, dating, internships, etc. My college years saw my grades tumbling down like rocks; I used to be able to figure things out on my own without having to ask anybody for help, but now it became paramount to do so. Once again, though, I was too nervous and afraid to make friends or even ask a professor for help; I figured that I would just be bothering or annoying them, and didn't want to be seen at all.

Now I'm nearing 30, and with full brain development happening to most people at 25, I think it's way too late for me to change. Whenever I try, I just feel like I'm wearing a fake skin suit, with all the anxieties of the day wearing me down, until my regular shitty self is front and center again.

I don't make as much money as I should be, because of my lack of desire of a leadership position. Having people under me means more money, but it also means more pressure and anxiety. Plus, I feel bad for anybody who would have to work for a loser like me.

To keep the ""Telenovela"" short: Around 1/2 years ago, I joined a college film-club. Our ""manager"" (not official -she just voluntairly manages the money etc.) introduced a new pot. topic for our next film: 70s. Obviously, with highlight of 70s movies and encouraging us to share ideas over the holidays. I ended up researching and creating a small presentation about my idea. After the manager seemingly gave me the ""ok"", I introduced it to the others who liked it too. 

Welp. Turns out that was the wrong move. Our film-club was not as ""democratic"" and Manager deerest saw herself as its Kindergartener. Me presenting my idea was not only ""theft"" to her, it was an insult to her hierarchie. Something which...she told me not until it was too late. Just assumed I ""got it"". After several ""polite arguments"" later, she distanced herself from the project. Aka ""fine. Do what you want, I just don't help."" Something which I found horribly petty, but -okay. I had a plan that everyone would like. A script that was simple enough, but unique still. Something which both honoured the 70s movies in satire, but also the actual reality that 70s people in my country lived through. A fun project...but with respect.

But as we all know...if there's still run time, the villain ain't dead.

Just today, a message popped into the group chat. According to her, she had now ""listened to many suggestions"" and seemingly ""came to a following conclusion"":

My movie, except...a movie-clip compilation.

I am not joking.

Basically, the idea goes back on the idea of Manager 2. M2 is the opposite of Manager 1, by being very direct, but also fairy laissez-faire. His ideas are grounded on ""little work, much fun"" (literal quote). Which is rather understandable in itself: If you make something too complicated, it can become draining. Especially if you're not as passionate (or paid) for it.

So where's the problem? Well. M1 is putting them up against each other. We should ""both try out and look what we like more"". More specifically; she tries to ""kill"" my project by introducing the most mind-numbing simple idea, making my project seem too complicated in return. And I can say that with confidence, because...no offense to my colleagues, but they're more interested in ""playing movie"" than ""making movie"". So you gotta fun them up for everything. The ""winner"" is then suddenly our group project \[my title\].

Well. Jokes on her! I already know not only a way we can do both without competition, but also in a way that will actually help my movie! A way in which everyone can learn and gain passion for 70s movies & 70s! I will use the boards she puts up to build me a staircase to heaven!

477,Never building a PC again,11n1bfn,"Man, we fucking botched it. I recently bought basically a whole new PC setup, Graphicscard, CPU, Mainboard, PSU, everything. Today, we wanted to set it up. My father, mainly. I have very limited knowledge, but he technically has enough knowledge to know what to do. 

So we fumbled together all the pieces, tried turning it on-didn't work. Why? No idea. The screen stayed black, but the components were running. Sort of. So we think ""hey, maybe it's the GPU? So we set it up on a different rig. It seems to work here. We now know it must be something else. We try setting the new shit up again, still doesn't work. So maybe it's the Mainboard? So we use my old Mainboard and put the new Graphicscard on it. At first, it works. We then wanted to set it up on my room. When we try to, nothing seems to work anymore. The PC doesn't even turn on... So basically after trying around dozens of times, removing and adding all sorts of components, we now have not a single rig up and running. I basically cannot use my old rig anymore, no matter which specs we put in it, and the new one doesn't work either. My dad has lost all confidence in his capabilities and doesn't want to touch the things anymore. I am totally useless and feel incredibly helpless.

So wtf do we do? Order another new PC, but let it be pre-assembled? Earliest delivery for that is like almost a month away. Or do we screw around more, try some other dumb shit and end up destroying even my SSD with all of its content?

478,"I have a good life, but I just feel so inadequate.",11n0ji6,"I'm a 21 year old male. On paper, I have a great life. I'm about to get my bachelor's degree in August with a good GPA of like 3.4, then a year after that I will have a Master's degree and hopefully I will pass my CPA exam.

I'm working an internship at an accounting firm making $32 an hour while I am there, I have about $700 monthly expenses so the rest of it is going directly towards savings. Granted, I'm paying for my last year of schooling, and I might have to pay for my Master's degree which is roughly $10-15k, but I will probably have enough for it and even enough to take my CPA exam. Not to mention I am filling out scholarship applications in order to try and curb that amount.

I have a family who cares about me, if anything a little much because I feel slightly constrained by them. I have a brother who has got my back and will bend over backwards for me, if really necessary. I have a good friend who we constantly check up on each other, and constantly help each other out. I have a group of online friends that I don't talk to a lot but when I do, they are always pretty welcoming. Sure, one of them includes my former best friend though who I realized was just using me to vent. She left for 8 months after breaking up with another member in the group, and she came back recently, although it was only to try and get back with him, I thought it was because they missed or liked hanging out with me. That sucks, but it isn't a big deal.

I have a girlfriend that cares a lot about me. We have our issues though, we haven't had sex in like 2.5 months, and in the nearly 7 months we have been together, we have had sex probably 7ish times. I know we are busy, and with our parents in our homes it makes it kind of hard, but it doesn't even sound like she has the desire to have sex. In the few times we have an opportunity, she is always too tired, or she hasn't shaved, or she doesn't feel like it. Which is totally fine, I am not entitled to her body, but now I don't want to ask because I'm just getting rejected, I don't want to guilt or force her into it, so I'm waiting on her to ask. It's been a long time now. It feels worse considering she used to regularly have sex with a guy before we met. I feel inadequate.

Even when we have had sex though, it's bad. She took my virginity, so obviously I am bad at sex, but holy shit I did not think I would be this bad. She gets off most of the time, I have gotten off once. I know this is because I struggle from porn addiction. Before her, I used to get off everyday to my own hand, when I first got with her, that subsided a lot actually, but it didn't help. Now that it's been a long time, I've come back to using it all the time. How hard is it to fucking stop doing something? It seems so fucking easy, it makes me feel inadequate.

With my schooling, I feel so overwhelmed all the time, I'm trying to work 40 hours with my internship if possible, while also taking 4 classes, I'm doing the bare minimum in school, barely keeping up. If I don't work 40 hours though, I may not save enough to accomplish my schooling and CPA in a timely manner, I also want to make a good impression of my employer. I haven't read a single chapter of my accounting law book since the semester started; I got a B on the exam. I manage to pull it off by studying well I guess, but I don't know how I will replicate it. It's not a case of impostor syndrome because I don't believe my success is due to luck, but man I feel like I will fail at any second, it makes me feel inadequate.

My internship is so difficult. I don't know how I will actually make it in this field. I feel like I don't know what I am doing. Constantly annoying people with questions, make the progress of a snail, not sure how they don't realize how bad I am at this. And to think that at the end of the internship I was going to ask for a part time position while I go to school. I feel inadequate.

I recently got into an accident. It was my fault, I was not paying attention, looking out the window instead of the road, and rear-ended a guy going 20 mph, I tried to break and swerve, but I didn't slow down fast enough. I pushed him into another car, now I am responsible for both. Everyone is okay, but my god is it expensive. I have already paid $1000 to get my truck in working order, and that is not including the couple hundred dollar bumper I need to get, and the citation I need to show up to court for, and the raised insurance premiums I will need to pay. I also got my tires aligned, and it turns out my outer tire rod is torn, the end links need to be replaced, and the upper control arm is in bad shape, $885 fix. Even though, this tire stuff is in bad shape, I know it wasn't from the accident, that being said it is still draining my emergency fund. How could I not pay attention? It makes me feel inadequate.

Then because of this stupid self improvement mindset I try to have, I constantly internally question my friends and girlfriend to see if they are good for me. It gives me an us vs. them mindset and I hate it. For example, with my girlfriend, I try my best to help her out. Her dog is having behavior issues, I offer non-corrective solutions to try and help, and I try to help implement those solutions but she veers towards using corrective solutions. She has not learned how to drive yet so I drive her everywhere. I can't teach her because she has no vehicle to learn, and she can't use mine because my dad owns the vehicle, and it is too risky for him to allow her to learn. Her parents refuse to help her. I looked up that driving lessons in Las Vegas are $600 which is quite a lot, but worth it. It also looks good for insurance, and it means she doesn't have to buy a vehicle to learn, she can instead go straight to a motorcycle like she wants.

It's obviously a lot of money, but she does not save at all. I consider myself to be pretty good with money, so I offered to help her budget so she can slowly save up for it and make progress towards it, and at first she was willing but when we actually started she didn't want to. I'm not going to control her finances because it is not my place, so I have just left her to work on it. She hasn't made progress towards it, and is constantly stressed about it, and it bothers me because I want to help but she does not want my help. 

These kinds of issues bother me and make me wonder if we are a good fit together, but I know she is going through her own stuff, and who am I to judge what she does. I don't want to control her. She is probably going through more than I am (Like most people, they go through much worse than what I go through), and I know she is trying her best. I feel shitty for thinking this way because we are doing the best with what we are given, so who am I to deem her unworthy or something for doing the best that she can, and have it not be enough for me. I feel like a piece of shit for it, because I am sure I am doing things that bother her that I do not know about. Yet she talks about how I am the nicest guy she has ever dated and how I am always so sweet to her.

I'm scared to mention these things to her though, because she does not take criticism well, and she sometimes ""splits"" when I give her a lot of feedback about things that bother me because it makes her panic.

I love my girlfriend, I really do. So I don't know why my brain sabotages me with making me think we maybe shouldn't be together. I feel so lost, and I don't want to make a move because I feel like whatever move I make, I'm damned if I do or damned if I don't. This only adds to my feeling of inadequacy. I feel this way with my friends too, where I see things that make me question if they are good friends for me, but like cmon brain, they are doing the best they can as well. Who am I to judge them for that?

This doesn't even touch other topics, like how I can't get off my phone, I can't get myself to practice piano, I can't get myself to tell anyone these things because people think I have it together and everyone I know thinks I am so nice all the time when in reality I am always so mean to myself.

Yes, I know it's common. Yes, it's avoidable if you hoard all your stuff in your room. But that shouldn't be the norm. If people learned some basic decency when it comes to living with others and sharing spaces, it wouldn't be a problem!

People's belongings are specific to the individual because of necessity at times. What if they use specific cleaning supplies because they are allergic to certain chemicals? What if that item you accidentally broke is too expensive for them or you to replace. What if that food you ate was allergy friendly or dietary specific and now that person has to go hungry because allergen free/dietary stuff can be expensive! What if the cookware you used is no longer usable to the owner because you cross contaminated it with a food they can't eat!

If you need those things too, but can't get them on your own dime, there are resources for you! Food banks, free clothing drives, dishware and cookware, house essentials. These are all things that can be given to you for free if you can't afford them.

493,Struggling with my identity,11ml5w5,"Hi, I am an average 26 year old male and I don't know what I am.
Let it be career wise or relationship wise, I think I am just not being true to myself.
There are many things I follow because that's what parents or society expects but at the same time it has been burdensome.
Another thing I am like a liquid, I manage to change my personality to fit in with whoever I come across.

Sexual identity -
I have only been in a straight relationship that was ages ago. I am pretty sure I am straight but then it baffles me how for the past 10 years how I never ended up in another relationship.
I have tried light stuff with a male, but it just felt traumatic but still I get urges from time to time. Never felt a crush on any guy I know in real life though.
At the same time I also think I could be asexual. Or most likely a demisexual. Maybe could trans idk. 

Career-
I enjoy my job from time to time, I am certainly good at it. It pays decent and with work from home as become my comfort zone. Still I hate when on random days if I have to work 8+ hours. 
I have many hobbies- reading, drawing, exercising/running, gaming, learning languages but I am slightly above average in all. 
I just never end up pursuing one thing. 

Society /parents' / my expectations - 
I seem to follow these expectations for myself and it feels caged sometimes. 
Sometimes I just think I have two different personalities in me fighting for what they want. 

Friends/relationships-
I used to be a lonely person but that changed last year. I socialized, made friend and from that point on just kept making friends. 
Now I have some good friends whom I rely from time to time which is a good thing. 
But at the same time it annoys me that I made so many friends but how come none of them were not interested in me for relationships. 

Low self esteem - 
Why do I have low self esteem when I am better at most things than a normal person. 
I do not know. I wonder is it because I am not being true to myself. 


Life changing disease-
I was diagnosed with MDR TB few months ago, which changed many things for me. I have to be on medication for it for over the year and then hope it does not come back. 
But being diagnosed with this, although now I am free to socialize again the doubts keeps coming to my mind that I am Infectious and will never meet someone because of that. 

That was most of the rant. Thank you for reading if you did.

503,"In my homophobic family eyes, the LGBTQ+ are just as bad as pedophiles and people that does incest.",11mg1ob,"I was just testing waters again with my family so that I can come out, they started off just passionately shitting on the trans community. As buddhists, we believe in reincarnation, and we believe in karma. They believe that trans people and gay people are people who did terrible things in their past life and is punished by being in a body they aren't satisfied in, and it's unnatural.

So now I'll get to the main focus of the topic, I asked them why they can't just accept it and asked ""It's already there, it exists, people are doing it, shouldn't it be considered nnatural?"" and my father got pissed off at me and said,

""People are fucking children, it's already there, but it's not natural is it? Just because you can fuck your own mother you wouldn't because it's not natural is it?""

That comparison really hurt me to the bone, like fuck me, I just smiled and nodded. The conversation ruined my father's mood for the rest of the day as well which made me feel bad as well. 

It's made me question myself again, like it took a lot to settle my mind that it as okay to be bisexual, and it's okay to want to dress feminine, but the way he said those things really threw me back into a hole that I tried so hard to climb out of. I'm even questioning if I have the rights to judge incests and pedos now, like, am I really as low as them?

I'm trying to tell myself that I should have my own morales instead of adopting my family but what he said is just lingering with me. And I'm left with the choice between getting disowned by coming out or remaining a family by keeping it a secret. I mentioned it in a previous post, My family is great. Even thought they qualify as all three homophobe, racist and sexist they're the nicest people you can meet, as long as you don't get into politics which they will avoid. So between the choice of being a twink like I want to be and being a good son to my father's standards, I'd rather be a good son.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

Asked my father why he considers trans and gay people as unnatural when they already exist, doesn't that already mean it's natural, he replied with ""Pedophiles exists and we don't consider them natural, you can fuck your mother but you won't because it's not natural. Why should I consider these morons as natural."" Now I'm questioning if I have the rights to judge other people who I consider to be unnatural.",HorrorCriticism3433,2,2,0.67

511,I feel very unintelligent...,11m56r4,"when I say I feel unintelligent, I'm not saying that I don't know stuff, I certainly do, I know quite a bit about the subjects that I'm passionate about like. digital and tabletop games and digital art. but it feels like that's the only thing that I'm intelligent about. give me a subject about pokemon and I'll write a 5 page essay about why I like my favorite pokemon. but if you quizzed me about anything that's happening in the world or about any historical event or about pretty much any other subject that doesn't involve the stuff I like I'll just fall flat on my face.

it's not even just about world events. sometimes I can't spell english words correctly even though they are the most common words used ever. I spell ""enough"" as ""enouph"" because it just makes sense to me and I hate that I'm forced to correct myself every time I make that mistake. heck, I don't even capitalize my ""I's"" in my sentences.

I feel bad that I sometimes don't know anything about a subject that my friends are talking about.

I sometimes joke about how I genuinely don't know stuff. but the joke is actually true and it has been a common inside joke in my friend group.

there are even moments where I actually feel proud that there is something that I know that my other friends dont. like the time I had to solve a complicated Minecraft restone contraption that I actually managed to figure out. but once again, my knowledge about most things is almost exclusively about Games, drawing, and my job.

my friends talk about things almost as if it's common knowledge and it frustrates me that I don't know these things.

I feel like I represent the terrible American stereotype that everyone associates Americans with and it frustrates me so much.

sometimes I make stupid decisions simply because there is a factor in my decision-making that I never considered. like how I waited a week for my grandpa to take me grocery shopping when I could have just called my brother to drive me to my local aldi's if I needed something.

when I try something new I always find it confusing to learn because I have never done something like this before.

I can barely do basic math without the need for a calculator.

I can't get anywhere by myself because I don't have a car. this is because my parents didn't think I was responsible enough to drive a car. but if I learned how to drive then I would have been responsible enough to do those things.

my parents have to hold my hand through college because I don't know how to navigate the website or how to register or how to change the degree that I want to pursue.

I had an argument with a friend on how I thought mud was the same as dirt because mud was made from exclusively dirt and water.

I watch videos online all day and I feel like my brain is turning into mush.

Anyways she‚Äôs yelling and screaming at me at the gas station that I need to drive ‚Äúfaster you stupid bald fuck fuck your allah fuck you muslim fuck fuck you drive faster come on let‚Äôs fucking go‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam I‚Äôm not a Muslim, I just have a beard.

It hurt, so I punched her. I didn‚Äôt hit her as hard I as could. More like a fist bump into the face. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her, I‚Äôve spent over 10 years in anger management. I want to do my best to be a better person, and I did everything I could to hold it back and allow it to pass like my therapist said.

She stumbled backwards and had blood running down her nose, I turned around to get back into my car and go to a different gas station. Except I couldn‚Äôt, because she grabbed onto my arm and started hitting me on my back. I snapped and threw an extremely hard punch into her bloody nose. She fell on the ground screaming and crying. I got on top of her and started to choke her, and suddenly I realized what I was doing. I got off of her, she kept screaming, and I drove off and got gas about 20 miles down the road.

I‚Äôm shaking right now, I‚Äôve done so good to not let my anger get the best of me. I don‚Äôt understand what that lady‚Äôs problem was, I haven‚Äôt snapped in over 10 years.

However as soon as she got back, she sent a message to me and a few other friends asking if she could borrow some money. Saying she doesn't have enough to make it until payday

I said no, and I believe most of our other friends did too, but now she's mad because we ""true friends would have loaned her money"".

Or at least try to stay in a cheaper hotel or something.

524,I am absolutely repulsed by the amount of greed surrounding people's death when people think they're entitled to something.,11lwq8y," 

My mother passed away Monday night, and in the morning I was immediatelly bombarded by calls from ""relatives"" I never speak to ""inquiring"" about whether I have inherited something or not. The entire day was a fucking nightmare and I am absoulutely repulsed by the people surrounding my family and myself. THESE PEOPLE AREN'T EVEN RELATED OR FRIENDS WITH MY MOTHER.

With that out of the way, I'm going to tell you all what happened.

My relationship with my mother was complicated, but she tried to patch things up for the last few months and we started getting along. She told me she had four types of Cancer, 2 of them spreading quite fast, but everyione (hewrself included) was told she AT LEAST had 5 months to live, if not a few more years.

On Wednesday, I noticed my mother asn't responding to any of my calls and messages- That's when her best friend told me she was at the ICU, but that ""she would pull through"" and not to freak out. Hell, the doctros were ven convinced that she'd make it.

Escept she didn't. Monday evening, she passed away.

The next day, a very short service was held, as my family wanted to keep our affairs private- Still, the rumors spread like wildfire. I was so exhausted from crying when I returned, that I just crawled into my bed and fell asleep. While I was asleep, I was getting bombarded by calls and messages (though my phone was on mute). This didn't make me immune, though- As soon, my stepmother and paternal grandmother (people who haven't spoken to my mother in YEARS), proceeded to call my boyfriend and IMMEDIATELLY start asking about whether I inherited something, how much, etc.

My boyfriend said that what they were doing was completely inappropriate and started to ignore them. My grandmother got the messsage, but my stepmother? Oh no.

She proceeded to send him PARAGRAPHS and 10 minute long voicemails insulting him, insulting me, my brother, everything. My boyfriend had enough and contacted my brother (Who had cut off my stepmother completely), and basically said ""Hey, this woman is using burner phones to harrass your sister and ask about inheritances-"" Basically, he asked for help.

My brother did indeed help, but he might have taken it too far. He unblocked my stepmother and proceeded to rip her a new one, which resulted in her sending him a barrage of messages, saying things like:  
""Your mother didn't love you, she hired hitmen to kill you"" (Not true)  
""You were a failure as a son, no wonder she died hating you"" (Also not true)  
Among other vile, disgustiong things- Only changing her tune when she wanted to inquire about my possible inheritance. Oh, and a lot of death threats. SO MANY death threats.

These messages have all been saved and stored, in case we want to take legal action. This isn't the first time my stepmother tries to swoop in when she senses I'm vulnerable, only to go absolutely apeshit and say the most vile shit when she doesn't get what she wants. This includes, but is not limited to:  
""I hope you kill yourself"" (Said to me after being hospitalized after a suicide attempt)  
""Your boyfriend is a Narco (Because he has a single weed plant- which is legal where I live)""  
""You are a whore who fucks your boyfriend's friends for money because he's a pimp"" (Also not true)""  
""I will hire a hitman to kill you and your entire family"" (Doubtful,she definetly can't afford a hitman, at least)

I have her blocked completely, only my boyfriend had her unblocked in case something happened to my father and he needed any help. My boyfriend acts as a ""filter"" for her, because her calls and messages have triggered panic attacks in the past. I won't get into details about how abusive she is, but this should give you an idea about the type of person she is.

I'm so utterly baffled and disgusted at how people can be. They didn't speak of my mother, they didn't ask how I was, nothing- Just straight up started to ask about money that  
a) Is not confirmed that I'll even get and  
b) They are ABSOLUTELY NOT entitled to in ANY way.

534,I don't feel like I wanna get married,11lncsc,"The more I looked into my parents marriage, the more I feel like I don't wanna get married. So, I'm a woman in my 20s and most of my relatives already making jokes about me getting married. Annoying of course, but I ignore them for the most part. 

But now that I'm thinking about it, my dad always throw a tantrum over most ridiculous reasons like the food is hot or cold, way to salty or tasteless. He even throw tantrum when his things went missing. He get mad at my mum and my siblings. Sometimes he cursed and keep saying we just don't care about him etc. He's like the biggest baby I've seen. My mum, although has her own weaknesses, tried her best to keep him satisfied. There was this one time when my mom already cooked so much for him, but he said he don't want to eat it, because he wants something else. And said things like 'maybe I should just buy it from the restaurant' or 'I'll ask our neighbors to cook it for me'. Like wth was that. He acts like a five yo, and as a good wife, my mum started cooking another dish for him. Like, I sometimes pity her. She took care of my dad when he's sick, drove him to hospital, wait till 2/3 hours just to get his medicine. Like, I wish I can just punch the crap out of my dad. 

And seeing how my mom needs to babysit a husband like my dad, I sometimes feel like I don't wanna get married, because if that is a marriage, I rather die alone.",Dragonayre00,21,22,0.96
535,I feel like a background character or irrelevant‚Ä¶,11ln5pg,"Everyone is irrelevant to some degree, but i feel invisible at this point. Ive always felt lonely in this world and I‚Äôve always felt like my feelings are rarely understood by the people im supposed to trust, like my sister , family , any friend that i thought i made only to find out they never even liked me in the first place-
I‚Äôve always been in my sisters shadow and i still am, she loves me and ofc i love her back but you can see how that can get annoying. 

For example, my sister (T) owns a tattoo shop that i work at, i manage social media/online stuff.. i guess not as cool as being a tattoo artists like the other girls, but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm good at 
Anyway my coworker (J) was tattooing our shop neighbor (Z) who comes by often and vibes with us all sometimes 

At some point Z mentions someone and then goes ‚ÄúWhats her face knows her‚Äù.. im not really in the conversation so i stay doing what I‚Äôm doing on my laptop, but Z says louder ‚Äúwhat the fuck is her name..?‚Äù And J says a random name ‚Ä¶ Z goes ‚Äúnonono .. this bitch *points at me* T‚Äôs sister.. what the fuck is her name???‚Äù
I just kinda look at her with a blank stare, she goes ‚Äúyour name is ___? This whole time i never knew‚Äù

I just felt so irrelevant in that moment

I wish people cared about my existence 
I feel like I‚Äôm only relevant when I‚Äôm useful

Im so passively suicidal, i know I‚Äôm not gonna do it myself but maybe ill get lucky
I feel like I‚Äôve been chronically lonely my whole life, i felt just as misunderstood as i did when i was just a kid
I feel like they lied to me when they said it would get better because holy fuck it never did. 
My life isn‚Äôt inherently bad, i just have this gaping hole in my chest that can‚Äôt seem to be satisfied with how the world treats me
I constantly wonder if it‚Äôs the way i look, if it‚Äôs the way i dress, maybe my personality is obnoxious

First, I hold the unpopular opinion that USA-style suburbs and car-centric infrastructure are really the best infrastructure system, albeit with room for improvement for sustanibility (nature-preserving designs, more reasonable home sizes, electric cars, etc.) All the freedom of rural life with the perks of urban life. Kids can play outside unsupervised instead of becoming morbidly obese blobs; everyone can easily access nature and outdoor recreation as well as the perks of industrialized life. The freedom to go wherever you want, alone, on your terms, is amazing. It should be encouraged and made more sustainable, as the real problem, overpopulation, is addressed. So what if it‚Äôs ‚Äúinefficient‚Äù? I‚Äôm not going to give up my dignity, individuality, and quality of life so some corporate oligarch‚Äôs pockets can be fattened with the money they save. This is not the place to debate my personal preferences for place to live, or I swear, I will want to do unspeakable things to you.

Everyone‚Äôs entitled to their own opinions, but I CAN‚ÄôT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. Every day I hear about people trying to eliminate it and force all humans to live in dense cities with no freedom, nature, solitude, or individuality. Sharing walls with others and constantly having to be ‚Äúin public‚Äù would slowly cause me to lose my sanity. It‚Äôs an introvert‚Äôs hell and kills all personal freedom and individuality. Both living a blue-collar life in the country (because heaven forbid people live near nature to commune with it instead of strictly for work) or being in the city would be worse than death. The only multi-family housing I‚Äôll ever be in is a morgue, and the only public transit I‚Äôll rely on is a hearse.

\- My computer likes to stay asleep when I attempt to wake it up from its sleep

\- Been having a repetitive steam library bug/glitch, where the stem library tab slides down with the cursor, problem happens sometimes.

\- I decided to Factory reset Windows 11 in hopes to not just potential fix previous issues listed above, but to get my RGB LED working again on my motherboard.

\- All issues previous listed persist and did not get fixed

\- Microsoft Edge persuaded me to switch to Microsoft Edge (transferred all my data from google to edge).  I figured its less software you have to install seeing as you can't uninstall Microsoft edge + less setup hassle + giving it a chance.

\- Finished reinstalling everything

\- Creating shortcuts on windows 11 desktop is annoying/difficult.

\~ Played some games and went to bed \~

\~ Woke up and played some more games \~

\- After on and off, trial and error, while completing previous tasks. I finally fixed the permanent sleep problem: regedit > EnableULPS > 0

\- Installed specific RGB software: LEDs work for the first time in a few months (I then decide to turn them off).

\- Mood improves

\- Wallpaper Engine is somewhat taking up 95% of the CPU

\- The steam library sliding bug is worst; It's happening every time I open the library, I seem too unable to access the library at all.

\- Dread

\- Changed the wallpaper to a better looking and lower cpu cost background; problem fixed.

\~ went to bed \~

\- woke up

\- found a helpful steam thread; Steam > Settings > Interface and un-tick ""Enable GPU accelerated rendering in web views""

Despite my claims of saying I fixed the permanent sleeping issue. My computer may have had a hard time waking up this morning (I had to restart my computer)

Sure tube amps are a staple of classic music but solid state and digital technology has come so far that in a band context no one is gonna give a damn or notice you aren't using a tube amp. but of course guitar players look at something like the tone master and instantly are reduced to ""REEEEEEEE!

558,Sincerely fuck gym classes,11larzl,"As I learn more and more about physical fitness and try to improve myself, I get more and more mad about how I was introduced to the topic. While I'm sure gym class is great for some kids, it was more or less just a shame factory for me.

Firstly, I've never been that great at team sports, in part because of my lack of coordination. This kind of just created a feedback loop where I'm not getting much practice because I'm bad at sports. Took up weightlifting instead as an adult and it's wild how much less frustrating it is. They're really dropping the ball with girls' classes especially there. I think we only ever did one (1) class where we touched strength training, and yet we were expected to be able to do x number of push-ups. By the way, strength training is essential for maintaining your independence as you age. It's what will hopefully keep you off a walker when you're old.

Also being made to dance while the boys did wrestling, and aerobics while the boys did kickboxing, was its own kind of infuriating.

Another thing. Fuck fitness testing. You're not telling any of these kids anything they don't already know. It just promotes a bad relationship with your own body IMO, because you just start thinking of yourself as someone who Sucks At Fitness. Here I am, scoring Rs (Canadian equivalent of an F) in fitness because my resting heart rate is high, only to find out years later that I've had a heart condition the whole fucking time.

Speaking of! They don't even have cardio right! Effective cardio exercise is just at the stage of exertion where you can ""speak, but not sing."" There is no additional benefit to sprinting around a track unless you're trying to condition yourself to run marathons, which most of us aren't. Would rather not damage my knees further or feel like I'm about to die due to shortness of breath, thanks.

But now, she doesn‚Äôt invite me anywhere because she is hanging with her roommate (lets call the roomie K). Whenever I invite her somewhere she suggests K comes along and I have no problem with it, its just they exclude me from whatever we are doing. We went to Disney (all passholders) and i sat on a bench while K (lets call my friend C) and C got in line for a snack. I watched as K and C forgot about me and walked away. I got up and joined them but it looked clear like I wasn‚Äôt wanted. I suggested we go in a store because i wanted to look at the new merchandise. K and C said they would wait outside and i went in. I came out about 5 mins later as i didn‚Äôt buy anything and they was gone. I texted them and got no response. They went to the restroom. We met up again and watched a show. Leaving the show we got separated from the large crowd and I made my way to the entrance of the park to sit until they get there since the park was closing. It‚Äôs been an hour and i texted them to see what happened and if they was coming. No response. Then and hour and half. Nothing. The park was closing in 20mins so I went to the parking lot and sat by the car. It‚Äôs been two hours and nothing from them. 10mins after park closed they texted me saying that they was looking for me and how I was a burden not telling them where I went. But i did. It was a silent car ride and they immediately took me back home without asking if I wanted to still hangout. We haven‚Äôt hanged since then. 

I go on sm and saw that K and C hangout constantly without asking me. When I asked why they replied ‚Äúoh I thought you wouldn‚Äôt be interested in coming‚Äù which has never happened before.

I treat anywhere between 15-20 patients per day. I commute to multiple locations to cover shifts and work extra hours. I actually like helping people. And tbh I'm very satisfied whenever I see one of my patients get better. I do my damnedest to give them the best level of care. But my pay is so low. I work all these extra hours burning myself out because my base pay just isn't enough. I only make 19 an hour in a city. 

I make on average 1300-1400 bucks every two weeks with a rental cost of 1800 a month split between my partner and I. On average I work 55+ hours a week which doesn't include commuting to other locations. If I am able to work 5 12s in a week I make closer to 2100 in a pay period. But corporate has blocked me from working 12s because I've apparently worked ""too much"". A.K.A. I've taken too much of their fucking money. I have so many bills and expenses to pay constantly. Auto insurance, renters insurance, credit card bill, rent, utilities, phone bill, groceries, gas, etc. 

I'm also a socialist with a firm grasp of socioeconomic theory and social science in general. I understand why everything is bad. But I'm still so goddamn angry about it. It's even worse because I'm in a state that is super anti union. I've been trying to figure out which coworkers would support being unionized and striking because this is fucking ridiculous.

Some of those admin members are also the kids of the CEO and they get paid insanely well. Like several million a year while their dad makes even more.

594,I lost my dad last week and now I am the only male in the family,11kg22e,"Good day to everyone!

As the title says, I[31] lost my dad. I have a sister, mum and mum‚Äôs mum. Dad[57] earned good money and supported them. We think he had a stroke or something with the heart.

I understand alot has fallen on my shoulders. Maybe not to full extent but some. My sister[16] needs to be educated and before I thought she wanted to go to medical school and I already imagined this to be hard but possible to support her through it. Today I found she wants to be a singer superstar. I really hope this is a phase and don‚Äôt know how to talk to her about it. I do not want to discourage her but I also want her to have a good life. I said music is a great hobby. So I kept it at that. But honestly I felt really upset and angry. I have never even heard her sing. She has been attending private tutors for singing and piano for some while. Said she will participate in some contests in the next two years.

My mother earns minimum wage, I hope she gets to have some of father‚Äôs earned pension when the time comes. I said I will support her with money. She is being pessimistic but with my support they can be ok. I had other dreams but ok some things require sacrifice. Thankfully dad bought a nice, smaller apartment because it was too big for three of them and the utilities were very high. My dad worked in offshore so he would regularly be away. When he would be away me and mum would sometimes get into arguments I don‚Äôt even remember about what. When dad was home, we would have great relationship.

My gran, well, she is older so I think she can support me psychologically while I support the other two. First thing she said was that I have to become worthy of my father. My dad loved us very much and never abandoned.

I work away from them in a similar but psychologically harder job than my dad with much less pay and decided to stay working because I have been working here only for two weeks and I need the money. I come back in two months. I don‚Äôt know if I did the right thing but my gran says I did. Otherwise after a month I would need to look for another job.(Dad didn‚Äôt want a funeral/be burried I remember from childhood and mum also knows this, they agreed to have a farewell party when I come back). I hope I will manage to stay sane.

My dad paid my sister for reading books, she has a newer iPhone than me. I bought mine used. I hope she grows up normal and this financial hit  and loss of father won‚Äôt sabbotage her, get into alcohol or drugs or promiscuity.

My mum has two rescued dogs that are also female and they live a better life than some people.

I am not married and no kids. Life goes on. Today I already felt this being too much for me. As in they will drive me crazy. I want them good. I cry everyday a bit but after the biggest cry the tears don‚Äôt come so much. I dread that they will come when life gets really hard. I sometimes feel anger towards dad for dying. I want it to be alright.

626,I'm going to be very miserable until this semester ends,11jkpiy,"I can't make my college experience positive. I don't have a choice. I hate the college I'm at. I've tried to make it better than it's been (such as living at home instead of being at that awful college), and it's helped a bit, but not matter what I just can't get myself to feel ""ok"" when I'm at that college. I really don't have a choice here, at least a full choice. There's some things I can do to make it better but there's some things I can't control, like the fact that I just feel awful being at my college.

I'm still going to be miserable after college (due to depression and other conditions) but at least I'll have more of an ability to control my life then. When I graduate. I.e. I can choose which jobs I want to work (if I get hired at them, it's not a guaranteed I'll be able to work where I want. But at least if I don't like a particular kind of field I don't have to work in it). Also maybe I can go find a workplace I think I'd like and ""test it out"" being there before I actually think about applying there, if I do want to work there. Like if I wanted to go work at a restaurant I can go eat there first to somewhat see if I'd actually be okay with working there potentially.

But here with college I'm just about done. I COULD drop out if I wanted to but why would I do that. So I'm pretty much stuck here commuting to this place I hate for another two months. And I hate when people say that ""it's almost over, you're almost there."" True, but I STILL have to deal with going there for another two months. Like that's still a thing, even if I am close to the finish line. So honestly this is going to suck for the next two months.

There's nothing I can do to make myself like being at that campus. I've lived there and been going there since 2021, and I've never liked it. I honestly wouldn't know how to make myself like being there, so I guess I'm just stuck hating this place for two more months. It really sucks having to go there.",DryCoast,1,3,1.0
627,My coworker made up an engagement to steal my thunder,11jklcq,"I work in a small office where me and my coworker are the same title but she has slightly more responsibility. She is old enough to be my mother and generally treats me like her child, her oldest being 5 years younger than me. I had worked for the company for a few years before she got hired but we both started in that office within months of each other. (she actually screwed me out of a promotion because she knew someone and then claims she's the reason i got hired lol) 

I am finding it hard to find any peace working with her and after a year i think I've finally hit my breaking point after she has now made it clear that she has no shame and will stop at nothing to steal any attention possible. You wouldn't think that we could end up in a one upping competition because there are a few decades between us and we are in different parts in our life but every time i do anything, suddenly she is also doing that thing. It started off innocently. I would eat something for lunch and then she'd go buy it and claim to have always liked it even though it's not a well liked food. I'd wear a scarf, suddenly half way through the day she puts on an attention grabbing scarf she had in her desk and everyone starts talking about it. I got flowers delivered to my work, suddenly she has a bigger bouquet delivered two days later. Then instead of people complimenting my flowers anymore, everyone points out how we both have flowers. It kept happening until i eventually accepted that I'm not imagining it and it wasn't just because we work together, she intentionally was trying to do what i did and even one-up me.  

Fast forward to now, my bf and i planned a trip to France and we chose there because i always wanted to get engaged in france (i know i was shocked he agreed lol) we started dating 6 months before my coworker started dating her bf. He moved to my area to permanently be together right when i started my new job. My coworker broke things off with her bf, after a couple dates, when i started working with her and it wasn't until i started talking about my bf moving there to be with me and my relationship (because i was in puppy love) that suddenly she got back together with this guy. Anyways, she knew that we were going to France next month to get engaged. I've been asking her for months what her plans with her bf were. (Because I was worried she would try to get engaged at the same time as me) She has said since i met her she is never going to get married again. Not willing to risk her house or savings. And they broke up a month ago because his kids and her hate each other. They got back together and acted like it didn't happen and apparently he chose her over his kids. 

So my timeline is get engaged at the end of march, get married at the end of June. (It has to be a quick engagement because my bf is in the military and will be relocated over the summer). She knew both of these things. When i came into work this week she started telling everyone how she got just engaged. Her bf had asked her to.....move in with him. So she is going around saying how they are getting rings and they aren't having a wedding because theyre not even getting married. But she's ""engaged"" and he ""proposed"". When do you think she's moving? A week after my wedding. So the few people i told that I'm going to be getting engaged next month have been calling it ""the office of love"" and intertwining our ""engagements"". I thought again...maybe I'm just imagining it. But then when she started telling people, she started bringing up me going to France at the same time to try to get me to say I'm getting engaged too. Her friend at work even told me ""you're next"". She literally couldn't let me have this. She had to make up an engagement so she could steal my thunder. And then when my wedding comes around she is going to bring up how's she's moving houses. When she talks about her engagement everyone is confused AF because if you're not going to get married and you're not moving until July then why are you telling everyone you're engaged right now or even using the term engaged, especially when you know I'm actually getting engaged this month. 

My coworkers, that actually know how she is, think she's a narcissist and i had my doubts but i truly don't know what else to think about this. She has mentioned a few times that she used to dye her hair my color and that she feels threatened by working with someone so much younger (we make the same amount of money) so i thought she was just a little jealous but I'm starting to see just how vindictive she is. It is draining my soul to constantly be talked over, copied, and talked to like a child (she does this to everyone not just me) to the point where I'm considering switching offices. I just had to get this off my chest.",throwaway_4secrets,1,1,1.0
628,I dont rlly get relationships or marriage,11jkfae,"I dont rlly understand how someone would spend their entire life with someone. How two ppl can trust eachother sm without one betraying the other. I‚Äôve never experienced/seen a relationship that lasts forever and the both of them genuinely love eachother, irl at least. Most ppl just date for flings and etc(from what ive seen). Which I also dont get either. If not dating to marry, why date? Why be unfaithful or shit in a relationship, why not just break up? What if the other person gets tired of you? Ive seen so many posts of failed relationship and now im lowkey scared of anything happening. Marriage (usually) involves kids, but I dont want kids. What if i eventually get drained or what if my s/o eventually gets drained and regrets ever being with me. Ik I would forever remain loyal to someone if I truly love them and stay by their sides no matter what but how can I know the other person feels the same way. Dont get me wrong, I do have crushes. I just cant imagine dating them. Well I can, but I would never. I would never confess to someone or accept a confession. My personality isnt too bad and despite my looks not being great, I have had ppl like me. So it isnt about not being able to pull either. Also another part im scared of is me being unlovable. Im mentally ill(not like the insane type) so i have a lot of issues. From this post u can partially see trust issues and abandonment issues. As well, my mental state isnt rlly good to be able to tolerate someone or at least believing someone is able to tolerate me. Besides mentally, I also think im physically unloveable. I have so many physical issues that ion think anyone can not feel disgusted if they know bout em. Im not just saying this cause im insecure, i actually accept when i think im pretty and know im not the worst looking. Its just the things wrong with my face and body are too much that i dont even think I would date myself. If a s/o somehow liked my personality and tolerated me they would run away by my looks. Once again, my overall looks and personality arent too bad since some ppl do like me (who ive never talked to or have). Its just the little things (physically)that suck. So firstly I dont understand relationships bc trust, etc. As well, a part of me not understanding relationships is bc i think im unlovable. Based on my writing u prob can tell im in highschool lmao, but can anyone tell me their love stories. Kinda need it bc my friends think im weird for having this mindset. They asked me ‚ÄúWell what sbout you having a crush on ___?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI wouldnt date them‚Äù ‚ÄúIsnt that just leading them on? thats fked up‚Äù ‚ÄúNope!

641,Being able to sleep would be nice.,11j4q3u,"I work nights (Sunday night/Monday morning - Thursday nignt/Friday morning). I started my work life on days but found my sleeping issues just couldn't keep up. I was always more of a nights person throughout my teen years and I'd be awake until the early hours of the morning, not tired in the slightest and then need to be up for work before getting chance to sleep. When I changed over to nights I figured it'd be a better fit. I wouldn't need to adjust my sleep schedule and I get more money. Win win.

I've had this job for four months and in that time I've taken about a week and a half off cumulatively because I'm just not getting enough sleep.

 Currently the plan is go to bed at 8am, wake up at 6pm, leave for work at 8:30pm get there for 10, work until 6am, get home for 7:30. It doesn't leave me much personal time due to the long commute but at least I'm getting my 8 hours. But that almost never plays out. I get 4 hours some days which usually means I can work, albeit tired and then get my full 8 the following day, then back to 4 and it repeats.

The most frustrating part is it doesn't even feel like I'm doing anything wrong. I take some sleeping pills and get into bed as soon as I come home. I don't even turn anything on, just stick my phone on charge across the room and lie there with my eyes closed. But I just can't fucking sleep. It's currently 5:50pm. I've been lying in bed for 7 hours, 50 minutes and nothing. Not even a minute of sleep.

Of course now that it's too late for me to get any sleep at all, I'm suddenly the sleepiest man on earth. Heavy eyelids, steady breathing the whole nine yards but if I sleep now it means another day off. Another day I don't get paid for and another day closer to my boss just saying ""you've taken too much time off"" and firing me.

I think the biggest fuck you was the end of last week. I finished work on Wednesday morning after working a shift on 4 hours sleep only to be awake until about 5:30. I knew this because I could hear my partner coming home from work. Finally fell asleep only to be woken up half an hour later. I said fuck it and went to work anyway getting comments about how pale I am and how dark my eyes are and almost falling asleep on the job, knowing for sure that being this tired would guarantee that when I get into bed I'd be straight asleep. I was awake long enough for my alarm to go off. I'd been awake for over a day.

 I ended up calling in saying I wouldn't make it and went to sleep until 4am. I spent my entire weekend trying to recover my sleep schedule, failing miserably. 

It genuinely feels like the only thing I'm allowed to do is go to work. Even assuming I get my proper sleep it leaves me with enough time to; shower, get food, get dressed, brush teeth and go. My weekends are spent trying to play catch up leaving me no time for friends, family and other leisure.

Me and my friend walked up to the machine and started playing songs and I noticed in the glider of my eyes the girl I was hitting it off and also the girl my friend was hitting it off with, and we completely don‚Äôt acknowledge them because they are with this group of people and we wanted to hear the music we payed for, and behind our back the girl my friend was talking to keep saying ‚Äúthese guys are babys‚Äù a joke she made about us 21 and started lying to the guys she was with saying stuff about how I guess we made her uncomfortable or some kinda of that sorts, and she kept telling the man she was with at the time to not talk to us and stuff like that, so I decided to kill him, with kindness and he jokingly asked me for a dollar at the jukebox where I was playing a song, and tried to give him one he said no, so I offer to play a song and this is ui I‚Äôm sorry, just so pissed and drunk.",Germanistic,0,1,0.6

657,"Rant about being a woman, and how it feels",11imy0g,"This is just a rant to get this out. I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot, and I think I‚Äôm writing this more for myself than anyone else.


Why do so many women (including myself) lose themselves in guys. I thought maybe it‚Äôs just me, but then I talk to friends, see posts, and tiktoks, and while not everyone‚Äôs like this it saddens me to see it.


Perhaps this is just some obvious revelation I have now came to as I‚Äôve gotten older, but it really makes me sad. The lengths women go just to impress a guy. I saw a tiktok of some girl trying to do her makeup like her boyfriends Instagram crush and it makes me so actually sad. Maybe because I deep down related to it. I‚Äôve sat in front of a mirror loathing myself for not looking like his pretty blonde ex-girlfriend. I have friends who have absolutely hated how they looked and changed so much about their appearance just for male validation. Why do we do so much why do we crave it. 


Maybe it‚Äôs just me. I know not everyone‚Äôs like this; but simultaneously I know so many other girls that are the same way. Your mood, your day determined by the amount of times he texts you or snaps you. You base your self worth off of the amount of attention you receive. You lose a part of yourself within them. I always see girls online talking about how their different now. As if their ambitions have been curbed, their motivations gone as their sole focus is only on their partner. It makes me so sad. Quite literally Cassie from euphoria, where she spends hours getting ready only to not be noticed. What‚Äôs the equivalent of this for guys? I‚Äôm sure guys have felt the same way, but why; why does this awful feeling of dread come with being a girl. 


Before I met my current boyfriend I was so infatuated with my own life, and so focused, now I feel like such a husk of my former self. How do I get it back? I know obviously when you have someone close in your life they become your priority, and your lives can intertwine, but why is it that the guys life for me at least always seemingly marches forward. I feel like the girls always have to compromise something. If they wanted to receive more attention, they have to beg, and maybe they‚Äôll get it, I just feel as if their always more self-sacrificing. It crushes me. Sometimes their self-sacrificing without being asked. How girls spend hours of their time just trying to look the part for a guy or do something to show they care. They do it without being asked, so you can‚Äôt blame the guy for not having a reaction, but it‚Äôs disheartening the lengths women would go for just the slightest bit of anything. 


Obviously I‚Äôm biased this is just me and the things I see online, and my friends, so by no means is it accurate, and if you‚Äôre a guy, is it like this for you too? Is it that just men show less emotion? Why, why is this such a common theme it hurts my heart, seeing these amazing, beautiful women give up so much for so little. Is it the way we‚Äôre wired? Is it what‚Äôs societally accepted? I just am frusterated with seeing this. It makes me sad‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all.",Lumeriia,2,1,0.6

The american insurance industry makes the process of therapists accepting insurance an incredibly hard and drawn out process which is why many don‚Äôt accept it, especially if they aren‚Äôt part of a bigger practice. 

I feel like just quitting therapy all together at this point. The thought of going through all of my past and current traumas again with a new person sounds like hell.

The end project of our school should've been in groups of 2, guess who's alone even though we have an even number of students in our class! 

I've been called fat my entire life, I've been teased because of it, shut out during PE because of it. Because of them I have an unhealthy relationship with food and lost 25 kg in less than a fucking year because I kept starving myself! 

The love of my life and best friend rejected me and is currently ruining my life. I did everything for her: bought her thoughtful presents, took her out for fun stuff, supported her in her darker moments and now she's telling everyone that I'm a terrible human! Shes telling everyone that I'm a stalker, I HAVENT SEEN HER IN 7 FUCKING WEEKS AND SHES STILL SAYING THAT! 

Family tell me I'm too skinny now, colleagues tell me I should change my haircut (Wich I've done 5 times in a year already!), My sister tells me I should take care of my acne. Guess what! I'm trying!! I keep up with my hygiene, try to dress nice! And can everyone stop saying I should ""loose the glasses"", well guess what idiots! I can't fucking see without them!

664,I was adopted and physically abused with my brother. Eventually I left home and at a family christmas party beat up my adopted father/abuser.,11ieo9b," 

Been going through my head (probably because this is close to the time he died) But wont make it a dramatically long story and I know tons of others have gone through the same shit. My mother had me when she was 15, so I was put up for adoption. I was adopted into an extremely abusive house hold. My father was a police officer. And he would come home if his day at work was bad and make me and my brother put out our ""arms"" The first one who couldn't keep holding their arms out would be beaten. Commonly my brother being 3 years younger would fail this, so sometimes i'd drop my arms face to relieve the pressure off him despite it meaning a beating for us.

We couldn't watch cartoons my father disliked. So if he came in and we had simpsons on it was a beating he didn't enjoy this show. Likewise expressing an opinion was something ""Negative"" if you even liked a song he didn't like you was an idiot a moron and thick. The abuse was just insane at times so it was pretty much stay in your room to avoid this. Mother it was more ""mentally"" abusive. You would get things like no one likes you, no friends, your shit at everything etc. All the usual crap.

Anyway I think the biggest shocker to me was how many of my family turned a blind eye to this, From aunts/uncles grand parents. I remember on an occasion having my head busted open, once nearly having my arm broke at around 9 from a arm bar, social services were around a few times but nothing ever happened. I was hardly ever fed and at 15 I remember being less then 8 stone (112lbs) So yeah life was shit. My escape was boxing/martial arts. I wont go off topic with anything negative or bad I got involved with sexual wise or the wrong people. But evidently it happened also.

Anyway fast forward till I was 28 I got away from all this shit, I was in a relationship at the time. Life was better I had money, I was financially in a very good place. I had messed up in the head issues. But I was obviously much happier. I had disowned a lot of my family but there was still some I had a relationship with.

One being one of my aunts she was much older in fact she was turning 80. So some family had rented this building, it had all the usual stuff like a hall with tables, food etc, catering service. Anyway my adopted mother and father who I had not spoke to in years and had been assured would not be there of course were. To cut a long story short the minute they arrive my mother came over going on a tirade of how I ruined her life adopting me was the worst thing in the world. How i'd cost them money to raise me (they got money for adopting me lol) Tons of other shit. I walked away despite the anger at the situation due to what we were here for and told my girlfriend.

My mother followed over again and continued up about how awful I was causing a scene. I told her properly look ""Fuck off Or I will slap you harder then I ever was a kid by you got it?"" she went silent and my Adopted Father spoke up ""JUST LIKE YOU"" I turned towards him and said Look shut up now because when i'm telling you I will beat you to an inch of your life I am not fucking joking."" He looked shocked but didn't stop. They followed me around most of the time there making jabs and insulting me to people telling fake stories about me to everyone and how awful I was.

Eventually we all ended up sitting down for ""food"" A cake was brought out for my aunt. Id been dragged to the side numerous times asking if I was ok by different people. even a few ""What the fuck"" Like people came up and said all I could say was what the fuck just happened what are they doing?

Anyway we were all eating and they started up again, I can't remember what it was, but it was about an issue I had with a friend of my mothers (female) who was involved sexually with me when I was very very young. My adopted mother knew this. Even when her friend was charged with doing it to her own kids. But obviously i'd ""Made it up"" lol. Anyway they began a mockery of me with it bringing it up before making jokes/lies about stories they had done where i'd been beaten as a kid.

I remember everyone being silent during most of it and doing ""silly jokes"" trying to change the subject until I finally spoke up. You use to slap shit out of me and my brother as a kid Ruined our lives. If only people knew half the shit you did to me. He denied it of course and I said something like ""what child hood? I didn't have one you two ruined it"" Blah blah it went on and he kept insulting me. I lost it I got up and and just ran/jumped over. I smashed my father off his chair like he had done to us a 100 times a kid. Knocking him to the floor I grabbed him by his head and smashed him in the face before choking him. During it I remember him looking up at me as my adopted mother ""screamed"" I remember I threatened she would be next. But the part that made me the most angry and pissed me off the most was when he looked at me and he goes ""Please kid stop..."" I remember being furst and I put my arms around his throat and smashed him back down. If me or my brother said please or stop he go crazy. I remember he burned our hand on the stove and everything over it. ""You never ask for it to stop you have to learn to behave"" So the fact he did this just caused me to lose it more.

Eventually Obviously I stopped he had passed out I got up. Everyone was starring, I expected the police to be phoned given it was such a public place but nothing happened. Everyone pretty much knew/believed all the abuse stories were true. Especially as my adopted mother was apologising during it. I got up and left. Never spoke to 95% of my family after. Had tons of text messages asking me if I was ok. I removed most from facebook, instagram any form of social media. and found myself in a much better happier place and never looked back since.

666,"I hate living my life as a natural redhead, but I love my hair color.",11id4gy,"I (20f) am a natural redhead since both of my parents were strawberry blonde/redhead themselves.

I‚Äôve always despised the attention I get for being a redhead, cause I honestly hate standing out and some of the attention I get is *super* weird.

I cannot go a week without someone sexualizing me. The constant ‚ÄúDo the carpets match the drapes?‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard gingers are freaks in bed, is that true?‚Äù, and more. I first started receiving sexual comments like those when I was 8. I hadn‚Äôt even hit puberty yet and still had literal creeps making inappropriate comments towards me. 

I‚Äôve had my fair share of random people touching me and my hair without my permission. I‚Äôve had a older lady literally chop about 2 inches off my hair when I was in a Walmart before. Her reasoning? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just such a beautiful color..‚Äù Whatever, you can think that, but that‚Äôs too far. I had a whole breakdown in my car afterwards since I had a big chunk of my hair missing.

Gingers also tend to be made as a joke often too. There are the jokes like ‚ÄúYou have no soul‚Äù, ‚ÄúDevils spawn‚Äù, etc. and I can get behind those sometimes since it‚Äôs like dark humor. But I hate when random people think it‚Äôs okay to come up to me and make fun of me for my hair. Everyone‚Äôs humor is different, so you can‚Äôt expect to make a hateful ginger joke towards a natural ginger and them to always laugh/go along with it. Some of us gingers were relentlessly bullied growing up and those jokes can really make us feel insecure.

But what bothers me the most about being a natural ginger? It‚Äôs whenever you try to express your feelings for being upset with the way you‚Äôre treated by the world, you just get made into a bigger joke. No one wants to take you seriously. They just tell you ‚ÄúWell, if you don‚Äôt like it, then dye your hair‚Äù. The thing is, I really do like my hair color, I‚Äôm very happy with it, but I don‚Äôt want to change it because of the harassment. Why should I give in and dye my hair so the harassment stops?

Like is it really that hard for you to let other drivers around know that you are going to turn? Or change lanes?

A lot of people on social media, in communities, local law enforcement etc all complain about people who speed and the risks to themselves, pedestrians and other drivers. But rarely do people talk about people not using indicators and the increased likelihood of a collision. 

Rolling through a stop sign can get you a huge ticket. Running a red can get you ticket. Playing your music to loud in the car can get you a ticket. But not using your indicator while changing lanes or turning? ‚ÄúOther drives should just have to pay more attention and have better reaction times‚Äù

I have lost count how many times I have narrowly avoided a collision because some POS didn‚Äôt use an indicator and more than likely didn‚Äôt look and then start merging into my lane.

That‚Äôs some bullshit. Spending thousands of dollars on a single game is absolutely ridiculous, and people need to stop enabling each other. Especially when most of the time that money is being spent for A CHANCE at something you want, not the actual thing.

680,My middle aged mother annoys me with her inability to understand my explanations,11hyn0q,"My mum misplaced her health insurance card and has physiotherapy tomorrow. I spent several minutes explaining to her that you are still able to make a claim without the card, but need to pay the full amount then they reimburse you. I told her I would do the claim myself online for her since she sucks at using computers. She was still confused. 

I then gave her an example of how the Australian government funded Medicare works. She has previously made claims with Medicare, so I know this example is familiar. I said that sometimes you pay the reduced amount straight away, but other times you pay the whole amount then make a claim with Medicare to get some money back.

After several minutes of explaining and her still not getting it, I wrote down exactly what I said and said show this to your physiotherapist. She still could not understand and said the physiotherapist would want the card.

After getting fed up, I started to raise my voice. Then to just get out of the conversation, I just handed her my health insurance card and just said claim it under my name. I have also attended this physiotherapist but was told that now I am a lot better and only need to go when I am feeling a lot worse. As the physiotherapist has a good relationship with my family he said that if I had excess sessions that were unused he could just claim it under my name, so mum does not have to pay.

So to sum up I will not have my health insurance card until the next week I visit my parents. But it's ok as I don't plan on using it right now.

Question for everyone reading- does my explanation make sense to you guys or do you all think that I explained the concept poorly to my mum?",mirrorreflex,0,2,1.0
681,"I thought sedation dentistry would be the answer, apparently not.",11hy8sl,"They were kind to me, but this was not a great experience. I avoided going to the dentist for YEARS because I hate the noise, the closeness of people to me, the pain, and all of it. And most of all, I hate needles. So, I found a dentist who does sedation. Their office is wonderful, and the staff assured me they would give me meds to take before the night before and the morning of appointment so I wouldn‚Äôt care and my boyfriend would stay with me until I was comfortable. They said I wouldn‚Äôt even know when they put the IV in. I took the meds I was supposed to the night before and the morning of.

By the time we got there, I didn‚Äôt feel any less anxious than normal. And they called my name, but told me I couldn‚Äôt bring anyone with me because there isn‚Äôt any room. I wanted to leave right then and there. I really considered it. But I didn‚Äôt, figuring if it was bad enough, I‚Äôd be able to run away later.

She was none too slow to get me in the chair and put this nitrous thing on me (that makes SO MUCH noise). And she shot something in my mouth that tasted terrible and sprinkled something under my tongue. And then told me I‚Äôd feel relaxed soon. 10 minutes later, I didn‚Äôt. So she shot more stuff in my mouth and poured my stuff under my tongue. I still didn‚Äôt feel much better. But they decided to get the IV started anyway. They missed twice. 

After that, it‚Äôs spotty, but I remember them putting things in my mouth that just kept hurting. 

I know it‚Äôs probably not their fault and I‚Äôm just not sure how to have an experience at the dentist that doesn‚Äôt leave me in anxiety shambles.",QueenOfPenguins18,1,3,1.0

688,Fuck Racism,11hsnox,"I've been dating my girlfriend for over a year and a half now. I'm a white man while she's a mixed women with black and white heritage. While I've never had the misfortune of experiencing racism, I know some family and friends who have. I know she has too. And because I, a white man, date her, I get to hear some of the racist shit people say about us.

I grew up in a mostly white town. Think 98% white people. A real breeding grow for racism. One of my friends in high school was black and I remember some of the redneck shitheads calling him a n*****r and taunting him. I also remember him getting into trouble for knocking the lights out of this one kid.

My cousin is mixed. White dad, black mom. I remember my uncle finding a watermelon smashed in the back wind of his car. You don't throw a watermelon into the back of someone's car with one of the only mixed sons in the town for no reason. It was reported as a hate crime but was never a closed case.

So now leads to my girlfriend. Love her to bits. We don't really talk about race outside talking about ancestry (we like to compare our 23andme origins for fun if the data gets updated). But tonight we talked a bit about racism after talking about going to other countries and how nationality and race play a factor.

She's been adopted by an older white couple when she was born. Obviously, she was raised in a white culture, but it doesn't take away from the racism she faces from both white and black people. She's had to deal with the traditional white racism. Like when her friend's parents liked her because she didn't ""act black"" and normally didn't like black people at all. She's considered ""different"" from black people. And then there are black people who hate that she's mixed and don't see her facing the problems someone with predominantly black ancestry has.

And I've seen it while dating her as well. While she wasn't around, I've had people automatically call her black (even though I tell them she prefers mixed). And I mean, if we're going to be technical in their definition, she has more white ancestry so wouldn't she be considered white? I've also had a black man say to ""leave the black women to the black men"" to me. Told him to get fucked.

Not an entire list, but I just wanted to explain this. Racism gets talked about a lot in this country, but I don't think there's a big focus on mix racial couples or mixed people. They're either inbred confederate fucks or Malcolm X douchebags. Either way, they prioritize keeping us apart because of our skin colors. And furthermore, I wish she didn't have to deal with this shit. Only reason why I'm so in shock is because I don't have to deal with this and haven't had to as much as she has. And she doesn't deserve any of this because she's a very sweet and cheerful person.

690,I‚Äôm on the verge of collapsing and doing something I‚Äôll regret,11hs5xm,"So about 2 weeks ago I went to a funeral where i parked the car in a street in-front of a closed shutter shop which turned out to be a garage and someone had his car parked inside. After the funeral i got a call from my relative that i parked in front of a garage and i need to move my car as this other person is waiting for me. 
I quickly went there and was about to enter my car to move it when this guy started arguing with me. I told him I didn‚Äôt know this was a garage and i just came here from another city to attend this funeral but he didn‚Äôt listen and kept getting angry and told me to get in the fucking car and move it. I tried to calm him down but he was acting so weird. He was with his family. 
Now, i have no idea how I contained my anger and didn‚Äôt react as i was quite trying to access what‚Äôs happening. He even knocked my car‚Äôs window which made me lose my mind. His family members kept stopping him but he won‚Äôt listen. 
I was alone and shaking with anger and cursing myself that why I didn‚Äôt have my gun with me today, which is definitely a good thing because out of anger I might‚Äôve shot him without a second thought and then would‚Äôve regretted later for killing someone on such a small matter. 

Now the problem; I still can‚Äôt get this out of my head. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this. I just want to find him and shoot his face so many times that he would be unrecognizable.

691,I Mean...Okay But...,11hqu60,"So a friend I've known for almost 2 years decided to lend me his 55 inch TV. He said he didn't feel comfortable with me having a 24 inch TV.

So the TV doesn't have Bluetooth and it's a Ruko TV. My TV does have Bluetooth and it's Amazon Powered.  Amazon gave me a Fire Stick (Lite)  for no reason at all.

He came over with the TV and I was the one who had to carry it from his SUV into the house.  I had everything unplugged and was ready. Easy set up and plugging everything back in. He said he wanted to watch a new movie that just came out.

Wait, it's Ruko Powered, have to find an app . Plug my USB in, nothing happens. He tells me he should have brought over his Movie Box but he said I told him no. I didn't. Argument over that. I said how old is it. He said he got it back in 2012. Did you have to update it? He doesn't know, doesn't know anything about anything. I explained it to him. After I finished... 'See, if you had agreed to let me bring it over, you would not be having this problem.'  That's when I lost my shit. 

I tell him..' Who let's someone 'borrow' a 55 inch TV for no apparent reason. I mean I'm comfortable with what I have and I didn't want to hurt your feelings but why are you leading this to me. I didn't ask for it, I can afford a 60 inch refurbished, it's under $300. I don't need something this big, I'm okay with what I have it for.' He then tells me why he is lending it to me.

I purchased him a Chromebook because he wanted to buy one of the 2 extra laptops I had. One, Windows based was slow and the Chromebook, the battery won't hold a charge. I saw online Chromebooks for $99, so I got him one. But the TV he is letting me use, I have to give it back.

694,My molester is moving back in,11hly0s,"I am stuck living with my parents as I cannot afford any rentals where I am from- both the money that my wife and I make together is not enough to pay for any rentals that are nearby and we cant get a job anywhere else because of our low pay. So- we are stuck living with my parents, which isnt so bad since they are kind and supportive. Although, we have a small issue with my mom- since she constantly keeps supporting my brother after everything he did.

Here is some context, I will do my best to make it brief (but its a lot). I will start off with what he did to me and then what he did to everyone else (kind of chronologically). My brother used to beat me and verbally abuse me when I was little- I would have bruises all over my body and it took me several years of my adulthood to get out of the mentality of ""No one wants you"". My brother molested me, in which I kept my mouth shut, locked away the memory, until it came back a few years ago in a horrible nightmare (I relived it, and I have moments where I relive it, even awake, and just sob). After he moved out, he got a woman pregnant, married her, abused the child, got a divorce, and tossed the poor child onto my parents care. He has no remorse for these things, and personally believe he is a good person and will say you are ""Anti-LGBT"" if you disagree with him or call him out on anything he has done wrong. 

Though, you are probably asking yourself- why is he moving back in? Why would someone that horrible move back in? Well the answer may shock you: my mother has family issues from her losing her parents at a young age and will do anything for her children (except keep her child's molester away from her and her grandchild that she has custody of). My brother needs a place to stay after his second marriage had fallen apart because he cheated on his wife and she found out he was a manipulative asshole (He told her that her family were horrible people and she needed to stay away from them). So- they are clearing up a shed and he is moving back until he can get enough money to move out. 

Where is my dad in this? He continues to protest but my mother keeps steamrolling past him on the decisions. My wife thinks that if this continues a divorce may happen. I hate to admit it, but I see it too.

This horrible news was told to me before my shift at work, and the move is this Sunday (two days from now). I have told my wife that my mother doing this will have lasting effects on our relationship as- She has chosen one child's wellbeing over another and her own grandchild as well. The only thing I can do now is just hope he has a car accident so he cant continue to hurt my family anymore. I am seething, shaking, feeling hopeless, and on the verge of tears. The only person I can cry to is my wife, but I feel that posting this rant here will at least make me feel that I have somehow shouted out publicly, ""This person is my molester, I am not okay"".",7Stargazer77,28,21,0.87

701,How Do I Stop Being Obsessive? How Do I Move On?,11hgn7j,"Hey y'all,
These past 3-4ish years have been a ride of ups and downs. A relationship I was in, my first ever real real one, was a difficult one and did not end in the cleanest fashion. A lot of ambiguity in our feelings for eachother and a weird on and off again thing after we stopped being official and her moving on has left me with a lot of mental scarring that feels like it never has fully healed.
It's been such a long time since my ex has been out of my life officially, or at least moved 2-3 hours away, yet, I'm still stuck on the past.
I still find myself having these sessions of talking to myself out loud trying to figure out my feelings. Why I am still on this stupid girl who ultimately picked another guy over me (I don't blame her), and why has it plagued me for such a long time.
My depression has gotten a lot worse over the years, even during the relationship,
and this whole ex-thing triggers the worst of it.
Because it can be used by my stupid brain to hurt me:
Why did she need to leave me? Why wasn't I not good enough? Was I not making her happy? How can I live with the experiences I had with her when she started talking to people? Am I insecure? Will I ever be normal again? Can I ever love again?
All these questions keep arising during my worst times and it's so constant that it drives me insane (amongst other stuff that my depressive episodes make me think about).

These past few months I cut contact with her, finally. We had been trying to be friends but I don't think I have enough closure in me right now to be a friend for her. No matter how bad I want her in my life.
And I have actually felt better. She stopped being a constant in my stream of thought. I have suppressed it all enough these past few months that it's not a problem.
But she showed back up in my dreams today and yesterday, right when I started to feel better these past few weeks.

Why can't I stop being obsessive. Am I a failure? Is this just who I am and will be? 
I just need some form of closure, or something that isn't the constant criticism I face from myself and others. My ex can't give it to me, no matter how much I want to text her and have her make it all make sense. 
So what can I do?",GrimblesTheClown,0,5,1.0
702,my boyfriend is extremely loving and caring but he‚Äôs a bit dumb.,11heof2,"I (19F) and my boyfriend (21M) have been dating for about 6 months now. He‚Äôs so loving, cares about me a lot, and cares about my family. We recently just moved in together and im starting to think it might have been a mistake. 

I know we‚Äôre both young, and still learning everyday. But sometimes i just feel like i have to teach him everything. some of the most basic concepts too. the last person i dated was very smart, so this was just a huge change to me. But i just figured ‚Äú i was the same way at some point and had to have someone explain these things to me too.‚Äù But as the time has passed it‚Äôs starting to get more and more frustrating.

I‚Äôve noticed he doesn‚Äôt think before he speaks, and that‚Äôs where our problems stem from. the other night we went out to dinner with his brother. his brother brought up the name jeremy, which just so happens to be my (very toxic) step brothers name whom i do not like. My bf knows this so he shot me a look and giggled. simple right? so i giggled back but then he went ‚Äú Yeah that‚Äôs real convenient right?‚Äù and his brother gets confused and looks at me. i felt very put on the spot, and i wasn‚Äôt wanting to sit and talk about my step brother who has given me alot of trauma. and i figured my boyfriend would know this. so i quickly just changed the topic. After we got home, i realized this isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs made me uncomfortable like this due to his lack of thinking ahead. when i tried to bring this up to me he just said ‚Äú he wanted to laugh‚Äù which is usually what he says. and on that same dinner he kept saying things that were super cringy and no one understood, not even his own brother. it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs trying to be funny but doing it too much.

I want to be able to have intelligent conversations with him. i want to feel like he‚Äôs taught me something. but so far that hasn‚Äôt been the case. i‚Äôve never been loved by someone like this. nor have i been with someone who‚Äôs so in love with my family. he just seems like he‚Äôs a bit immature and dumb. i hate saying things like that about him. but it‚Äôs true.

it‚Äôs not like i can tell him ‚Äú you‚Äôre unintelligent, can you please fix that?‚Äù i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anyway for me to properly bring this up. I want us to work, so do i just have to ignore these things?",Hungry-Stable-4891,2,2,0.67

Anyways. People ask for SO much from him. They wanna park their cars in there. They wanna use it to work on their cars. They want HIM to fix their cars in HIS garage for FREE. They think he enjoys working on cars because he's a ""car guy"". Let me tell you right now, no car guy actually enjoys working on cars lol. They enjoy having a cool car. But this is a constant thing. Its EVERYDAY people ask for so much from him. His cousin just called and said he's selling his car trailer and wants to know if my husband will lend him his car trailer every month so he can haul his racecar 30 minutes away. That's wear and tear. It's very expensive to maintain a car trailer. And knowing his cousin, he won't pay to have it fixed if something broke. And he won't pay for him to use it. And a lot of people want my husband to use his trailer to tow their SHIT cars to his garage and just let it fucking sit. We are both WAY TOO NICE and don't know how to say no. And I've been wanting to make a facebook post about it so I don't have to say it to a specific person but HOLY FUCK! ITS EVERY SINGLE DAY SOMEONE ASKS FOR SOMETHING! Someone will think we're talking only about them. At the same time i dont give a fuck because that means they will quit. But he's way nicer than I am and he'll probably tell me to take it down because he doesn't want people to be mad at him. Idk man. Its really draining helping people all the time.

I was born in early 2000s so I was around when phones, technology, etc were around but I just loved being active and my parents refused to buy me a phone until high school (honestly, I had no need for one). I won't lie - I was kinda mad about that because all my friends had phones. 

Now I see where they were coming from. I eat with someone: they go on their phone. People talk about having 9 hours of screen time: they're not kidding and at least half of it is spent playing games. 

FINE, it's THEIR life, not mine, but it's just sad when I see people always on their phones every waking second, even people I'm close to. They have so much more potential than to be a couch potato. 

I'm in classes with friends who ask for extensions on everything because they were on TikTok for five hours.

711,It's on the schools!,11hcdgq,"I'm sick and tired of seeing these tragic school shootings, and these tragic STABBINGS at school! People wanna point the finger trying to figure out who was the real victim and the real villains are in these situations, i'm pointing fingers at the PARENTS AND THE SCHOOL STAFF! 

Parents:

Y'all need to teach your kids that what you say to people MATTERS, what you do to people MATTERS! All that ""kids being kids"" bullshit needs to stop, when you enable this behavior you are telling your kid and the kids that they are potentially hurting that YOU DON'T CARE about their feelings or how they could be making others feel and that it's okay! 

Stop ignoring your children when they come home and tell you that they are being bullied, stop telling them that kids are just being kids, because those same kids end up going to middle school and high school  with your kid bullying them mercilessly and it just gets worse over the years! 

Those mean comments get worse, they turn into NASTY comments, and they turn into verbal and physical abuse and violent behavior and altercations! By the time you notice, it's already too late!

 Your kid is in the hospital because they tried to kill themselves or they were beaten up to the brink of death, they succeeded at killing themselves or they took the lives of their peers due to fear of going to school and dealing with the horrendous acts of violence everyday! 

Teach your kid that their words DO HURT! They don't hurt PHYSICALLY but they DO HURT MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY, and no people are just being sensitive, and no these aren't always just jokes. You don't know what other go through behind closed doors, you don't know how they feel all the time. People are different, that's what makes everyone unique in their own way, we have different interest, styles, lifestyles etc. you shouldn't be bullied for that! 

Start parenting at home, treat them to be good to others and being kind. If they don't vibe with them folks, alright. But LEAVE THEM PEOPLE ALONE!

&#x200B;

School staff:

How many of y'all are reporting these incidents that you see, how many of y'all are getting involved before it gets to this point? You're right... you don't get paid enough to break up these fights, and risk getting hurt to stop them but YOU NEED TO DO YOUR BEST TO PREVENT THEM! 

What are you doing to prevent these from escalating further, because as someone who was bullied me AND MY SIBLINGS AND PARENTS REPORTED it and nothing was done until I started fighting back, I got in trouble for fighting back of course, they knew what I was going through did nothing to stop and when I finally got fed up and beat on someone... I was the bad guy! 

Do you know how much suffering and crying I had to go through before I finally snapped. I dealt with that for 6 years, before I finally decided enough was enough and started fighting back. I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, being tormented and physically beat up by a bunch of BOYS! 

All of the teachers knew and did nothing to stop it or even to help, it was just ""boys being boys"" that's all they told my mom, that's all they told me. A lot of this could have been avoided had someone actually stepped in sooner. 

Nowadays, you guys don't even report what goes on, you just see it and dismiss it. These parents don't know why their kid comes home miserable, they don't know why their kid is depressed, don't know why their kid is in the hospital for trying to take their own life or took their own life, they don't know why their kid took the lives of other students and faculty. They know nothing, because you won't tell them anything. 

&#x200B;

Parents and Schools need to do better because these kids, these issues, these reactions, they are staring you in the face and you are blatantly ignoring them, and wonder why your kid is about to do life in prison at 16, why your kid took their own life or tried to take their own life, why this kid brought a knife to school, why is this kid is constantly fighting, why is this kid such a menace!

713,Coworker problems...,11h9e0e,"So I (23F) have a coworker (late 40s F) who used to be one of my ""work friends"" here at my job. We'll call her Jenna. Never hung out outside of work, sent each other memes now and again, pretty basic level of friendship. That all started to change when she decided to completely stonewall me. The first time she did it, I asked her if I did something to upset her. She told me I ""looked too stressed."" Which I thought was a stupid reason to get mad at me, especially considering I have an anxiety disorder and she knows that, but I let it go and we made peace.

Cut to about three weeks ago, this is now the third time she's decided to stonewall me for no apparent reason. Because of that, I decided that she is no longer worth my time and energy, so I'm not going to ask her what I ""did wrong."" It makes work a little awkward, but I have other work friends, and I've been spending my workdays talking with them and concentrating on my job. I don't talk to Jenna unless it's work-related, and other than glaring at me once for asking a work-related question, she does the same.

Here's where the new problem comes in. Our team is very small, 9 people total and there's only one day a week when all 9 of us are present. Jenna and I share the same work friends, but there's a few team members she doesn't talk to because she doesn't like them. I've started chatting more with those team members, I don't have any grievances with them and it's been nice to have new people to talk to. Well, a couple days ago, I noticed Jenna is now talking to and making friends with those teammates she supposedly doesn't like. I feel like it's only a matter of time before she gains their trust and then makes them all ignore me too or something along that line that I won't be able to report to HR because there's no evidence of a ""hostile workplace"" or whatever.

For more context: Jenna is very charismatic and considered ""popular"" at my company. She has a decent amount of work friends in other departments, our supervisor included. I'm the newest member of our team, but not that new; I've been here almost 8 months, Jenna's been here exactly 1 year. I can almost guarantee that the mutual work friends we have (who are all around the same age as me, not sure if that matters) would choose Jenna over me. She's outspoken, she'll do favors for the people she likes, she acts like people's ""work mom,"" and it's awkward and ugly to get on her bad side. It's beneficial to be her friend, which is what assures to me that when it comes down to Jenna vs me, everyone would go team Jenna.

I'm just here trying to do my job. I'm on the autism spectrum and socialization is hard enough for me as it is, plus I have other mental health issues, so I try my best. I'm overqualified for my position (I work in a lab and my current position does not require a degree, but I have one). The only reason why I'm not in a higher department is because there are no openings, otherwise I would absolutely be working there instead. I'm patiently waiting for a position to open up and looking for outside places that will require a degree and pay me more, but finding a job isn't easy. Other than the issues with Jenna, I enjoy what I do and at least it's in my field and giving me lab experience (I started this job two months after finishing college and hadn't worked in a lab prior). I wish I could do this at a more advanced level because I know I'm capable of it, but I'm kinda stuck here for now.

I'm hoping none of this makes me sound like a bitch. I never wanted drama. I have very few friends outside of work and essentially no female friends, so I was so happy when there were women at my job who liked me. I'm just so tired of it all. I have to keep telling myself that there's nothing wrong with me, but anybody who's ever struggled with self-esteem can understand that it's not easy to convince yourself of that all the time. Not to mention my socialization issues, I feel like I'm constantly doing mental gymnastics trying to figure out what I should do or say in any situation. I try not to let it get to me, but it's exhausting and frustrating.

My wife father recently passed away and her sister and family came to town and was saying with us, they have two boys 14 and 17 and they both have some form of mental health issues, but they are both very lazy and don‚Äôt help do anything around the house and completely rely on their mom to cook, clean, do there laundry and basically everything else in their life, the father is a retired army vet and doesn‚Äôt get involved in raising them do to PTSD issues, but when there grandpa died the oldest son was having the hardest time dealing with it and i over heard that for the past two years they have allowed him to get his own vap pen and let him smoke THC oil to ‚Äúhelp him deal‚Äù and he was basically high the entire two weeks they stayed with us, and to me it just seems wrong to start using medical cannabis to help cope with mental health at such a young age especially since it was not proscribed by a doctor, the parents smoke and I guess they think it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best but to me it‚Äôs kinda like just drinking to cope with emotional stress/ pain, it‚Äôs all just make me feel good and not actually getting your emotions out and talking about it, but like I said that‚Äôs just my opinion, I‚Äôm no therapist or anything i didn‚Äôt say anything except to my wife and all I said was ‚Äúso they are just letting him be high all the time?‚Äù And all she said was ‚ÄúI guess so, they let him take a shot of Jack Daniels last night too‚Äù",ApexAG88,9,1,0.67

726,Stressed out because my parents got stressed out at the idea of me (18 year old male) being gay. I haven't even come out yet but they are already suggesting disowning me when I'm able to live on my own.,11h14hd,"So I've always wanted to be a girl since I was tiny, I already looked feminine back then and liked it when people mistook me as one. But the entirety of my relatives are homophobes, I'll talk about my parents specifically.

I haven't come out of the closet yet but just the idea of me being gay or just being girly in general has made both my parents so stressed out. I went on a week long school trip (a study tour) from Myanmar to Thailand where I wore a skirt, partly because I really wanted to crossdress and feel feminine like I always have and passed it on as a joke, which just put my parents into fucking despair. They said they couldn't sleep at night at the thought that I had been influenced by the Lady Boy stuff in Thailand. That was a couple weeks ago, this morning we were sitting in the living room and I just wanted to bring up a topic to talk about, and the topic I chose unfortunately was what did they think about transgender people and why were they so against it.

I wasn't trying to come out, I just wanted to know why they hated anything that ain't straight, but then they took it as ""oh no, our son is testing the waters again so he can admit that he's gay"" or some shit. Conversation went by, my parents have been stressed out over it for the whole day. My mother told me how depressed my father has been over it so I went upstairs to just give a white lie, ""I'm not gay, I'm not interested in being a girl, blah blah blah.""

So the talk devolved into a suggestion of disowning me. My father said that if I were to be gay he would continue to support me financially until he thinks I'm ready to live on my own, where he will cut ties with me completely so that I can be as gay as I want without disgracing the rest of the family. Hell, he brought up an uncle I never got to meet that was a movie star, they want to be proud of having an actor in the family but couldn't just because he's gay.

Now I'm alone in my room again, they trust that I'm a straight and masculine son that they can be proud of. They take a lot of pride in me being male. I'm given the option of coming out and being disowned by all my relatives OR continue as I have and never mention or act upon my desire to cross dress.

I love my family, they are great people if you meet them. The biggest flaws on them are that they are racist homophobes. They're improving on their racism so that's something. Anyways, I really do love them and want to spend my life with them, so I'm just going to keep my shit hidden and stay on their standards. I'm kinda depressed about having to have made the choice but I've made peace with the idea. I'll just have to bite the bullet.

&#x200B;

TL;DR : Just the idea of me being gay made my father depressed without me having to come out about it. If I came out I'll get disowned as soon as they trust me to live on my own. I love my family despite them being homophobes so I'll just not come out ever.",HorrorCriticism3433,5,7,1.0

Where do I begin? 
I'm 25. I've supported my family since I was 12. 
I was a single child at first subjected to greater privileges and many displeasures. I practically raised myself when it came to learning how to operate in the world and generally care for myself. I heard and saw things I shouldn't have and I just sat back and observed. 
Fast toward 4 years I now have two sisters who I care for, to my parents I was the personal maid, babysitter, and caregiver, you name it, for the past 12 years. 
Now at the ripe age of 25, I don't have that responsibility to care for my sisters, but no one is stepping up.
At this time our parents are now divorced because you guessed it stepdad was a piece of shit. 
And our mother has no sense of independence, and she is extremely co-dependent 
And it makes me angry, angry to the point where I would say I hate my family.

742,I bought a slice of fancy durian crepe cake for my birthday.,11gmq0u," A strong smell but awesome flavor,T If you don‚Äôt know, The Durian is a legendary fruit enjoyed mostly in Southeast Asia.  Similar to jackfruit in appearance, it has the unique reputation of being one of the most intense-smelling fruits in existence, with confusingly different reviews by consumers.  Almost all who eat the custard-like fruit will describe it in colorful and often opposing terms.  Some will say it has a mildly sweet flavor, reminiscent of almonds or a very mild banana.  Others however, revoltingly describe it as tasting like sweaty gym socks, or onions, or armpit, or a mix of all three with a smattering of wet dog/garbage.  There is no in-between.  It‚Äôs either delicious or disgusting. 

I first heard of durian in an article, and was instantly intrigued.  I looked it up, and fell down the rabbit hole of reviews, videos, articles and travel blogs all related to eating durian.  I found it fascinating seeing how some people seemed genetically predisposed to genuinely enjoy it while others absolutely hated it.  Truly there is no in-between.  I even saw one video of two American guys tasting it, and where one guy smiled and said it tasted amazing, the other guy vomited all over his own lap.  

I had to try it.  

However, I live in the upper Midwest of the USA, and there is absolutely no durian here.  The closest you‚Äôll get is a durian-flavored dessert of drink of some sort, and that‚Äôs only held in specialty food shops in very large cities where substantial populations of Southeast Asian immigrants/students reside and study.  I‚Äôve lived in college towns my whole life and have never seen a store that serves it.  

Until! 

I discovers a nice little Japanese sweets shop in downtown Minneapolis next to the UVM.  The entire four-block radius the shop is located in is awash in Korean/Japanese bistros and fast-food eatery‚Äôs a few clicks away from the main campus, so it‚Äôs a busy busy area very popular with the students, especially international students who want a taste of home.  When I went into the sunbathed doors the first time, several happy students and professors were gathered around couches and tables sharing slices of crepe cake, munching on Mochi, and sipping sweet boba teas like something out of Ouran High School Host Club.  It was beautiful.  I ordered matcha-flavored cake and tea, and was so impressed with the texture and mildly sweet flavor of the cake that I decided that this was going to be my new favorite sweets shop.  

I decided to return today on a whim because I wanted to pre-celebrate my birthday tomorrow because bitch I‚Äôm worth it.  I ordered online and that‚Äôs when I saw it: 

Durian Crepe Cake Slice.  $9.25.  

My eyes popped when I read it, and my delighted heart started to jump for joy as my internal monologue reacted the same way you would react if you suddenly saw a celebrity in your local coffee shop.  Durian?  HERE??  In Minnesota??  For nine bucks!!!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MEEEEEE

I carried home a boba tea, and packed two cake slices (one matcha, one durian) into my lunch bag.  When I got home and sat down, I did a little grateful prayer in my heart for this amazing opportunity to finally sample the fruit flavor that I‚Äôve long-been curious about, and unzipped the bag.  

There‚Äôs a scene in the 1993 classic Grumpy Old Men, where Jack Lemmons fisherman character John Gustafson pulls a memorable prank on his long-time nemesis and neighbor Max Goldman in a moment of pure pettiness.  When Maxs‚Äô back was turned, John took a freshly-caught fish and tossed it into the back window of Maxs‚Äô filthy truck, knowing Max wouldn‚Äôt ever look back there.  There it rotted for a good portion of the movie, until Max suddenly smelled it one day and made such an iconically repulsed face that it made the movie suddenly memorable.  The entire scene of him digging through his truck screaming and retching and cursing went down in my opinion as one of the highlights of 1993 general film culture.  

The smell that assaulted my nose was so strong, so horrid that I immediately backed up and stopped breathing.  My eyes watered.  My tongue dried up.  I half-blinked rapidly while staring at a spot on my wall, just trying to recover from the initial shock.  

Durian smells NOTHING LIKE like mildly sweet almond custard.  

DURIAN SMELLS LIKE SHIT.  

Like an onion that molded and half-rotted in the back of your cupboard for three months.  Or old gym socks worn under a football players armpits for a whole day.  Or old unwashed underwear sweat during your period.  Or your grandpas airy farts after eating eggs and onion soup.  Like DAMN.  Durian stinks.  Durian STINKS.

Once you do a backdash you can cancel it before the complete full animation is complete, but you CAN'T cancel it into another backdash, so to circumvent this players found out that you can just crouch to cancel the animation and backdash again.

People call it a ""tech"" but the fact is that it's an exploit. Regardless if it's beneficial or not, it's by definition an exploit of the mechanics of the game (this originated before the 2000s so no surprise developers overlooked stuff like this in all sorts of games). Still, it proved to have good reception from the players. 

Emergent gameplay isn't limited to exploiting mechanics, it can be just using the mechanics of the game on a bigger scheme, like luring a nearby predator to a base in Farcry and making it take out some enemies for you... not much on a exploit but rather just a good strategy overall, since animals have all sorts of ways to interact with NPCs and sometimes it's even intended (like when a predator is caged within a base and you shoot the lock to free them, this is clearly a defined path, it's optional the way is clear). 
Glitches aren't necessarily part of emergent gameplay. 

With that said, a valid criticism that emergent gameplay from exploits have is that it's not part of the environment of a game.

The korean backdash totally changed how the game played out, many moves became safe on whiff and kick attacks of most characters became garbage tier (they fixed those things in subsequent games anyway)

Meaning, the Korean backstep was something that didn't interact with the other elements of the game as the other elements themselves did between them.
It's no different than discovering the ancient ballista ""behind the shield"" Marauder cheese. It shows this was clearly not inside the game design because this was nerfed heavily.

Some people argue with basketball: When basketball was invented there was (and is) a rule that you can't run with the ball...

What's a good way to go around this limitation? That's right, passing the ball to yourself repeatedly. How? Bounce it on the floor. And that's dribbling for you.

-The catch is that new rules needed to be made so that dribbling became also part of the system of interaction that the rules within basketball had. In other words, adjust it so that it interacts the same way passing does with holding the ball.

The rules, which stand today:

""A player who is dribbling may not put any part of his hand under the ball and (1) carry it from one point to another or (2) bring it to a pause and then continue to dribble again. A pass or fumble which touches his backboard, basket ring or is touched by another player. PENALTY: Loss of ball""

-From the NBA website.

Are there emergent rules to make the Korean backdash adjust? No... i mean, no. Technically buffing other stuff did sort of fix the balance issues, but the lack of limitations on the K backdash are still there even if it doesn't affect the players directly. If a robot did the inputs on a inhuman levels of speed it would shine to light how broken it actually is (it's not like AI hacks and macros already exist but whatever.)
And so, the Korean backdash has a place in the game, yes, but it's limitations aren't clear in comparison to other rest of Tekken's mechanics. 

Even combos are emergent gameplay, in Street Fighter 2 people discovered that you could string many moves together, it was broken back then but now we have games that have a whole set of mechanics (rules) that put limits on such system. Like having a stun bar or just a complex stunlock mechanic (GG Strive just to an example). 


2- (Doom Eternal as an example of a systemic game)- Now let's talk about Doom Eternal :


Doom Eternal is the example of a game with great systemic gameplay.

Everything interacts with everything accordingly, in harmony. 
*There's no way around it.*

The closest thing to emergent gameplay was the ballista splash damage cheese for the Marauder... and it was heavily nerfed. 
BHopping is there... mostly useful in speedruns though, in combat it's just not even conventional, it's straight decorative. 

Currently the most emergent gameplay in Doom Eternal that I can think of is... Marauder rocket cheese.

One could argue that weapon combos are emergent gameplay but... that's more of ""strategic emergence"", if that makes sense, those are more accurately 'microtactics' that help measure enemy health in relation to gun damage. Just like chess has positions that are the best to take.

-Even with all those possible examples of emergent gameplay in Doom Eternal, people who play at high level know that Doom Eternal simply has a systemic game loop. Stuff interacts with each other as it is, without is and buts. No gaps in the rules. No going around rules.
 
The player uses the mechanics of the game with accordance to the interaction it has with the rest of the elements of the game: Glory kills give you health, and so learning when to do a glory kill is an advantage.

Having clever ways to use glory kills (like using it to take a breather) is cool, but not emergent gameplay, because that's how the mechanic of glory kill interacts with the demons regardless of your actions... you gain iframes whether you like it or not. 
Once you start a glory kill animation, you will gain iframes and you can't circumvent this. 

The point is, Doom Eternal has a systemic combat, but it feels like it's emergent because how many paths the mechanics themselves open up... although the restrictive aspect of the high difficulty gives Doom Eternal the edge. Increasing your effectiveness with ONLY the mechanics the game offers you is a universal aspect of difficulty in videogames, restriction itself implies difficulty to most players. Regardless, it's systemic. 

-Not having freedom and having to succeed with only the card you were handed (the mechanics and the freedom/limitations of them). 

Sekiro as an example: That game is nigh-uncheese-able. 
The game actively tells you to *learn how to deal with enemies with the mechanics you have*, your main mechanics are blocking/deflecting, dodging/dashing, spirit emblems (meaning skills and prosthetic skills) and counters (mikiri counter, jumping counter, lightning reversal). 

In Sekiro you can't go around these, because you need them (and consequently learn to use them) to succeed.
Bosses will test your mastery of each of these mechanics. Just like UN, Master Levels or Horde Mode test your mastery over the mechanics. In Sekiro/Doom Eternal, you don't discover new mechanics, you simply don't... and it works. 
The game gives you the hand, and you play it. 
There's no ""cancel this animation with a jump to~"" NO, you just play your hand. Use the mechanics. You have to solve a puzzle, there might be many ways to solve a puzzle, but the tools you have to solve the puzzle are the same... as well as the sl
solutions having the same foundation. 

Dash, quick swap, chainsaw, glory kill, blood punch, flamethrower, crucible/hammer, etc. 

3- (a bunch of examples of the influence of emergent gameplay in videogames)- See, the current demand in gaming is about emergent gameplay. 

Sandboxes with ""loose"" mechanics (mechanics with a lot of leniant quality of life characteristics, like lots of frames to cancel an animation) the opposite of ""Ubisoft tailored game"" (which Ubi games actually a lot of emergent gameplay but whatever).

Funny enough, Deus Ex (great games) still not mainstream despite being VERY abundant with emergent gameplay, probably because the game is kind of systemic if you think of it as ""the mechanics of Deus Ex are there specifically to be emergent gameplay"". Deus Ex MD kinda scratched the surface, still not that crazy, despite how insanely good that game is.

A microscopic example of this in the ""great games"" category is God of War 2018, most animations of attack can be cancelled even in *the first frame* of the animations with a dodge or block. This actually lead to a serious cheese exploit of forward dash punch spamming but fortunately is kinda obscure despite being so easy to do. GOWR fixed most if not all of those op attacks btw. 

Of course, some attacks can't be cancelled midway (slow, big, high damage attacks and some specific attacks) but the game still has that element of 'looseness'. 
The reason for the term 'loose' it's because the action snaps easily from the connection it has to other mechanics, in this case the ability to cancel animations easily leads to the mechanic of attacking being loose to the aspect of risk/reward in the game, it's purpose is not clearly defined, why have heavy attacks when you have light attacks that can be cancelled?

 Obviously GOW's combat isn't so shallow, I am purposefully skipping elements like enemy types, hyperarmor, spacing, and other things just to illustrate my point. Even while skipping those elements, some games don't have such saving mechanics to complement their combat and actually suffer from that.
Like COD MW2019 with the broken slide canceling.

- Doom Eternal is one of the few games where systemic combat is different from the standard of combat despite the obsession with emergent gameplay from the population. 
People are tired of having to adjust from one game's mechanics to another... so, game developers know this and make mechanics very loose, mechanics that work on a vacuum really well, and with questionable effects on the whole structure of a game element.

Pre-2016 games usually don't lack that 'restrictive aspect'. Even Uncharted 4 is relatively very systemic compared to recent games... a game that was considered to have crazy emergent gameplay on it's era lol. Alien Isolation, *Amnesia*, Outlast, Resident Evil and many more games are now considered systemic, when in the past were the ones with quite the emergent gameplay.

I have to mention Ultrakill here, Ultrakill is, to an extent, opposite of Doom Eternal, in Ultrakill you can make stuff work and it works, it's more freedom than restriction. You can abuse the coin but... where's the fun in that? 

If you ask the same question in Doom Eternal it would be ""You can just abuse the super shotgun, but where's the mastery in that?"" 

- Ultrakill lets loose, Doom Eternal requires. 


4- (conclusion and clarification)- I'm not saying those mechanics are bad, just setting the differences. Again, those mechanics are fine and I love the combat in GOW and Ultrakill, and whatever game I mentioned. I'm simply, and just simply, pointing out the differences. (God I'm going to get attacked by those points lol).

- Back to Doom Eternal, most systemic games are ""revolver games"", games that revolves around it's rules, it's own mechanics, it's own strong foundations. Which is one of the reasons Doom Eternal has such a great systemic combat and will probably remain niche despite it's initial acclaim on release. It stands out from the games that 'made it' because of that reason. ""With little you do a lot"" or however that saying goes.

Systemic games usually if not always lead to the guidance of mastery of the game as opposed to most games with a lot of emergent gameplay. Doom Eternal wants you to master it's mechanics to fully explore what the game has for you to enjoy, for example. Having too much emergent gameplay would mean that the game isn't about mastering dash, quick swapping or glory kills all in harmony, but rather use these mechanics in a vacuum to essentially go around the puzzles that are the combat arenas. Obviously every game has a scale of mastery in them, but systemic games are *about* it on their foundation.

And Doom Eternal isn't the only game that's like this, Sekiro, Ghostrunner and Hollow Knight come to mind, but it's certainly not a thing in the industry anymore. 

-Then again, emergent gameplay isn't wrong, it's actually really good and leads to insanely great games like BOTW, that game *is about* emergent gameplay, but we have to acknowledge that we need systemic games too. 

(I used Doom Eternal as an example for systemic gameplay, but I'm pretty sure there are other games out there, and since the discussion of Doom Eternal's combat has been known for a while now, I figured I'd have a well documented topic as a foundation for my point).

-But we have to acknowledge that systemic games are important, without them there wouldn't be emergent gameplay to begin with. And systemic games are a good way to design games with mastery of the mechanics as the ultimate objective of the games. Regardless if it's multiplayer or not.",WeebSlayer27,2,1,1.0

752,I was broken up with even though I'm perfect for him. I'm kind of angry about it.,11g8dp4,"We were compatible in so many ways. 

- both didn't want kids

- both heavily left leaning. Both slightly anti woke but far socially and economically left. 

- both atheists. Specifically we were both agnostic atheists. 

- we were both philosophy majors who majored in the same subspecialty. We literally talked for hours a day about philosophy or current events or politics. The conversation was substantial. 

- let me just emphasis the philosophy point. We essentially shared a brain. Finished each other's sentences, came to the same conclusions, sometimes for different but similar reasons. I often felt like I was speaking to another version of myself who was simply more articulate. We were huge philosophy dorks together. We showed each other need things. We debated often about the finer points but happily agreed our differences were minor and still fun to discuss. 

And then there are the ways where we were opposite. 

- he had an anxious personality and I'm very calm. He said he felt more relaxed around me. 

- in bed, he was dominant and I was submissive. Amazing match. When we were talking about sex and what we wanted to try, we were finishing each other's sentences. 

- my career requires that I be on site. His career allows work from home. He prefers having a partner who doesn't work from home so he can spend the day to himself, do small chores, and get in alone time. While it's not a deal breaker for me, I low key want someone who works from home, that way if we get a dog someone can take care of it's basic needs. 

And then, did we mesh together well? Yeah. He showed me movies. We tried different foods. The conversation was just as good in person. The chemistry translated. He started opening up about his mental health with me when we became more serious. Once that happened, he was comfortable with me and far more chatty when he saw I accepted him for who he was. We were both very touchy people, and loved giving and and getting massages. That was great. 

Yesterday he tried to get together. He texted that ""we need to talk"" via text and asked me to grab a drink with him. 

I asked if we were okay and he said no. I told him that if it was over, I'd prefer to just have a phone call instead of meet up. He said okay, he called me later in the evening. 

So why did he break up with me? 

I'm too young. I'm 29 and he's 41. 

When we first started dating I asked him about that, about how that made him feel. He said he hasn't dated anyone that young in a while, it wasn't his goal, but he was fine with it if I'm fine with it. I was. We never talked about it again, we just focused on all the great parts. 


So I think that reason was bullshit. 

He told me that I was too young and that at this point he knew he didn't see us working long term. I just said okay, that makes sense *(it didn't, but what the fuck else am I supposed to say?? I'm not going to debate someone into staying with me).*  He said it was painful to do it because he was sure he'd never find the same kind of intellectual connection with someone. He was open to being friends and meant it. He said early on in dating he was glad to know I didn't keep in touch with exes, but now that knowledge pained him, but he still had to be honest. I confirmed, I don't keep in touch with people, it's easier for me to move on. 

He tried to pay me back for some things and I said it was easier for me to forget about it. He pressed, I switched the subject and asked if there was anything else he needed to say. Then we disconnected. 

I blocked him immediately for my own peace of mind. 

I didn't like our age gap at first. I got used to it because everything else was fantastic. 

I think he's lying. I think he's using it as an excuse for something else. Maybe I look like too much of a troll in the mornings. Maybe I'm too short. Maybe I'm too playful and he's too serious... I thought he liked that. 

The day day we last saw each other, we were watching a comedy sketch on his TV and I was dying laughing. He is not a person who smiles or laughs often. While I was enjoying the show and laughing my but off, in my peripheral vision I saw him staring at me and smiling. When my laughter subsided, he pulled me into his arms and kissed my forehead. Still smiling. 

Before I left his place, he gave me his sweater and a USB stick with a few movies and TV shows he torrented for me that I expressed an interest in watching. 

When I got home he asked about how I liked a movie we had just watched. He liked knowing my opinions on movies, because it could help him tailor a better suggestion for next time. 

Later that day he tells me his mom has gone on an alcoholic bender and he's not doing well mentally. We talk a bit. He says he needs space. I give him space for several days, with the occasional text saying I hope he's okay and I'm there if he wants or needs it. 

Next text I get is the text asking to get together so he can break up with me (was nicer than that). 


So yeah. I'm angry. I think he blew something up that way really damn good. I'm sorry his mom is going through something... I think that's what sparked this. But I'm not going to fight to keep him. If he's telling me it's over, whatever.",Constantlydeleted,0,3,0.8

And i know youre all probably like wym?
So my friend likes me in a way of wanting to date me and ever since she came to visit me last year whenever me and my boyfriend  first started dating, we had a threeway, no real intercourse just touching each other ect. And then she came back again and apparently my boyfriend has been hiding that he wants a three-way relationship with her and me cuz its something hes always wanted but he wanted someone else he can trust and that he found attractive. He claims he likes me first and that he loves me more ect and that he would be fine that i dont want to but he would need days to get over it. But here is the reason im here but let me cook.

So we ended up having more threesomes and my bestfriend would say she regrets it after and i dont necessarily like threeways but i do im very indesisive. Id have to basically trust them and know they wouldnt catch feelings ect and do stuff without talking to me or being present right?

Well thats the exact opposite of what happened. I know i may be overreacting but they kissed. While i was at work bussing my fucking ass! I was working hard, ive been more responsible and have proven to him that i can help more with bills ect. And before yall say anything, im just ranting so i just want people to listen. My boyfriend thinks its just a kiss and he admits that it was wrong and that he is being selfish because he wants to date me and my bestfriend. Like wtf. Am i not enough? I even resorted to cutting myself for the first time ever in my entire life and i never thought someone would, even push me to this point. It just sucks ass that i have to go through this.

He thinks that kissing my bestfriend isnt an issue and i feel like its my fault because i said it was okay for us to keep having threeways. But it was supposed to be a threeway consentual thing. We were all supposed to agree to everything and do everything together. And then the thing is my bestfriend set boundaries the night before it happened and i left them at home while i worked trusting them and i come home to find out i cant. I swear all men are the same. 

I just dont feel like i am wanted and i feel worthless. He says he loves me and that he will get over it. But why do you want someone else so strongly it makes me feel like you dont truly want me. 

I wish i could believe him but i cant . I dont think he truly loves me but alot of his actions say otherwise. He does love me but he wants my bestfriend. I told him i wanted a theeeway relationship as wel too but before they went behind my back and did this it makes me not want to at all. I shouldnt have to share or compete for my boyfriend.i even envy my bestfriend shes better than me in all ways. BUT I DONT WANT TO SHARE ANYONE IM WITH. and yeah dont get me wrong a threeway relationship would be fun but i am the jealous type and i dont want my man fuckint someone else.

760,"The term ""sexualized"" is overused and annoying.",11g51aj,"Most adult humans are sexual beings and will therefore have certain people/things about them that they look at in a sexual way. It's natural. Yet often, you'll hear ""stop sexualizing X"" or ""omg I can't believe this has become so sexualized"" about things that are...yep...you guessed it, sexual. Before the angry comments start, let me say that nothing about your body or what you are or aren't wearing ever gives someone the right to harass you, treat you disrespectfully, or touch you without consent - ever. What I am talking about here are things that are sometimes *looked at* in a sexual way and may be associated with sexual *feelings*.

""Sexualize"" implies that you are *making something sexual* that is really *not normal to be sexual*. I.e. if I'm having a perfectly normal, work-related, G-rated conversation and someone throws in a ""That's what she said"" at a time that makes no sense, *then* I would say ""This person sexualized that"". But if I'm having a private conversation with a friend about someone I'm interested in, they think this person is a bad fit for me and they say ""Stop sexualizing them""? That just makes no sense. I am literally sexually attracted to them, I didn't *make* them sexual, I just *see* the sexual side of them because that's just naturally how I feel.

My absolute favorite, is the idea that breasts are ""sexualized"". Like I get where you're coming from, yes technically men have nipples, a chest is a chest and sometimes men store fat there too, so why is one type of ""breast"" looked at different than another, etc., and I'm not claiming to have a perfect explanation for that, but it's just how it is. Sure the media could have made this stronger, but people like boobs. Even a straight woman can appreciate them. There are biological reasons in there too. People didn't *make the decision to be turned on by them*, they just *are*. You could say their purpose is to feed babies, sure that's one function, but many women never want to have kids, or have kids but do not breastfeed. Some people just think of them as sexy. Deal with it. Saying that the sole purpose of them is to feed babies makes you sound like a catholic school teacher who says that sex should only be for procreation and you should not enjoy it.

Tldr, no one has the right to be a creep, but stop claiming that everything is ""sexualized"" when it's just people seeing the sexual side of something or someone that already exists. Nothing wrong with being ace, but for most of the population it's like the Backstreet Boys said, ""Am I sexual?"" ""Yeahhh"", not ""Am I sexual?""

How those women see him as nothing more than a cash grab? Is that what y‚Äôall want? Women like me flooded the comments. You need a decent personality, you need to be confident to a certain extent. You need to be overall nice. Not just to her but to other people too. Say you open doors for not only your lady, but old ladies too. That‚Äôs attractive. Being respectful of her and others and even yourself is attractive. Cleaning your face and using chapstick isn‚Äôt a bad thing, and it doesn‚Äôt magically turn you gay. Nobody want to kiss mister 80 grit sandpaper lips. That‚Äôs really it. You don‚Äôt need to be super attractive. JUST BE A NICE PERSON. And if that‚Äôs too hard to accomplish, seek mental help. Being a nice person, being respectful, being confident ARE PERSONALITY TRAITS. Yes all you need as a good well rounded personality. And maybe a dash of patience. It‚Äôs just the many traits in the personality that make you attractive. All my friends would tell you my man is average looking, boring even. But the way he treats me is everything I could‚Äôve asked for. I personally don‚Äôt care for expensive gifts, many girls don‚Äôt. Just pick her some flowers you find, (I have a collection of all the flowers he found and bought me dried up, and I plan to use them as confetti at our wedding ü•∞ my corsage will be dried and framed along with his boutonni√®re) if she likes crystals and rocks then give her a shiny rock you find. Or just buy her a couple crystals at a local metaphysical shop. They‚Äôre pretty cheap. You don‚Äôt need money. It‚Äôs the thought that counts. ‚ÄúI saw this and thought of you‚Äù is one of the sweetest little things that goes A LONG LONG WAY. When he does have the money he actually wants to spend his money on me, and wants to spoil me when he can. The random smothers in cuddles, it‚Äôs the little things guys. It really is just that. There‚Äôs a good song called more than words that conveys what I‚Äôm about to say. You can‚Äôt just say I love you and expect your point to come across your actions need to match. Show your love don‚Äôt just say it. If you have the imagination for it, imagine being a girl and you show up to try and get her. If you think it‚Äôs cringey and uncomfortable, you‚Äôre probably cringy and uncomfortable to be around and that‚Äôs why nobody likes you. Especially to those who have been friends zoned because most times women friendzone because they‚Äôre afraid of what you‚Äôll do if they say no. Because they likely think you‚Äôre creepy and know you‚Äôre just tryna be a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù just to get in her pants. Look at yourself. Ya nasty. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk. Edit: this is just a rant. I‚Äôm not here to therapy yall. Like I said talk to yo mama. Don‚Äôt have one? Your friends suck maybe? Get therapy. It‚Äôs all personal. It really is. It‚Äôs discovering yourself, it‚Äôs all sorts of shit. I don‚Äôt know nearly enough about each of you to tell y‚Äôall what to do individually. What I‚Äôm saying is it‚Äôs a start.

765,Looking at a person makes me tired,11fxwde,"      My dad recently got remarried. His wife,has a daughter that lives with them she is 25? 'Seasons' her food , but this involves dumping copious amounts of salt on the food. As result she has gained quite a bit of weight. Now I have known peopke that were her size before. None of them have been this disgusting. She is so gross that when she sits on the toilet there is always a stain. I cant tell you how many times I have wiped her monthly off of the seat. She decides to add to the problem by, not simply wiping it up. But instead by getting offended because she thinks its a personal attack on her. Thats my thesis here. 
        Her day to day routine consists of waking up around 11 am, doing the same laundry for 6th time in the week ( not kidding when I stayed with them this was a daily cycle, it is strictly her husband and hers that she is doing.) Turning on her gaming console with the surround sound as loud as possible and not doing anything until its time to cook dinner.( She has explicitly stated she volunteered for the duty.) After that she continues with the gaming until approximately 4 am. Her husband has a full time job, for extra context. She is unemployed and not in school.
          There have been several,times when her mother has asked about something miniscule and she has flown into a rage. Once when they got charged extra on the water bill because of a meter placed in the driveway.(getting ran over everyday will fuck you up)when stepsissy was told about the extra charge, but not why , on the phone by her mother, she flew into  some kind of panic and started screaming about "" I dont know what I'm going to do!"" , and "" I'm doing laundry and going to take a shower and I just don't know what I'm going to do"". Ironicly, none of those things you are currently doing could  affect a bill that is being charged for past usage. 
             Also I'm finding it hard to understand why, everything is a personal attack. For instance, when my elderly father called me to ask me to give him a ride because you told him in 30 minutes, and it had been 50 when he called  and I told him yes. Showed up at the house and she begins with her questions. "" Did you volunteer for this, or did he call you ? "" . Bitch its my father, what does it matter you were too busy playing your fuck fuck games. I can recall another instance, I watched her wash like 2 plates at the sink and then complain about feeling like Cinderella. She then promptly proceeded to ask me if I did cocaine, because I sniffle alot. 
              She not only has a bitch additude, but also lost her child to the baby's father,not once but twice. What makes this even sadder, is that her mother had custody of the child the second time and was taking complete care of him while stepsister was LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE. Stepsissy failed a cps drug test for coke and then the child was ripped from his grandmother's arms and taken to the father, somewhere in the swamplands in my state. I can also recall her asking me(after the child,was gone) "" how much does it take to fill that car up?""(she was gifted an old car of mine.) She was asking this so that she could figure out if she could use her mother's gas credit card to buy Newports with, saying something about knowing how to manipulate her. Not to mention I once saw her grab her child's arm and nearly yank it out of the socket because he didnt give her a kiss. 
             Sorry if this has been a frustrating read, its getting late and I also didnt intend to write an essay about my dislike for my stepstister. Anyway, she walks(stomps around ) all day just huffing and puffing, as if heaving yourself around a 60 yard area(at max) and just plopping tf down to take a break before you dye your hair for 3rd time this month was an exhillirating adventure. She acts constantly exhausted and I get exhausted looking at her. I stg if anyone actually read all this word for word I'll give you head and a sandwich.

The way people justify the deaths of all these people, especially the children, with false statistics, inaccurate history, and downright immoral beliefs, it makes me sick to my stomach. I would never advocate for an outright ban (partly because it would be impossible), but the fact so many people would be brandishing their easily obtained firearms just as the thought of basic gun control like required written, shooting, and psychological tests.

Had scans done following the treatment, and there was a suspicious looking lymph node that was swollen.

Had a biopsy done and turns out that the lymph node is positive for melanoma cells. This means that essentially the melanoma was not responding to treatment and has continued to grow. It also means that I'm now going to be changing treatments to a type of targeted therapy.

789,"If being kind annoys you, don't do it",11fdz0o,"Had the WEIRDEST encounter in a Walmart checkout a few days ago. I needed to buy cat food, and didn't think the tax on it was going to be two dollars, so I thought I had enough in my bank to buy it. For more context, I'm autistic and I've always been awful at math.   


So I was checking out, only to see I was like 20 cents short on the cat food. I seriously didn't think the tax would be as high as it was, so I defeatedly told the cashier to just take it off (figured i'd just go back and find a cheaper brand) The woman behind me, who was older, asked how short I was, and i replied ""Just 20 cents"" so she pulls out her wallet and hands the cashier a dollar for me.   


Obviously, I'm  very thankful towards her, and as I'm thanking her and telling her 'that means so much, thank you', her whole demenor changed and she couldn't even look at me, she had this annoyed expression and seemed to just want away from me. She wouldn't even say anything as I was thanking her. It made the entire interaction so awkward and I didn't even know how to take it. It felt like she just wanted me out of the line so she could check out, even though it wouldn't take the cashier long to take the item off.   


I appreciate her helping me, but why help someone if you're just going to make them feel like an annoyance in the process? I'm 29, this woman was old enough to be my mother...plenty old enough to have better manners than that. The whole thing just bothered me and I wish i could erase it from my memory. Seriously, if being kind is such a problem for you, don't even bother. I'd rather walk back, find a cheaper brand of food, than have to feel like trash at some old woman's feet.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over 2 years, and we‚Äôve been living together for a year. We have a ton of mutual hobbies - like playing video games, working out, watching anime, etc. Before we moved in with each other, we used to play games and watch tv with each other every night.  
Now we live together and that‚Äôs all changed. As soon as we moved, he became addicted to a game called League of Legends. I tried it a year ago and had an unpleasant situation which turned me off the game for a bit (later down the road I asked to play with my boyfriend again - more on this later). But now, it feels like he places League above me in the relationship.  
I‚Äôve talked to him about this MULTIPLE times, and brought up multiple solutions/ really focused on what bothers me. I told him that I feel lonely in the relationship because he would spend 12 hours a day playing the game (not exaggerating - there have been multiple times where he‚Äôd play from 9AM to 2AM, only taking breaks to eat). I‚Äôd ask if I can learn to play again - he said ok but never initiates. I‚Äôd ask if we can try out other games together, like Genshin or Valorant. I‚Äôd ask if he‚Äôd like to continue a few games that we started but never completed. I‚Äôd suggest he get into some of the games I play, and even showed him how to play. Even date stuff - I‚Äôm the only one in the relationship bringing up date ideas.  
And yet, no change.  
Meanwhile, my boyfriend would tell me that he joined a bunch of League groups because he ‚Äúhas no one to play with‚Äù and wants a group of friends. He joined a Discord channel and would ask multiple people - even late at night, when I‚Äôm free and not working - if they‚Äôd like to play a round with him. Or tell them he‚Äôs willing to stream another game he‚Äôs playing. The last time we spoke about this, he said he‚Äôll take more initiatives to ask me to game.

800,Some distant family is trying to get me to sell a house/property I inherited from my dad.,11f2omc,"So, long story short: When my dad passed away, I inherited his home and land. I make a little money from crops and it's my only source of income. About a week ago, I get a phone call from a cousin wanting to buy the place. (I had been living there until I found out the house has a bad moisture problem and will cost more money to repair than I have, but I digress).

 I had to tell him several times that I have no immediate plans to sell now and that I would possibly sell it in a year or so. Well, yesterday he texted me asking if I had thought more about selling it... and it hasn't even been 2 weeks since the phone call. This guy barely had anything to do with my dad (and me for that matter). And it turns out he got my number from his parents, who barely had anything to do with my dad as well. Seems they only came around when he got sick or was in the hospital...

Anyway, I was pissed off. I just deleted the text and blocked him because I don't want to be bombarded with messages, calls, and voicemails. I feel like I am being pressured into making an impulsive decision and I don't want that kind of stress in my life right now. Honestly I want nothing to do with these people.

I‚Äôm upset that he cut us off, but pissed that he chose to do it at 12am in the morning, where everyone in our family is asleep in their respective areas and he knows it! 

He went on this rant about having to protect our mom from us and that we are hurting her, like wtf. What the hell did I do? I‚Äôm not the one living with her with two other babies, so what the hell is he talking about?!

You know this is exactly like the day we moved out: almost brand new 18 and graduated high school not a month before. The day we were loving out he almost literally kicks open our door and just begins hitting us with a random belt.

There were 100 better ways to handle that but he chose the most violent because he‚Äôs just a damn bully who feels like his two autistic step kids are burdens! It wasn‚Äôt until we called our mom and resolved the situation that we were finally able to head back to grab our shit!

Yet he all trying to be like ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have had to do that if you did your part‚Äù and ‚Äúwe can make this (in regard to moving out) fun!‚Äù

‚ÄúParents can‚Äôt be their kids friends, parents are supposed to be in charge.‚Äù

I wish I could say I didn‚Äôt, but he scares me. Physically, mentally, politically and emotionally, he scares me the same way I‚Äôm afraid of wasps: scared that I hate them.

God, why is he like this? What in the hell possessed him to adopt us if he just going to always yell at us, always just shrug when we tried bonding with him, always finds a way to escalate our already strained relationship?

I want to give in, I want to cut him out of my life and forget he exists. to forget all the things he‚Äôs put me and my brother through, but my brother is right: we can‚Äôt leave our half siblings alone without having someone they can trust if he tries what he did on us, on them. 

I can‚Äôt leave mom either.

809,People who say there are no original movies being made anymore,11eu2wc,"Original movies are being made frequently and are not hard to find if you actually want them. There is a website called MovieInsider that lists upcoming movies in theatres and streaming, a lot of original ones are listed alongside the remakes and sequels you keep whining about. Go to your local teatre and see what's playing. There are some originals that probably have lots of seats available. Go onto Netflix and Disney+ and check the sections with exclusive original content, some of it is remakes and sequels but some of it is also originals and adaptations. Go on Wikipedia and see the lists of upcoming original releases on those platforms. No apparently you lazy fucks only want to know if it's advertised in your face. Ironically, you probably also bitch about seeing advertisements. You don't give a fuck if original movies are being made or not, you just want to complain. When you do see original films, you usually aren't satisfied then either. 

Every single time a remake or sequel is advertised on Facebook, another hundred morons ask why nothing original is being made. Does news about remakes and sequels just make you suddenly forget every recent original movie? Why do you consistently make yourself look stupid like that? Some recent original movies are pretty well known, like Encanto. And then when I point it out to you, you get mad that I thought you didn't know about Encanto. So why did you say there are no recent original movies? You gave the impression you didn't know. 

If you cared about whether original movies are coming, you'd make a point to know. I don't play video games and I have no idea what ones are being released soon. But gamers know. Because you keep track of upcoming things you're interested in. I keep track of announcements of book series I like without needing them advertised on tv. My Mom is a fan of certain authors and knows their upcoming books. I don't know how she knows, I assume there are websites she checks just like I do for series I like. If you care, you look these things up. I told someone on Facebook that she would look it up if she wanted to know a movie was out and explained that I periodically look up upcoming movies. She accused me of being obsessed. Do you think it takes hours to read a list of upcoming movies? When did it become unusual to follow news about what you're interested in? 

If you cared, you would know original movies are being released. If you don't care, fine. It's just annoying when you complain about something you don't care about. If it doesn't matter to you, why are you whining about it? I think you just don't want remakes made and are using an ill-informed excuse to object. Just don't watch remakes if you don't want to. Since you don't care about movies, it shouldn't affect you. If you really want to see original movies, go see them. The existence of a remake or sequel in the next room isn't taking away your ability to see an original movie, your own apathy is. I actually pointed out to people the upcoming original Disney movies and they said they don't watch Disney anyway, almost degrading me for caring about Disney. Well if you don't care, then why do you care if they make remakes? You aren't watching either way. 

Do you know why there are remakes and sequels? They make money. Know why? Because even the people whining are more likely to see a remake or sequel than an original. Especially since these whining fucks apparently aren't movie fans. Ask yourself how you decide what movies you see. Odds are you are more likely to see movies related to a movie you have already seen and are familiar with. Even more so for people who don't see movies often. Odds are most of you whining fucks are still watching remakes and sequels and contributing to the demand. If you want to see original movies, see them. If you don't actually care, stop whining.",WildJackall,0,1,0.67
810,I hate how holier-than-thou my friends can be,11et1to,"So I joined a new school in September and made friends with this group of girls who were mostly all new as well. It was fine until I noticed that they were ignoring me. Every time I spoke, they would all go silent or just refuse to acknowledge that I had spoken and I was really confused as to why this seemed to happen every time without fail. I already had really bad social anxiety and so naturally, my mind started to run with all the possible reasons they were ignoring me to do with my personality like maybe if I wasn't contributing to any conversations or if they thought I wasn't interesting enough to give their attention to. I was so anxious around them after that and would overthink all of my interactions with them.

There was one of them especially that I had talked to a lot at first since we were both into k-pop but who also started to ignore me. They silenced me a lot of the time and this caused me to isolate myself and become quieter due to my fears of being ignored again. I eventually went to this other girl who I didn't exactly hang out with, but who was nice and a good listener after a few months and explained what was happening and she told them how their behavior was affecting me negatively and they apologised and made an effort to include me more. The thing is, there still wasn't much of a difference in how they treated me. So a few weeks later, I returned to this girl and told her that while I appreciated her help before, I still felt like there wasn't much of a change. 

I actually only found out a few hours later that one of them fell out with this girl and so me going to see her was instantly regarded as ‚Äúsnakey‚Äù and ‚Äúbackstabbing‚Äù when I was literally unaware of the beef. 

So turns out they found out that I had gone to her and found a problem with it, saying that I had only gone to her to spread bad information about them and rant to her about how terrible they were. Then they proceeded to criticise me and say that I can sometimes come off as rude and dismissive and that the real reason I was being ignored was because of a comment I made when I had first met two of them that had offended them. A comment I had apologised multiple times already for making as I realised how it could've been taken the wrong way as soon as it left my mouth. What angers me the most though, is how these group of girls act like they are free from all criticism for ignoring me simply because I had made a comment that I had held myself accountable for. 

Everybody makes mistakes and these girls were acting like they were saints. 

If you know me you know that I absolutely HATE when groups of people ignore someone as punishment for something the person has said that they don't like. If someone has offended you, tell them immediately rather than making them question if they was another reason to them getting ignored because the person may not have even been aware. 

I feel like ever since I made the remark, they've begun to enjoy twisting up my words and overanalysing what I say to make me look bad even though it's evident that I never meant it that way. For example:

Let's say we were having a conversation about how remarriage is frowned upon in a certain place and I said, ‚Äúoh yeah I just feel like remarriage in so and so place is frowned upon. a lot of people don't mind it but some do.‚Äù and then they would be like ‚Äústop generalising them, everyone does it‚Äù despite me literally acknowledging that the entire population doesn't think like that. The conversation would literally be about that particular place as well. 

They also go out of their way to paint me as disrespectful or impolite even though I try so hard to be mannerly. I just feel like I can't say anything now and not have it depicted as offensive so I've become quiet and closed off because I don't want to say the wrong thing. These girls have a lot of strong opinions about things tbh and they get mad at anyone who has a different viewpoint and it irritates me sm. They regard any other opinion was ‚Äòwrong‚Äô before even hearing me out. And I know they've definitely talked about me behind my back to people even outside the group and it makes me feel like maybe I am a bad person? maybe I do lack manners and have annoying habits?

813,Job search not going well and I feel like I'm starting to build resentment towards my girlfriend.,11ere7l,"This is my final semester. I've been looking for jobs since September of last year. I have not gotten any offers at all. Even today, I was rejected from a place that required no experience, college degree (which I have for this field), and labeled entry level. When asked why, I was told they offered it to someone with TWENTY YEARS OF FUCKING EXPERIENCE. And this isn't the first time that someone with far too much experience got the position. It infuriates me that I can't even begin my fucking career because someone over qualified was able to get it and work for nothing.

I told my girlfriend last year that wherever she goes, it will impact my job prospects. She just brushed it off and said ""you can get a remote job though"" or ""I don't want to live in the city"" where jobs for the two of us would be. Instead, she moved to a small town far from anywhere where the jobs are because it was a better opportunity for her. Initially, I was happy for her. But now I wish she would've tried to look elsewhere instead. It feels like I'm on the verge of either giving up on everything I worked four years for just to live with her and work some shit dead-end job or leave someone I care about and want to spend my life with so I can move miles away for a job that can help me get started but will probably suck at first. Either way feels like a lose lose. The worst part is when a few people say I don't really love her, which irks me because they've clearly never been put in a shitty situation like this. Where they have to choose between sacrificing their future and sacrificing their loved one.

I just feel so lost and hopeless. This has been stressing me constantly to the point where I think it's causing health issues. I barely sleep at night thinking about it. It's hard to focus on my school work because I'm so worried I won't even find a goddamn job. And if so, what is the point of finishing this degree if I've applied for 40 jobs within a surrounding area and still have no bites. I didn't even enjoy going to college. I genuinely didn't like the culture here. And do I really want to work with people with degrees who will be as bland and boring as a stale cracker? And even if I wanted to pursue something else, who will take a college student when the job requires manual labor? People in trades seem to look down on college graduates. They wouldn't want me in the first place.

Last week started the worst fucking time of my life. I went to get a biopsy done due to abnormal cells found during a pap. They said I‚Äôd bleed, but I know they didn‚Äôt mean as much as I did. I bled and bled and bled. I called a friend who had the same procedure done and she said hers absolutely was not like that so I went to the ER. After two pelvic exams and having some clots gotten out, I was told - 5 hours later - that there wasn‚Äôt a visible wound to work with and that bleeding was the name of the game. Go home and if I soak through x amount of pads in x amount of time, come back. 

I go home and somehow manage to get some sleep. Idk how but luckily I have an air up mattress and fashioned myself a faux fucking diaper from pads and passed out. I wake up in the morning and my body feels heavy and weak so I decide to go to the bathroom to see the damage. I pass out and blood just.. gushes out of me for what felt like 5 seconds and I just sat in it while I regained enough strength to get to the toilet and change my shit. After this I couldn‚Äôt get up at all without wanting to pass out. I call my dr office and they tell me to stay down while they talk to the dr and run my tests early. 

I then get told my DELIGHTFUL news: it‚Äôs invasive cervical cancer but they don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs advanced beyond my cervix so I‚Äôll have to start treatment. Okay fine. I‚Äôm fucking shivering and in and out of sleep from blood loss so the news barely registers. Luckily I‚Äôm no longer bleeding much. My sister brings me donuts and jerky and electrolyte drinks. Friends buy me food and I stay in bed bored for days because of the blood loss. 

I‚Äôve had bad headaches and exhaustion all week and obviously am told by my PCP that I am anemic due to blood loss. The supplements are making me nauseated constantly but the headaches are the dullest of roars. I should be happy about that but if it‚Äôs not one thing it‚Äôs another. 

Thursday I have my consultation. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared of them saying it‚Äôs advanced and I‚Äôm scared of the treatment options. I‚Äôm scared, tired and angry. I‚Äôm tired of being tired and I‚Äôm bored with everything. I‚Äôm tired of being scared and feeling on edge. I want Thursday over with so I have one less thing to worry about.

821,Absolutely shittiest day of my life,11ep3ap,"I'm a 21 year old Trans woman (mtf) living in Florida. I'm going to say this now I am not begging for anything and just simply need to rant about this. I just got a paper saying my rent was increased from $700 ($900 -$1000 with other bills) to $975 a month. ($1200-$1300 with other bills) Not only that I have to pay an extra $300 a month ($1500-$1600 with other bills)  just to stay in a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom 900 sqft shit hole of a house. 

(Reason why I have to pay an extra 300 just to stay is because the house only lets two people rent at a time since it's only one bedroom one house and that's pretty much a guest fee per month which they calculated by looking at different hotel rooms around the area, And no I'm not shitting you) not to mention it has a bunch of problems like the water heater not working right (hot water will come through for like 10 minutes and then It'll just go completely cold, and black mold we have to scrub out of the bathroom and also the exterior of the house is missing one support. It's not the prettiest place but at the time was affordable to pay for. 

We have three people living in here (my bf, gf, and I) and you might think three people should be enough to pay everything, well yes we are but barely including paying our own bills like phones and insurance and whatnot. My bf and I doordash in a pretty poor area (poor orders) in Florida but I do go out further south to Tampa/St. Pete area for the better orders my bf can't really because his car isn't in the best shape and can't really go too far without overheating. My gf works at Sam's club part time for $15 an hour.

Just rent in Florida is so ridiculous and especially with a lot of these places not fixing the shit that needs to be fixed leaving people to live in shitty conditions (ik there is people in Florida also dealing with the same thing and it's different for every person) but it's just not fair to people who rent to have to even deal with this and pay more for less it's bullshit.

I'm sorry if seems childish maybe a little I'm just so stressed I'm 21 and I'm trying my best to pay everything I can like rent, electric, internet, car lease, car insurance, health insurance, hrt services, hormones, phone lease, phone bills, my credit cards, etc just really difficult to live here. I want to make content for YouTube and live stream and also I make OF content as well to try to help with bills but now I have to put that on hold and work a lot more to pay for everything. I will make my content whenever I have the time too but it's gonna be really difficult to do especially also with dealing with family being arrested and some other family trying to send people to hurt me because I am Transgender.

I'm really trying my best to work hard and make everyone happy and help others in anyway I can and pay my bills and live a happy life but every turn I go it always feels like I'm going down spiral. I want things to be okay and I'm willing to work hard for it I'm just having a very hard time trying to deal with everything all at once.

823,"Obsession with humanity isn't ""relatable.""",11eokhz,"Since /unpopularopinion reddit is useless and just make up rules so that people can't use it, I guess I'll post here instead, since they seem to think that's where I'm supposed to go.

Anyway, Obsession with humanity isn't ""relatable.""

I see this so often as an excuse for stuff in media, especially video games. ""Oh, we can't show the struggles of other creatures besides humans because it's not RELATABLE!"" or ""Oh, these goodguy races inexplicably need to look like humans because it's RELATABLE!"" Yet, more often than not, ""relatability"" just feels like straight-up narcissism.

Let me take the reccent game Wild Hearts as an example. I'm going to be honest; I despise this game's story. Basically ""nature is evil. You gotta wipe out nature,"" and it basically depicts genocide against nature, mass expansionism and trapping animals in cages as a good thing. Like... I'm supposed to relate to this? The game doesn't show nature's struggle in the whole ordeal. It never has you protecting animals from the ""forces of evil,"" or show your actions directly helping the environment outside of some insincere cutscenes, and the only thing the writers did to make you feel less like a scumbag is let you ""pet"" wild animals. ....That's it. That's all they did. Because that's TOTALLY smart. Touching animals you see.

This game could have been more relatable. I get the impression that a lot of modern game designers assume we only care about humanity's struggles. they either assume the player doesn't care about nature's struggles, or they don't care themselves. In truth, I actually care WAY more about nature's struggles than humanity's struggles, most of the time. I would have LOVED to been able to protect an animal from a giant monster, or better yet, poachers. I would have LOVED for their to be legit focus on restoring wildlife instead of ONLY doing stuff that benefit humans, and that somehow trickles down into nature because ""potatoes."" I would have LOVED to have given befriended animals an actual nature preserve or a habitat they could roam around in instead of cramming them into tiny cages so they can crap out resources. This game did everything in its power to remind me WHY I can't relate to humans. ...At all.

Speaking of which, not everyone does. Many people actually DO relate more to anthros or monsters than humans. Some people have an easier time liking a character if it's aesthetically pleasing, while others don't care about looks and don't NEED their characters to look human. Heck, there's a whole sub-group of people who prefer anthros to humans, and they number in the several tens of thousands. I should know. In addition, many people actually DO care about nature and would love to legitimately help nature in a video game. ... Sadly, there just aren't that many games where you can in a meaningful way, and so many games where I was hoping I could defend animals or monsters from the antagonist, from Horizon to Witcher 3 to Elden Ring, etc. All of them disappointed and disgusted me. Horizon sees nature as nothing more than target practice, Witcher 3 felt the need to make its sympathetic ""monsters"" look like humans instead of actually making them feel like monsters, and honestly? These things don't feel like we're trying to relate to humans. ""These things feel like we're OBSESSED with humans.

And this bleeds into the real world, too. So few people I've met these days seem to have any compassion for non-human life. I'm constantly told how awful animals are, constantly seeing killing and destruction defended by people, and just about anywhere I try to vent my frustration, let off steam, maybe find people who feel the same way, just a desperate attempt to get any sort of relief... I am instead ganged up on and told how stupid and wrong I am every single time. I just simply have to get over everything. I am always made to feel worse about how I feel, even in reddits where I'd think my opinions and feelings would be more accepted. I don't even know why I'm bothering here, but a lot of this does explain why humans are so unrelatable for me. Yes, nature's not perfect, but at the end of the day, I have a much easier time connecting with it and relating to animals and true non-humans than I do humans and human lookalikes.",BennyJackdaw,3,3,1.0

We live in Sweden and it is famous for a pretty high cost of living. Lately he's been eyeing whole chicken as a means of still getting chicken parts plus bones for soup which we love.

I keep pressing him to give me a reason why he should not learn it and he can't give me any other than ""I have you. You can butcher it"". I am just so pissed at his attitude towards this.

829,The memory of my first love is destroying me,11egxlf,"A few years ago i was in a really dark place, my mother was a drug addict and her abuse had peaked, which is why i moved to my aunt (as a foster home). I had a really hard time there and the only thing making me happy was playing overwatch with my newely discovered discord friends. Alot of drama happened in that group over the years, i fell in love with a guy who was 6 years older than me (i was 16 at the time) and as time progressed i just got more and more obsessed with him. We spent time in a group almost every night, but things were weird as well. When i told him i loved him i had already realised that we were never going to work out, we've had many talks because i was just too selfdestructive and wouldnt really believe when people said they liked me. 
Which was something that would make me do dumb things. He was always the guy with a dirty humor, i liked that alot because it just seemed like freedom to me. I sent him things, told him things noone else knew about me or had seen, i would look up to him when my life had hit rock bottom. But since he didnt feel the same way (no hard feelings on that) ofcs he couldnt reciprocate. He got closer with another girl outside our group and eventually invited her in too. Things got worse when i developed panic disorder and drank excessively. They tried to help me but after a while as they said ""when you dont see a change, u dont really wanna try anymore"". In retrospect, i think it was pretentious to believe they could help me. Anyway, it all just became a mix of me wanting to be liked, to be loved, and also pushing everything away. Until a fight broke out that made him leave the group. I was devestated, that group was my family. And i felt like i was being pulled on two ends, even tho i wasnt. At some point, He and the girl mentioned earlier got much closer than i couldve, which made me wonder: how much can u try and still fail, why was i never enough, was it because i wasnt as good at the games we played? Was it because i just had too many ills and troubles? I even tried to just hide all that at some point but knowing that he really didnt see me as even just a friend anymore, or at least believing so, drove me crazy. I had been lied to so much, i had been left out and laughed about even when i was told to speak up if something was wrong. At some point he told me about how he had had a girlfriend all this time and that he had lied about his identity. I wouldve never opened myself to him had i known how much of what i loved was a lie.
 I felt like i broke.
And then, after even more time, i gave up, asked to leave without ill feelings. Which he didnt care about. The girl, whom i had also become close friends with, still cares somehow, but we are all aware that we cant be friends the way we mightve been. It hurts me. Alot. I did everything. I cancelled plans, i changed my hobbies, i started smoking, because of him. And now?
I still care. I will always care. Right now im so hurt and mad that i put all my youth into him. I wish i could rip out my eyes and break my legs to feel another thing. I dont want to remember his lies, his dumb internet identity, his disgusting way of treating people. I wanted to dox him, to give him a scare after years of misstreating. But in the end its my own fault for staying so long, for trusting and being naive. I just wish he had let me see his real character for once. I wish he had been more honest with me. I just want my memories gone because i know at some point he cared. But i never got better. This has been going on since 2018.
Im alone now. I broke contact with everyone except the girl i mentioned earlier. I dont believe in a chance to talk to him again and ive thought about breaking contact with her too because i constantly remember everything. After all, she did just as he did. 
Im just so full of rage, things i used to enjoy just make me sad, i cant even go on my pc anymore without thinking of the hours ive waited for him, the nights i spent on discord having fun, when now ive completely isolated myself.

832,"Thinking you're entitled to use TikTok isn't a ""free speech"" issue",11eekl9,"I just heard this argument recently and was floored that someone could attempt to make it. There's nothing related to free speech in the reasoning that TikTok needs to be banned. You don't have the ""free speech"" to effectively harvest data about everyone you're in communication and proximity with and send it to China. That's not free speech, that's negligently criminal behavior. It's the equivalent of taking a computer infected with all sorts of viruses and spyware to a new house with roommates, plugging in, and infecting everyone on the network, then ignorantly arguing that it's you're right to do so. It's just a recklessly clueless approach to the responsible use of technology. TikTok has openly and explicitly admitted now to the app functioning like this, anyone who hasn't accepted this by now is not even paying attention to what's going on in the world. It's insane that people think that the government shouldn't have the ability to ban dangerous applications. How exactly do you think cybersecurity at the national scale would work without the ability to take such measures?

Your freedoms end when they start to objectively impact other people in significant ways. TikTok has shown to do that. It's like trying to argue you should get to drive with a nonfunctional braking system, except those bad brakes are aiding a hostile government. No one gets to brutalize other people's privacy and security just because they want to be entertained. That's literally one of the most pathetically and childishly entitled attitudes I've heard of lately to attempt to justify unethical behavior. 

People need to wake up to their own bullshit occasionally and quit pretending that their hilariously limited understanding of technology means that they really have any useful defenses to make about all the dangerous things they do online. Half of the people trying to defend their TikTok use couldn't even show me how to operate a basic file system, yet have this cocksure attitude about acting, effectively, as a spy for the Chinese government. What a joke. Same type of people who couldn't even explain to me the value of encryption, but yeah, you should totally be allowed to even touch a piece of network enabled technology, genius.

Well, she thinks it's better spent on me losing weight. Yes, I know I should. I have been doing some research, but I need more motivation. It's great she wants to help me, but I am disappointed that I have to use it for something that was not what I was expecting. But this is nothing new. My whole life she gives me what she thinks I should have rather than what I want. I kept thinking she really doesn't know me, but it's really what she expects of me. Like clothes she gives me. I tell her to stop doing it because I don't need it. Her style is not the same as mine. I get some fancy clothes, but honestly, it's for a more mature person who is going to a fancy outing. She has always been trying to dress me as if I am older. Like as a teen, she tries to dress me like I am 30, going to work in an office. . I end up sending it back to either get the credit for something else by the same place or refunding it. I appreciate she is sending me something, but wouldn't it be better to give me something I will use rather than return? Now the money will sit with her bank account until I can make up my mind on what kind of weightloss program to use. I have had some rather large expenses recently. I told my mother that the car motor blew up on the way on my trip. That was an unexpected expense that took up the money I was going to use for a new couch.

But because there are so many pressing issues in today‚Äôs society, many of them are often looked past because they are deemed less important than others.

One of these ‚Äúless important‚Äù problems is ageism. I‚Äôm tired of adults looking down on teenagers for the way they act, dress, and behave. And I‚Äôm not going to deny the fact that I am relatively biased because I am a teenager myself, but that doesn‚Äôt discredit the things that I‚Äôm saying.

Just because you are in a different stage of your life does not mean you are smarter, stronger, or more mature than people who are younger than you.

A lot of adults don‚Äôt understand this or won‚Äôt admit it, but they are not the superior beings in this world. The future rests in the hands of the generations that come after you. That‚Äôs why being a good parent is absolutely vital.

840,What do I make of my lady friend? I feel suffocated even though shee rarely writes,11e7hl2,"
Good day to you all!


My father passed yesterday. I am left with my mum and little sister and mum‚Äôs mum. The question I have is about a twelve years older lady who writes me everytime something bad happens to me. I don‚Äôt know if it is a coincidence or that‚Äôs how soulmate stuff works. 


I had a short romance with her two years ago but she‚Äôs been coming back to me all the time. We haven‚Äôt really spoken during these two years only short convos where she would try to make me jealous or just say that she loves me. I showed her to my friends and they said that this one is crazier than the previous gf that cheated, manipulated etc. I have had a feeling that she had found me because I would be a good target. She gets alot of male attention but she dislikes pretty much everyone who gives it to her because theyre rude. She will be 44 shortly and wanted to have my child even though she would deny it. My mum concluded that that is what she wants from me and it is her instinct kicking in. I make ok money and have had stable work for a long time. I don‚Äôt want children at the moment and would prefer someone else‚Ä¶younger. I believe she has subtly suggested that if I don‚Äôt get her pregnant now I will regret it when she won‚Äôt be able to have childred(this happened two years ago). After three weeks or so of dating and having her lecture me about me she expressed that out of all that she could have atleast gotten pregnant and cunningly smiled. Later this was her getting angry, lecturing me everynight, maybe blocking me and then calling me in the morning and begging me to forgive her. When it would be ok between us she would lecture me about how bad chips(crisps) are then eat all the bag. (I liked them with beer).


So now it is two years later. I don‚Äôt have any other girl running after me and am a bit confused. The girl problem is a me problem. I wonder maybe I am just a selfish ahole. My mum and gran say that spending some time with her would be good for me, they advised separately not to promise her anything but I have never told them about the bad stuff happening and I get an eww almost everytime she messages me. She would appear just to tell me that she is in a loving relationship and then tell me that she loves me. Or drop by to ask how I am doing. This is regularly about every 1.5 months. This time was final goodbye I thought, then she writes me and then bam my dad‚Äôs dead. 


What do I think of this girl? Is she bad luck? She dumped the only serious bf who wanted kids to enjoy herself or something and now she is childless and for some reason her brother also which according to her will never have kids because of him being a mama‚Äôs boy. I admit that I have been enjoying the attention but I always say we need to part ways and this is just friendly talk (or me ignoring her and then it is like she is talking to herself) as I need to marry someone who is my mum‚Äôs nationality(not really true, but probably) and have almost begged her to leave me alone, blocked her then unblocked because well I could just ignore her that would be manlier. I did find her beautiful and a little weird but ok but alot of guys have said that she is really weird. Well so am I abit so I guess we did have something more in common. 


And this time I was the one who mentioned her in a conversation with a collegue and next day she says I was on her mind and wants to go to a forest with me if I will want to or wont be seeing anyone when I am available. 


It‚Äôs almost evening, I have not slept all night. I wrote this in the morning. I probably have to take care of everyone now and I am also stressing about this lady friend.",Temp2106,0,1,1.0

843,I screamed at a 16 year old boy and threatened him after finding out he had been groping and following a 16 year old girl for months leaving her terrified. Will prob get hate but I don't have any regret?,11e38gb," 

Short story really. Own a few businesses one being a gym, People of all ages come obviously. Girl of 16 (legal age here but doesn't change anything) Anyway the girl of 16 who often comes here asked if she could speak privately with me (I do a lot of charity work anti knife crime, Free classes for women etc, a lot against rape, abuse stuff like this) so it's quite common for young adults or young people to come and see me one on one. Anyway I took her into office and said Hey what's up. I knew her so-so not as close I am with any of the others.

Anyway she comes into the office with me sits down and explains to me a situation she has had with another gym member also 16. She says he has slapped her bum on a few occasions, asked her out she's told him no at first nicely but now nasty because he wasn't getting the hint but he had groped her. Obviously I said this was strong stuff I said you got any proof or anything? Which she did she showed me countless messages that without a doubt proved her right.

Ok I asked her what she wanted to do, She didn't want her parents to know and she didn't want to report him. I told her i'd have a word with him properly about it and get back to her. She gave me a hug and left.

That same day I went outside to where the trash is kept for the gym it's basically a huge dumpster. and by the side of it was Andy the boy she had reported. I'd been waiting to see him but was quite shocked why he would be here as this is at the back of the gym almost down a corner (no way near entrance)

Hey you alright? I said Obviously knowing I was going to ask and take him back to the office to discuss this. What you doing here mate?

To my shock his answer was. Well Melissa is usually working at co-op and She has been avoiding me and walking home a different way because she knows I know her route. So I found out she been coming this way and I was gonna pop out and be like ""Oh what a surprise it is to see you here!""

Obviously my jaw nearly hit the floor at this.

Right I said, so she's told you to leave her alone? ""Yeah she said she is scared of me"" Right. Are you a fucking retard? He went quiet are you fucking stupid or something I said? What... what I realize im a lot bigger then he is but felt this was needed.

I said are you a fucking idiot or is there something wrong with you I don't know about? Do you have some kind of mental condition I'm unaware of? ""No Chris..."" Right so a girl tells you, you are scaring her asks you politely to leave her alone and you grope her? Abuse her and start following her home?

He didn't reply So I asked him are you a rapist then? No reply again. You been touching her up without her consent and she's clearly made it clear she doesn't like it or want it? she's told you she's scared so are you a fucking rapist? If she reports you everyone gonna see you as one lad eh? I fucking see you as one. You not thought you ruining her life upsetting her or what you fucking doing? He went on about being scared now. I said not funny is it when your scared and someone wont leave you alone eh? Want me to perform a citizens arrest on you and get her to ring the police? Want her to tell your parents? everyone on social media? he was pretty much crying ""no"" I said ok want me to slap you for what you done? ""no"" Ok pal. I went upto his face and said LEAVE HER THE FUCK ALONE. your banned from gym now. And if I find out your bothering her I fucking swear. He said he wouldn't.

It's been about 2 months now and she says he hasn't bothered her at school or anything but still. I dunno maybe I went too far but it was the sheer yeah i'm following her home. and the way he had no concern for anything he was fucking doing. I told him ""This is not normal behaviour andy"" This is not how you fucking treat women or anyone pal

I tried to grow my nails out and then my best friend of the time  (who doesn't have a filter, but doesn't mean to hurt people) said I looked wierd with longer nails, so I gave up. I've tried different ways to get people to stop looking at me and my nails. The first way (which was really hard to do but I'm quite good at it now) is to not bite my nails in public, only at home or in private. it tends to work due to me practising this for a good few years now. The second was to imagine the dirt and grime (that i assume is) underneath my nails. Sometimes that works, but if I'm desperate, usually this tactic doesn't work.

Last year around may, I needed to close that company and asked them about the process, they charged me $1,200 to do it, which was pretty high, but they were the only thing I knew, so I paid for it.

Nope everybody and their God damn dog decided to come all at ONCE literally we had 3 or 4 people walk in at the same time 3 or 4 cars pulled in ! So Iam trying to do both and people are upset that I can't do both counters at once ok 1 FUCK YOU ! No seriously fuck you you see me taking orders, making drinks, and passing out food and trying to run literally run to front counter and your sitting their sighing under your breath well Iam sorry you have to wait a whole minute or two (yes I time myself) while Iam trying to do TWO jobs at once !

Number two extra fuck you points if your the type of asshole who rushes and acts like your big shit and have to be somewhere in the next 5 seconds and your basically screaming though the speaker or standing at front counter saying ""DoEs AnYbOdY wOrK hErE ?"" impatiently then when I finally get to you 30 seconds later ""Oh YeAh It WiLl Be A mOmEnT"" WHAT THE ACTUAL AND LITERAL FUCK ! ? 

Number three suck a GIANT dick if your the alpha douchebag who has his truck muffler so fuck'n loud I can't hear you or the car behind you and you basically whisper your order and don't have the good graces to turn the mother fucker off ! Seriously your a piece of God damn shit ! 

Your so God damn desperate for attention it's sad and pathetic and Iam not talking about just the trucks Iam also calling you out little shitty floor bangers that's missing BOTH bumpers, smells like weed and gasoline, that has at least one or two BIG dents in it from you hitting and running somebody, with one god damn hubcap, a cracked windshield, and is dirty beyond all shit it looks like you left this in the garage after you got done shitting it out ! WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO IMPRESS ! ? 

Now we have honorable mentions right here this one goes out to all the asswipes that have the phones connected to their car and they choose to try to talk to me AND the person on the phone at the same time CHOOSE ONE ! I can hear BOTH of you and it's fuck'n annoying !

Honorable mention number two goes to the god damn dick gobbler that decides to read the whole god damn menu in the MIDDLE OF LUNCH RUSH then decides to order after three cars pulled up right behind you it's god damn tacos Iam not sorry but Jesus Christ ordering tacos shouldn't be a 10 minute life or death scenario !

Last honorable mention goes out to the ball sucker that lets somebody else order that's NOT the driver if your not going to be talking please let the person who is ordering drive or order your God damn self the speaker is supposed to pick up the DRIVERS voice and order NOT the person in the passenger side, NOT the person behind you, NOT the person behind the passenger side, YOU THE DRIVER !

Now lastly eat a BIG, veiny, flesh colored bag of gummy dicks if your the doucheinator that does ALL of these things ^ as well as drive into my drive at 50-60 miles per hour and SLAM on your brakes at the last moment, I fuck'n want your license taken away not only because are you recklessly driving and putting everybody at risk with your bullshit and causing UNNEEDED wear and tear on your car but also because that high pitched screeching goes straight into my ear all at once though a microphone ! AND IT FUCK'N HURTS ! 

Now I know what people will say so here's my counters yes I would love to have more coworkers but I don't do the hiring and firing my boss does, even if I did do the hiring and firing so many people here (in my city specifically) DONT wanna work and Iam not going to blame a single demographic because I have seen it time and time again with people though all walks of life, yes I am looking for another job Iam basically in the process of ""here's your start date welcome aboard"" ""ok boss here you go fuck'n SUCK IT !"", now lastly ""is there another position you can do ?""/""well somebody else can do drive right ?"" The answers are yes I can cook, do front counter, line, fry food, I can do it all except office work BUT Iam usually locked in drive because the other positions are taken and nobody else wants to do drive they will moan and look for reasons to be anywhere else but in drive so I take it because nobody else will and some of us literally can't",Awildtrainerappeared,0,1,1.0

874,Passwords Drive Me Mad,11dinqi,"I can't be the only one who is driven mad by the password requirements in our daily life? 

I just recently switched to a new phone and it is maddening the number of passwords that I can't remember. Every password that I have ever used needs to be retyped. Every website or app has different rules for passwords, such as specific character count, special characters, etc. 

If it were my choice, I would use the same few passwords for everything, but I can't do that because the rules for each website make it impossible. So now I have to retype all my possible passwords into every app or website and hope that I figure out what weird specific rules they made me use on my regular password so I can type it without using the dreaded forgotten password link.

About that forgotten password link, almost every time I use it and I go to set my password up, the message is always the same, you can't reuse a password that was already used before. Usually because they finally tell me the password rules and I realize oh they require this special character but only after this capital or some other BS that my brain can't remember, but now I am screwed again because I can't just use the password I now realize is the right one because it is locked into a password reset, making it so I have to use another password that I won't remember the next time.

I tried writing my passwords down in a notebook as I figured I could reference them when I need to job my memory, but even that doesn't work. The pandemic made it so I have to work part time in the office and part time at home, so inevitably whenever I need my password book, it is in the opposite location, so once again, I need to use the dreaded password reset tool.

I feel like the intention of the password rules were to make it harder for folks to access your information but all someone needs to do is grab my password book and they have access to everything. It is like passwords are setup for some ominous hacker on the internet, when it seems more likely someone could just steal my password book and have access to everything, seeing as how I have to transport it between my home and office every day. My car has been broken into way more often in my life than my computer was ever hacked into, yet this is supposed to be more secure?

Why can't websites just let you use whatever password you want and let you reuse it as often as you want to use it? It seems to me that if I want to reuse the same password for everything, it should be my right to take that risk.",WitchUrsa,7,3,1.0

But today I received a message from a friend of mine saying one of her friends had a video of me that night. I opened it and after a couple of seconds I couldn't watch anymore and I deleted it. I saw myself on the ground and felt like throwing up. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE??? WHY WOULD YOU FILM THAT????? In what way could you think ""oh, someone's suffering, let me just film her primal screams"". WHY?? WHY??? 

I told her to tell his friend to never do something like that again, because it's disrespectful. The friend said he was just trying to film the ambulance. WHY? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? What's funny or interesting in that? And why did the video include ME, in the worst night of my life????? Why are people like this?",donnolermellino,2,1,1.0

884,Really get tired of the video game industry pushing out unfinished games,11dedpb,"I'm 31 and I'm just tired of companies releasing unfinished games and expecting full price. Also most games nowadays feel so rushed and underwhelming. I've been a long time pokemon fan and the spark just isn't there for me anymore. With each generation the graphics would wow me and I'd think damn we've come so far but scarlet and violet honestly just pissed me off lol The game was so laggy and had glitches that still aren't fixed and yet they're pushing out DLC and more cash grabs completely ignoring the issues the community is complaining about.

 Pokemon aside I feel like the gaming industry has just become obsessed around deadlines and using their customers as beta testers until a year...two years later....they get it right (maybe). It feels like there's no customer satisfaction anymore because they know you're still gonna throw money at them for a game.

My parents say they want to read it but they‚Äôve only asked like twice, I haven‚Äôt shared it, and they don‚Äôt care. I shared it with some of my friends on a discord and I talk about it there too.

Seriously though, viewing the topic from a different vantage is not an argument in itself and I‚Äôm tired of it being construed that way.¬†

Demanding that individuals who don‚Äôt agree with 100% of your viewpoint should be silent so as not to offend or disrupt the fun you think all are having in said conversation makes you a dictator. And if the only reason to have said conversation is to complain and focus on the negative, without actively trying to find understanding of the root problem‚Äîthen what is the point?¬†

Why bring up a topic if all you want is for everyone to agree with you about how bad/sad/unfortunate it is? Why not try to understand ways in which we can bring about change by diving deeper into the issue, rather than surface-level virtue signaling that you will likely post a selfie about with some tagged comment so everyone can see how much you truly care about said issue that means so much to you‚Äîso much to you that you disengage from any actual conversation about it that takes you out of the focus. It isn‚Äôt about you or me‚Äîcollectively, it‚Äôs about everyone/no one, and when you shut yourself out from other perspectives you shut yourself off from growth.¬†

There is knowledge to be found in other opinions, and it doesn‚Äôt have to make you feel uncomfortable. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt have to be offensive. In those moments, your opposing view doesn‚Äôt offend me, I‚Äôm not upset that you have it, and I won‚Äôt ever tell you to stop saying it. However, I will say what I believe, especially if it is a conversation directed at me and/or a group I am in. If you don‚Äôt want anyone to speak with you about that topic, then what is the point? Is it that you just want to dictate the conversation? How is that enjoyable? Do you even see how hypocritical you are? Ffs.¬†Part of me thinks it's because you don't really know too much about the subject, and you don't want to be found out.

897,emotionally exhausted,11d3ky6,"My luck was getting pretty crummy this month. 

But not too bad thinking back on it. But I'm a better person for it in some manner. I forget that physical growth spurts hurt, it would only make sense for maturity and wisdom to as well. I already have a dark sense of humor to boot.

The day before valentines day, my relationship of 6 happy years falls apart. They thankfully did it in person.

Always have manners, even at the worst of times. 

As I adjust to the single pringle life style on Valentines day at work, the store radio host literally says ""Today's theme is broken hearts"". And given its valentines day, every radio station is gonna be playing something romance related. Okay universe. Kick me while I'm down. Kinda cruel but okay.

I don't want to bring down the mood of my coworkers and pull my personal problems to work. So its like this.. silent suffering I willingly take on. So the week goes, a few slips on the ice here and there, and I start feeling iffy. Given I'm depressed, I haven't really been eating. On top of that, the week prior to the break up, I had an adverse reaction to a depression medication that caused me to not eat for a week as well fuck my sleep up. The price to better one's self seems a bit steep for me.

Health bill wise, I wasn't in the best of shape. With now having fasted for an untended month, my body was essentially a runaway train heading for a cliff, intentional or not. Mentally, my brain was smoking.  Well I taste the milk and it tastes off, it says 'sell by the 23rd'. But its the 15th at this time.

Just my luck that I grab the one bad gallon of milk and give myself food poisoning in a bid to Not starve myself as I emotionally heal. Its friday at work and the morning is fine. open the store and its an okay day, its been a rough week but I'm managing. My boss offers me tea, I happily accept given its been a harsh winter where we're at in Wisconsin. A while later after having the hot tea I begin to feel terrible heart burn. I've only ever felt this when drinking alcohol on an empty stomach. Gut rot. Well they give me tums and I drink water. 

As I try to continue work Nausea just kicks me. At lunch I called in to my boss and they understood given they saw my physical state. A day later I start to feel some what human again, I decide to have a sip of coke, but its new. It tastes Off. I took a test. I got fucking covid. Last person that I kissed. My now Ex. The day they broke up with me on monday. Wow. just my fucking luck. Lines up with my now onset of symptoms. 

The milk wasn't bad. It was my sense of taste. 

So I had to awkwardly call my ex to tell them to get tested for covid because they have crohns and alot of health issues. I don't want them to suffer, regardless of how broken my heart is, I still have a heart.   Well they tested negative, as did my roommate, as did my boss and coworker. I likely got it from a customer earlier in the week. So whilst some good came out of this. 

Only me getting sick. But now my favorite soda is dead to me. Awesome.  

As I recover in the fullest sense, I like to imagine something or someone was having a gag pulling at my leg this last week. I'm just thankful the week didn't end with a family death and me getting fired because that's how bleak my luck was beginning to turn out. 

Murphy's law was tattooed on my forehead by god it seemed. Hopefully my sleep study doesn't reveal something comical like a brain tumor, talk about shitty sleep walking origin story to boot.

898,Fuck YouTube for blasting me with ads of cancer survivors when my husband is dead,11d3eze,"Almost 3 years ago my beloved husband was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer that most often occurs in men between the ages of 10 and 30. After 2 excruciating and hard fought years, he passed this last summer. I am, as to be expected, still quite grief-stricken and barely making it through each day. 

Since his death, every goddamn ad I receive on YouTube is for one of several different children's cancer treatment and/or research centers. The ads are strictly testimonials from mothers speaking, through tears of joy, about how their baby ""made it,"" ""survived"" and ""oh what a miracle!"" I am at my fucking wit's end, the ads are constant. Every time I view one it's like the paper-thin scab that's just barely formed over the gaping hole in my soul is ripped off. All the feelings of longing, ""what ifs"", and just immense, indescribable pain come pouring out, often accompanied by tears.

Logically, I am glad these children survived their cancer but I am not the correct fucking target audience for this and now's not the correct goddamn time. I watch bullshit on YouTube when the quiteness of being alone and without my husband starts to feel deafening and in an effort to try and distract myself from the fact that I'll never feel whole again. I just want to mindlessly watch a damn video about Hilaria Baldwin's fake Spanish accent grift without being reminded how my husband was killed by cancer.

What hurts is how she sees me being mad at her for being with this guy, is me being nosey and not minding my business. Idk whether to just end the friendship for my own sanity or to quit being so close to her. She doesn't believe i care for her and isnt honest with me.

3) I've lost sensitivity to my penis.

I also have Emotional Numbness:

1) I feel NOTHING. I am emotionally flat all of the time. I can't feel negative or positive emotions. I can't feel Adrenaline, Arousal, Pleasure, Stress, Anxiety, Euphoria, etc.

I've gone to many Doctors and have had many tests done and tried different treatments all to no avail. I've had my Hormones checked, I've had an MRI of my Brain, Neck, Pelvis, and Lumbar. I've tried CBD Oil, Vitamins and Supplements, Cialis, Viagra, Wellbutrin, Rexulti, Trintellix, etc. Treatments have failed and Tests fail to pinpoint anything!

I just want to feel like myself again. I used to have a normal sex life and I could feel emotions strongly. I am sick of dealing with this!

The comments varied from a simple spam of ""Pedo"" to racist jokes followed by violent threats. Yet reporting these comments resulted in a ""These have been reviewed and have been determined to not violate our policies"".

I was in a Long Distance Relationship with someone for 3 years and was offered a position with ""His Engineering firm"" as a CAD Drafter. I did a formal interview with him Oct 9th 2022 over Zoom and we agreed that my start date would be Jan 9th 2023, that way I could finish up my seasonal job on Dec 1st, collect unemployment then move.

I fly out there and arrived at his place on Jan 6th... It turns out the company actually belonged to his Father and, the position I was offered didn't actually exist, as it was dependent on a contract which they did not get. Not only did he refuse to tell me that, but he was attempting to form a polygamous relationship between myself and another individual that I was unaware of. 


The move and having to find a place on short notice ate all my savings... I had $5k saved up by Dec... now I have $140 left to my name.

A. I've tried asking for help on various subs, however their rules don't mention anything beyond having an account older that 60 days with 400+ karma... only for me to get banned because I haven't used this account in 9mo to get away from threats/harassment. Any attempts to prove that I've been using an alt account just ends up with ""Sorry, I cant change the rules"" WHAT RULES????? They aren't even listed regarding activity(beyond 60 day account age and 400+karma) on the 5000+ word ""wiki"" covering the rules/requirements.

B. Before I got banned, someone trustworthy in their community offered me a loan, but backed out after I got banned... like wtf!!! The only thing it changes is that I can't post there.

They dragged me the new movie Jesus Revolution yesterday, about a church in So Cal called Calvary Chapel that kind started a Christian ""revival"" back in the 60's. Basically if you are not familiar this ""revival"", it was the start of the church trying to younger more hippy types. If that does not sound like the church to you, you are not wrong and getting to my first problem. I am sitting there watching a movie talking about opening your door to the broken, surrounded by people that agree... until it comes to actually doing anything.

&#x200B;

My parents are very giving to a point, they've helped me a lot while I struggled with depression and career (or lack there of). While I have seen that their generosity has limits that more than just lack of resources, I would consider them more average Christian and even person. However, I have a hard time calling anyone charitable when they don't vote that way and I know they support closing the boarder, for profit healthcare, etc.

&#x200B;

I could almost guarantee at least 90% of the theater I was in shared a majority of the same views, I don't know how charitable the rest of the theater was but I live in a very Christian conservative area (which is probably why it was fuller than I was expecting). I could go further but I want to get the actual

&#x200B;

The movie follows Greg, Lonnie, and Chuck (played by Kelsey Grammer which surprised me), if you are wondering why this stars three well all of the women get very sidelined. Greg's mom and girlfriend are probably the most prominent, but they literally only show up when Greg needs an emotional push. His mom (Charlene played by Kimberly Williams-Paisley and easily the second biggest name in the movie) barely has a character before the last third, she is shown to sleep around to get men to pay for things for her, ignoring Greg, and overall very selfish and only there to show had a fucked childhood. His girlfriend, Cathe, was in the movie a lot more than the other women, but even then she will literally disappear for good arts of the movie and only come back when Greg needs her to him out on his bullshit. I'm not even joking, she had this major moment where sister nearly died from a drug overdose and the next scene was focused on Greg being a dick and her calling him out on it. After that we don't see Cathe again until after Greg has his own near death experience and is there to tell Greg he should go to church, I'm not joking. Greg and Cathe's relationship started with them wanting to seek truth, to which it is implied they are doing so through drugs but after the aforementioned near death moments they join the church. At this point you might be wondering how they argue this is truth... it feels right, that's how. There's a literal moment after Greg goes the first time where leaves, Cathe follows and asks him what's wrong and he expresses concern that this is just another high and the movie gives no other explanation as to why it is anymore real than what they were getting from drugs was it feels different. If I was religious I would be pissed because there has to be more to why you are modeling your whole life after an imaginary sky dad than a feeling.

&#x200B;

By the way, that theme of truth was not limited to Greg and Cathe. When we first meet Chuck he is acting like a cliched Christian (every other one not in this movie) that thinks hippies are just drug fulled criminals and sinners and wanted nothing to do with them, an obvious ""oh something we change his ways"" moment. His daughter, Janette and easily the best character in the movie, basically challenged him to listen to one if they walked into their house, to which he accepted and almost immediately happened. She literally finds Lonnie on the side of the road wearing a ""God ‚ù§Ô∏è's Us"" shirt he made and brought him into their house to have him talk to Chuck. He goes a speech about how he spent years on drugs trying to find the truth of the universe and we have a generation doing the same but he got to the end and find the truth, Jesus... still not giving a reason why. This moves Chuck to bring him into his church which makes the more traditional side of the church uncomfortable, leading to a moment where he sits at the front of the church telling everyone that the doors will be up to everyone and doors go both ways, with one of the more traditional members making shoe of support for the hippies by literally walking across the aisle to sit with them (I literally heard my dad whoa here).

&#x200B;

This movie is not all around bad, the cinematography was pretty good and like I said Janette was entertaining for the three scenes she was not relegated to the background. Greg's background was also kind of good, basically his dad left him and his mom but he kept thinking he'll come back until his mom just told him he was gone, but then she later told him that he wasn't his actually father but adopted him (unsure if the she adopted him too or if was just the dad) and he didn't leave but she left him. The struggle the characters go through was also decent, but there was also a lot of ""yeah, no that's not how that works"". Like one guy literally only appears in two scenes, the barging into the church saying he needs help (an obvious drug issue) and the next being asked by a reporter if he was fully recovered and he said yes... just yes.

&#x200B;

See, you might've gathered by now but this movie's portrayal of drugs and specifically drug recovery is really bad. Lonnie is the most prominent example, as mentioned he had used drugs but stopped before the movie started claims god keeps him clean but Lonnie irl relapsed multiple times. It presents drugs as something you just need god, and that's not true at all and harmful present in anyway.  This whole movie is just another example of why I left the church. The ideas of opening your door, love, peace, and kindness are all good but the movie does nothing to tell us why god important to those things happening.",darkknight95sm,0,2,1.0
933,"GARBAGE this TRASH that, how about you give an actual argument?",11cdth9,"There is this recent trend on the internet that if someone doesn't like something, it's immediately considered garbage, trash, shit,...

A movie where the producer put all his love into but the story isn't on par with The Godfather? **Garbage!**  
A videogame with 0 bugs that has a very healthy playerbase but requires an active internet connection? **Garbage!**  
A board game where millions of fans put thousands of their income into and willingly drive to championships for, but the meta is not to your liking? **Garbage!**  
A song that has a lot of emotion put into it and people have fond memories towards, but it's played a little too much on the radio? **Garbage!**  
This anime seems to be very well liked, it's incredibly popular but seemingly a bit higher ranked than my personal favorite show. **Garbage!**

I fucking hate that word, people can't just list a set of reasons on why they think the product isn't to their liking. No, it's something that belongs in the wastebin. Media is either a masterpiece of garbage, nothing inbetween. Grow the fuck up. You're not a critic, you're sheep. People who use that word also absolutely refuse to go into discussion with you, they just call you a ""fanboy"" or ""simp"".

This phenomenon fueled by bias and herd behavior spreads everywhere and makes the internet an even more toxic place. In the past you had forums and discussions about certain topics, but now everything is shot down by hardheads using that one word.

Do you even know what garbage means? It's something you throw away in the wastebin. If you don't like something, say you don't like something. If something is bad, call it bad and give reasons on why it is. Downplaying entire fanbases by calling the stuff they like garbage is elitist toxic behavior.

But those people just can't understand it and move on. They whine about it and want SO desperately seperate themselves from them, in a very toxic way, like for example an age player that age plays or fantasizes about age play even slightly for sexual reasons is not permitted to even subscribe to an agere yt channel, comment or associate themselves with em even if they are even slightly into kink. 

On a youtube video titled 'i spent a day with age regressors' someone mentioned that they're into abdl, and of course there was a whole mob of people in the comments whining about how they feel 'disgusted' and that one person 'ruined their whole day', because she mentioned BDSM slighty, or on a video about age play somebody mentioned used the word 'dom' and of course everybody in replies was crying how they have ruined their whole mood.

So, between the carrier and me, they are informed at least four times they will cancel if payment is not made. 

My coworker did day what I did was enough. These are adults, and we don‚Äôt need to babysit them. Bit lately she has been up my ass relentlessly. ‚ÄúDid you just text them?

2,Chewed out a bully because she was picking on another lady,11wieoc,"Tl;dr: Regina George wannabe kept picking on someone for her looks, I almost beat her nose in.

I'm pissed off as fuck right now and I just want to get this off my chest.

I've got a group of friends that are all gym-goers, and I got to know them through my boyfriend. There are about 13 of us, including myself. 6 women and 7 men, everyone except one guy is a couple. We all go out for dinner together once in a while. Which is what we did today. The guys tend to talk amongst each other, us ladies tend to talk amongst each other as well. Sometimes you prefer the company of your own gender and there's no harm in that.

So we were just chatting, and I notice that one of the women (I'll call her Lin) kept taking subtle jabs at another woman (will call her Wen). I thought they were good friends or something, and were just having banter, because Wen seemed to smile and laugh. But as Lin continued her ""burns"", Wen looked more and more upset. And When wasn't returning the burns, so it wasn't banter.

These jabs were directed at her looks. Lin was pointing out how ""she barely had any eyebrows"" ""her hair looks like she got an electric shock"" ""she had so many pimples that they were starting to look like freckles"". The way she said these things seemed like she was trying to get the other girls to talk shit about Wen, like she was looking around to see if anyone laughed.

I wasn't paying much attention at first because I was in a bad mood (am in an even worse mood now), so I was watching videos on my phone while my friends talked. But Lin was starting to piss me off when I realised she wouldn't stop and I wasn't going to let it slide, even though I didn't know either of them very well.

Tbh shouting at her to shut the fuck up probably wasn't the best way to handle it (anger issues that I'm working on fixing). She was stunned for a bit, but instead of apologising or taking my advice and shutting up, she doubled down.

""What's your problem I'm just saying Wen needs to take care of herself her xyz is unhealthy she could be so pretty if she started skin care blah blah blah""

I have a very low regard for beauty culture. I think it's sickening how elevated beauty is in our society and it's been made worse by social media. People have a warped view of reality because the only people who are allowed a space on social media are people who have used makeup, filter, and plastic surgery to attain the impossible. If you're not pretty, you're worthless. Anything outside ""perfection"" is abnormal and abhorrent. I see how people with cystic ance, asymmetrical features, scars, etc are treated like they're non-human. It disgusts me.

Don't get me wrong. I don't hate makeup or plastic surgery. I use makeup and have had some work done on myself. They're just tools for self expression. What I hate is how they've been perverted and used as weapons.

I told Lin that being pretty is meaningless. It is a useless trait. I can't remember what she said after that, but it turned into an argument of her essentially asserting how beautiful she is (""It's literally so easy to have good skin. I have it"") and me trying to drill it into her thick fucking skull that she is not better than anyone and being ""pretty"" doesn't give her the right to treat others like dirt.

She went on to insult my own looks. Really couldn't care less about that. Ignored her because she wouldn't listen to me when I told her to drop it before things escalate. Until she fucking touched me. She pulled off one of my false eyelashes and some of my real eyelashes came off with it. It hurt, as yu can imagine. If she did this to me 2 years ago I would not have hesitated to clock her straight in the jaw. I'm glad I didn't but I'm not proud of the fact that I threatened I'd punch the prettiness out of her face.

Her boyfriend got involved since I threatened violence. My bf got involved a second after that. I ruined everyone's night essentially. My bf is doing damage control for me and I feel bad for him and everyone else except Lin. Fuck Lin.",somewhatrecalcitrant,2,5,1.0

4,Don‚Äôt make kids if you can‚Äôt afford taking them to a dentist,11whfdy,"I‚Äôm 25 in a month and this year was supposed to be a year for travels and growth but here I am paying thousands for a dentist. And hundreds for a psychiatrist.

I come from a poor family with an alcoholic dad who is evil, violent and potentially a psychopath and a mother with anxiety who tried her best. They never took me to a dentist or taught me anything more than ‚Äúbrush your teeth twice a day‚Äù. We couldn‚Äôt afford to continue treatment after a root canal once (got to the hospital after I had huge fever and passed out from the infection).

Went to a dentist check up few weeks ago and I need 2 fillings an extraction I just had today and a bridge to replace the gap.

I also been diagnosed with bpd and need long term therapy potentially pills too. I pay for all of this myself and my parents stopped supporting me financially at 17.

Do you know how this feels? It feels like shit. I want to scream into their face for abusing me my whole childhood. The things I‚Äôve witnessed in that house no one should have to see.

I just want them to help me for once. This is a huge cost and lucky me I had savings I can use for this shit. It‚Äôs like I have to fix myself and put myself together all over again. Paying for generational trauma and neglect.

7,I'm in constant physical pain and I'm exhausted,11wgnxk,"I (26F) suffer from sciatica and sometimes, the pain I feel is so much worse than other times. Sometimes, it's a small but noticeable ache down the back of my leg that doesn't impact my ability to move and other times, the pain is so debilitating that I can't get around the house without my cane or my mother's help. My sciatic nerve isn't trapped 24/7, but it is trapped at least 85% of the time. I also suffer from chronic back pain that's always worse in the morning (no scoliosis, just chronic back pain). Both the back and sciatic nerve pain have been going on for ~2 years now and I haven't been able to live my life as normally as I used to since they started. 

I can still work (although I've been told that I might qualify for disability) and I try my damnedest not to call in unless the pain is so chronic that I can't move on my own which I'm aware may be what's making it worse at times, but because I'm still physically capable of working when I'm not in chronic pain, I'd feel like a fraud for getting on disability in the first place because only 10% out of the 85% of the time that I'm in pain is debilitating while 65% out of the remaining 75% is only mild pain that doesn't impact my ability to take care of myself and the last 10% of the time, I'm not in pain at all (pardon the probably-incorrect math problem lol). 

I'm starting physical therapy for the 2nd time in the span of 2 years (I had to go to physical therapy for the same issues in 2021) because I work on a military base where random urinalysis tests are performed with or without reason, so my PCP is wary about giving me strong pain killers like hydro/oxycodone that might show up on a urinalysis if I get randomly selected for one while I'm on those drugs. I even discussed the possibility of surgery with him and he said surgery isn't gonna stop the nerve from getting trapped again some time down the road so that's not the best option in my case. 

The first time I did physical therapy, my therapist told me to do the exercises daily until I stopped waking up in pain. It was only supposed to take 4 sessions of physical therapy for the me to get results. Instead, it took 8 extra sessions (12 sessions total, so 3 months) for the therapy to finally work. Now, I have to go back to physical therapy for the 2nd time and I'm less than pleased. I'm 20-f$cking-6 and I'm not even enjoying this part of my life because I'm in constant pain that no amount of medical or self care can ease. I take pain killers like candy. I feel like I'm gonna spend the rest of my life doing physical therapy on and off. 

I just wanna enjoy my life. I don't wanna spend the rest of it in physical therapy and swallowing pain killers like soda to ease physical pain so I can get decent sleep at night lol",KarrieDarling,0,3,1.0
8,My boyfriend completely disregards my feelings for his dick and libido.,11wgkay,"

I see my bf around once every two weeks. I started my period n told myself no sex and that was the case last night. Tonight we get home and I can tell most likely we will be fucking. He makes a sex joke or something like that, and tells me to go shower. So I do so,and upon entering my room 25 minutes later I open my door to see him legs spread (and shaking!!) airpods in,jerking off to porn. I was so taken aback my first reaction was to laugh and close the door with me on the other side. So I jokingly said ""okayyy finish have fun"" with the most disgusted ick face on. He goes "" so you're really gonna let me finish?"" As if I'm a cool mom or something lmao. I enter my bathroom and I immediately start feeling my self esteem plummet. I text him,"" i guess lmk when you're done"" as a reply I get ""I"". Not even ""K"" cuz his hands are too busy. I text "" thought you were gonna wait for me but w.e"" NO REPLY. Hes busy. I send a sad face still nothing. So 5 minutes later I barge in ask if hes done,he wasn't but I told him to put himself away because im uncomfortable. I've been shut down since. I want to dump him,this isn't the first time he has disgusted me with his disregard for my feelings when it comes to him being horny. He's the type who will jerk off whilst im uncomfortable because he wants to cum and im too sore from previous night to fuck. Im very new to relationships but I'm pretty sure this is disrespectful. Or am I overthinking and am I the asshole for being uptight and not letting him finish? Idk why I expected him to call me back into my own bedroom to fuck once I caught him,but I guess the combination of his hand/porn is better.

TLDR: My bf and I planned to fuck,I shower and enter my room to find him shaking jerking off watchin porn. Flustered and grossed out I leave him to finish while I hide in my bathroom. And he lets me until I decide to renter my room and stop it. Is it me?",ReporterMaleficent41,3,1,1.0
9,Mid twenties with a bleak future where i'll never be able to afford a morgage or home,11wfbbx,"Just have to get this off my chest but lately i've been incredibly somber at my future, i've got a good new job and plenty of years ahead of me but doing some calculations, i simply wont be able to move out from my parents house. at most by myself i could get a morgage of about 150k euro's which is only about 40-50% of what i'd need to buy a house, even a small/old one. I dont want to blame anyone but the economy is fucked up because some boomers are buying up houses and renting them out for 2x the price of a monthly morgage payment, with absolutely no value other than a roof over your head for that month. The only solution i guess would be to find a partner but thats easier said than done, dating apps arent made for men, and women i do match with have less personality than a brick wall, so i commited the nr 1 sin according to many and decided to take a loot over the fence, the grass is always greener there right? so i make a female profile just to see what the dating world is like for a woman. didnt like anyone, i just let it run for about 5 minutes and got 350+ likes before deleting the profile again. It just made me more depressed, knowing that they probably dont have the personality of a brick wall, i'm just competing with about 300 other guys and any message i'd send would get flooded instantly.  


So here i am, living at my parents in my mid 20's with a good job but unable to move out, refusing to rent because i dont really fancy burning money tbh and kinda feel like im stuck in this infinite loop of needing a partner to get a decent morgage, trying dating apps only to realise there are indeed plenty of fish in the sea, but finding a hook as a fish is more difficult than finding a fish as a hook it seems.",Giedy5,0,1,0.67

12,You stupid idiot...,11wed8y,"I'm drunk but I will moderate myself. I want to write this as though I am speaking to the one who wronged me:

I vouched for you when the rest of my household said ""no"" to you living here. I defended your behavior because I know what the military did to you. I always had your back because your parents committed suicide.

I didn't just feel sorry for you. I loved you; in a way a brother loves another brother. We were born a year apart from different wombs, yet we were so much alike, you couldn't distinguish us in a group. We were the kind of friends that only existed on movie screens, in books, anime, or videogames. Nobody mattered more than you, except my wife. I broke myself for you. Ruined myself for you. 

And all you had was vitriol. Vile, venomous, cantankerous resentment to the family that took you in, when your own family rejected you. When you had no friends. When you bawled your eyes out to me about how you had nothing, after Nai left you. I was there for you, man. You told me I was your pillar for four years as I directed you through your relationship. 

Then, tonight, you lunged for my wife. Your hands were moving towards her throat. It was over at that point, man. I don't know why you thought that was acceptable. I don't know when your heart became so black.

I watched you chatting with that third group of police officers tonight. Acting like your life was so much better now. I was in the back yard recording you, for my wife's sanity. You actually had the nerve to say ""Aaahh, free at last,"" after pulling all that ""go through the courts to evict me"" noise? After trashing our house? After causing my autistic wife to have a 42 hour long meltdown, and saying it wasn't your fault? After ruining my wife's **BIBLE** of all things?

And then, after making our lives hell, you act like you were imprisoned here against your will... like I didn't even exist.

13,My Mother was an Utter Shithead,11wdwfg,"She's thankfully passed away years ago, but I'm just ranting here to get it off my chest and hopefully process it a little better.

She didn't care for me and was abusive. All she wanted was a kid who would fit some sick, misogynistic idiotic role she had planned and nothing else. She made sure my confidence was in tatters right from the start, positioning herself as both my saviour and tormentor. She kept me frightened, desparate, angry and paranoid. She made sure I only trusted her and no one else, yet emotionally tortured me on a daily basis and physically threatened me often.

I was not allowed to be myself or to grow up, only to conform to what she wanted, and what she wanted was a misogynistic idiot son to show off. I came out as MtF transgender her psyops bullshit intensified, she tried to ruin my confidence, destroy my friendship with my best friend and threatened to call the authorities on me because we were living in a country where being transgender could (Not guaranteed to, but could) get you prosecuted by religious authorities. 

In fact, when I showed feminine behaviour or inclinations my entire life, even before coming out, she'd mention those authorities. ""They'll put you in a camp, set you right"" she'd say. ""They have their ways of dealing with freaks like you"". And she'd also always go ""How am I supposed to explain you to my friends and relatives? What will they think?"" Bitch, how about what I think? 

The irony is that she's a hardcore misogynist because she kept saying she'd be fine with me being gay (She befriended gay men and had a gay adopted brother) but could not accept me as a female, as a daughter. She kept bleating about how she had a son and nothing else. She was the kind of woman who cussed out other women on a daily basis, mind.

I always took pride in my appearance, being very naturally feminine looking (One of the things that motivated me to transition). One of her favourite threats was ""I'll cut your face/splash acid/boiling water/hot oil on your face, then we'll see how you feel"". And not just her. She'd train me to fear the world by saying it was full of horrible people who would disfigure, torture and rape me if I crossed them.

I should also mention, she hacked off my hair any time I ever tried to grow it, starting from about 5-6 years old. Rough cuts with a pair of scissors and a fist yanking at it. Buzzing it away with clumsy assaults with an electric razor that I swore at the time nicked my scalp. 

As I got older it became force or deception. She'd either threaten to disown, disfigure, kill or call the police on me and force me to have it cut brutally short. Either that or she'd claim she was bringing me to get a ""nice"" haircut only to quietly tell the barber to cut it all short and masculine. I had trauma over haircuts for years because of this psychotic bitch.

Clothing too. She became violent if I wore female clothing in front of her. For a time I even had to throw a hoodie and baggy pants on over my outfit and change outside. She was insane.

This is all over the place. I'm not supposed to be writing this now frankly, it's work hours, but I thought of her again and felt like puking.

She raised me to idolize her, and I did, but this is what she actually did to me, to break me. She did not fully succeed. I fully transitioned. I left with a friend, thankfully without violent incident. She passed away a few years after.

I was mentally scarred, had grown to be narcissistic, neurotic and violent like her, but am trying to heal. I no longer idolize her, and am glad for her death. I live with my friend now. A different life. A better life. I am myself. I have a career. It pays well. I am discovering more of myself every day, finding who I am. It feels like an accelerated second upbringing, while simultaneously serving as a professional working woman.

Things are okay now. I can be okay now. I have all the tools to be okay now. My mind isn't fully convinced, but it's getting there gradually, which is why I wrote this today. To help me continue to heal, hopefully. To convince my mind that yes, it is okay now.

I put this out here so I could tell myself ""The world, or at least someone in the world besides me and my friend knows that my mother was a horrible person. She can't keep pretending to be good. The truth is out there.""

My ex has undiagnosed DID, so if you don't know the terminology, I'll explain it quickly.

System: A word used to describe multiple people living inside one persons head.

Host: The body of the system, the original, real person.

Alter: A personality or character the person with DID's brain creates to cope with trauma. 

Innerworld: The world inside the hosts head, where the entire system lives and roams. Think about the movie ""Inside Out"". That's what it's like.

Outerworld: The real world outside the hosts head.

Switching: Alters swapping in and out of the host position, like a football team.

Fronting: Someone who is ""Fronting"" is the Alter who is currently in the hosts body. 

//

So here's the thing. At first, I had no doubts that he had DID. He's always shown symptoms of personality disorders & depressive episodes, so I figured it was legit. He's been medically diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Let me explain to you the lengths this shit goes.

He has been tested for Autism, DID (OSDD), Schizophrenia (including alleged psychosis episodes), Dyslexia, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, OCD. Failed every single one. No actual symptoms are shown. I remember hearing about a phone call with his psychiatrist where the doctor SPECIFICALLY flat out said, ""YOU DO NOT HAVE SCHIZOPHRENIA,"" and he got mad and hung up on the doctor. Then, he proceeded to complain about how the doctor ""has no idea what he's talking about"" and how he ""doesn't do his job."" This would be like his third psychiatrist. Same thing every time they test him, they tell him no, and he goes off looking for someone who will tell him what he wants to hear.

Now for a while I believed I had DID, and at this point in time, I'm not sure if I do, considering I've (host) been up front for a few months without interruption. Headspace has been dead silent. The thing that changed is that I went off all my meds, the same exact meds my ex is on.  Weaning off of all the zoloft, prozac, riddlin, adderall, sirtuline, lexapro, etc... it was hell, but those meds genuinely clogged up my brain. All the trauma I endured during the time I was on that cycle of meds just got pushed down. I didn't cry for 4 years straight. It numbs you out, makes you feel alone, less empathetic, and keeps you quiet. Once I was fully clean and got my medical ""green"" card, the DID went with all my bullshit. Of course, i had to deal with 5 years of medicated repressed trauma, but it was worth it. My concern is that he's just a hypochondriac who's experiencing the same thing I did. 

DID TALK:


So, he claimed to have disabled alters. He said that he NEEDS and INSISTS on having mobility aids and that It's a luxury he truly wants for himself and his system. However, what he forgets to remember is that DID is mental. NOT PHYSICAL. It does not matter if an alter is disabled. If they are fronting in the hosts body, a FULLY ABLED BODY PERSON, you do not suddenly become a paraplegic when ""Dave"" fronts. It's basically like someone elses brain gets put into your body. If the person who owns the brain gets their arm chopped off, that doesn't mean the next body the brain gets put into, won't have arm mobility.

He also had a reoccurring ""wrist fracture"" from like 2018 that he brings up whenever he doesn't want to do anything and uses that as an excuse to not do anything, literally ever. He's had X-rays done. He's fine.

//

Let me explain how ""Alters"" are formed with an example.

If Linda grew up without a father and ended up with severe childhood trauma because of it, and she has DID, her brain knows a father figure is what she needs most. So her brain picks out a father figure character she really resignates with, or her brain creates a father figure from scratch.

So, it's common sense- that no one would ever need a racist pedophile as an alter, correct? 

I noticed on his socials that his most recent alter was ""Dream"", from the DSMP. I asked him about it, and he confidently told me he had no idea who Dream was and that he's never watched him before. He lied directly to my face.

How the fuck your brain create something that it doesn't know exists you fucking glob of mayonnaise. 

Then he tried to blame it on his other alters, but once again, that's not how DID works. Alters are formed based around your trauma responses & your neurological deprivation, not OTHER alters. It's the HOSTS disorder, not the alters.

I let it be and figured, ""You know what, whatever, I don't really give a shit"". So I started distancing myself.

BUT THEN HE OFFERED ME A TICKET TO BUSH GARDENS AND IT ONLY GOT WORSE

He hyped me all up, saying we were gonna be there all day and do all the rides. I had family plans that weekend but canceled it for him.

The night before, I told him not to drink any ""special shit"" because he wouldn't wanna be hungover the next morning. He didn't listen and did it anyway. Drank MY vodka.

So, we wake up early, and he refuses to eat or drink anything and insists on eating at the park because he ""didn't feel like it"".

I told him to bring his comfortable shoes since we will be walking all day. He picked his too small converse with holes in them. 

There was a ticketing issue that ended up with his grandmother having to pay around an extra $100. He complained about it taking so long to walk from the car to the entrance. Then about the walk from the entrance to the gates, then from the gates to the map, then to the first ride, and it KEPT GOING.

""My feet hurt"" ""My back hurts"" ""My ankle hurts"" ""My knees hurt"" ""How much longer till we get there"" ""no it's this way"" ""this way"".

He got us lost twice because he INSISTED on going the wrong way.

So we did the rapids twice, then cheetah hunt. Then he wanted to walk ALL THE WAY to the other side of the park, the little kid park, sesame street. I told him they wouldn't let us on anything because we were too big. He insisted on us going anyways. A 25 minute walk later and a whole fuck ton of ""MYYY FEEEEET HUUURTTTS""... we get there, and of course, like I said, we were too big. Now, we had to walk ALL the way back because I had to practically beg him to go on another ride. I couldn't just split up with him because he's the type of person to say ""yeah it's okay, go ahead,"" and then silently resent you for it for the next 10 years. He then starts complaining about his stomach hurting, and him being lightheaded. 

Shocker, he refused to drink or eat anything.

I filled up a water bottle for him and then I told him I wanted to go on sheikra. We went on and things were fine, but the second he got off the complaining starts again.

We got there around 12 and planned to stay until 9, it was now 2:50 when we got into the dragon cafe.

He finally wanted to eat something, so we sat down and everyone ate, but then now that he ate something, his stomach is upset and he refuses to go on any more rides or let me go on any more, except for the rapids.

So we start walking back to the rapids, and there was a line, and this family of 6 made it there before us. They didn't cut us, they were just closer. My ex goes ""UGH FUXKING MEXICANS"".... My birth father is mexican. I just kinda looked at him like ""dudeeee what? Like fr?"". He then got all huffy, and we stood in line for about 20 minutes before he decided that he didn't want to stand in line anymore. So right before we get on the ride, he drags me out to a park bench. At that point it was like 3:30 and calls his grandma and told him that WE BOTH wanted to leave NOW. His grandma & her boyfriend were off doing their own thing, enjoying their day. My ex forced them to meet us at the car to leave, but it didn't end there. 

As we were walking out, there was a group of 4 teens, 3 white boys, and a mixed boy (darkskin). One of the white boys went ""Dude I wanna go see the monkeys, you know? The primapes in the zoo. "" (For those who don't know, bush gardens is also a zoo).

My ex gives me this look, and goes, ""I really wanna say something, but I know you'll be mad at me."" I knew exactly what he was going to say, and I honestly didn't believe it actually came out of his mouth. 

I turned to him and kinda stood my ground, like ""no tell me, like, what's so funny?""

And he goes ""well you know they're looking for monkeys when, like, there's one like- right- pfft. "" Basically, calling the mixed boy a monkey.

At that point I just kinda shut the fuck up and didn't speak for once. I'd like to mention the entire time was also full of ""fuck you"" ""what the fuck are you doing"" ""you bitch"" and all that shit. So I just stopped.
My ex was also someone who vaped and developed a nicotine addiction fairly quickly. His brother was his dealer but his brother basically moved away so he was out. We saw a guy as we were leaving with one, AND MY EX TRIED TO COAX ME INTO GIVING THAT MAN A $50 BILL FOR A HALF USED FUCKING VAPE FOR HIMSELF. 

I was so pissed, but I shut up. We got in the car, drove off, and I stayed silent the entire time until his grandma asked why we came all this way only to stay for like 3 hours. My ex started saying ""well we just got bored and-"" and then I cut him off and went ""For the record, I didn't want to leave, HE wanted to. I was perfectly fine with staying, but you guys are my ride, so it's not like there's really anything I can do about it"".
Thank god this person is no longer in my life, and that only scratches the surface of the bullshit I tolerated from this absolute shitbag of toenail clippings.
My father is actually physically disabled, both my best friends dads are physically disabled, my best friend is disabled, and they all have REAL fucking struggles. Meanwhile my ex put shit in his bio like ""Handicapped"" or ""Disabled"" when they are perfectly fucking fine. The only physical health issue they have is fucking high cholesterol.

21,I hate tech bros and entrepreneurs,11w91j8,"I really and truly think that so many tech bros and entrepreneurs are so obsessed with profits and making a name for themselves that they don‚Äôt stop and think about the ethics or potential negative effects of the technologies they develop. I swear they must have some kind of fucking brain fungus that inhibits their ability to think about anything other than their own wallets.

Every time some fancy new technology starts making its way out of Silicon Valley into actual real-world use, it seems to have some kind of negative effect on a group of people that didn‚Äôt really have much going for them in the first place. When facial recognition started getting big, it was quickly adopted by authoritarian regimes like China who used it to clamp down on their citizens‚Äô privacy and human rights even more. When AI models like Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT became usable, the first industries they disrupted and filled with shitty machine-generated content were art and writing ‚Äì you know, the two industries that are notoriously low-paying and difficult to make it in. Now online art boards are getting filled with AI-generated shit, and garbage ‚Äúpoems‚Äù and stories written by ChatGPT are flooding out actual submissions to literary magazines and eBook websites by pathetic losers who want to get rich without contributing anything to society. All these people are getting fucked in the ass just so some assholes can get paid 300k to live in Sunnyvale.

Even worse is that these shitheads are so self-aggrandizing and ignorant that they think the arts are genuinely useless and unproductive, both to society at large and to people on an individual level. So whenever someone expresses concerns about this to them or their brain dead sycophants, they roll their eyes and say those folk should‚Äôve gone to college like them, or gotten a million-dollar loan from their parents to start their own tech startup so that they, too, could make enabling autocratic regimes and stealing peoples‚Äô jobs a full-time career.

These tech bros like to talk about how their AI models, once they achieve AGI, can solve various social and economic problems, creating a utopian society where nobody has to work and we can all spend our days pursuing what we really love. With the way tech bros‚Äô brains work, we won‚Äôt have a utopia, ever. They‚Äôll sell their AI models to malevolent corporations, causing their profit margins to absolutely skyrocket as their human workforce goes unemployed. They‚Äôll make bank off the rest of society going to shit. They only think about themselves.",daisyfaunn,1,2,1.0

These guidelines are given and they're said to be final. But if you look a little into it or you like try to find the studies that are based off these things that are being called facts, then discrepancy starts the show.

And then you think about genetics and all that, and I've come to the idea that, the only way I'm going to know which diet will be best for me, in the long run, is through experimentation and patience; and going and getting blood work once in awhile.

So many people follow the instructions of these authorities (governments, doctors, suspiciously funded scientists) given to them and then they still die painful deaths. They still don't live past 60 years old. I want to make it to at least 90 for freak sakes.

And I'm all for extreme measures, but how can anybody call a vegan diet or a keto/carnivore diet complete when you have to supplement with pills?

I want to hold fast to the idea that I can just eat all the nutrients that I need. And I don't really believe that I need to be hitting my macros every single week. So even if the foods that I buy from the grocery store are not the most nutrient dense prouduce, I feel like I will be okay.

I just wish I had some sort of baseline to jump from, instead of having to rely on anecdotal evidence, because I'm trusting these authorities less and less.

I think for now, all I can do, on my food journey, is be patient and experiment. Even maybe do an elimination diet down the line, because I do have allergies and a pretty basic immune system.

23,Guy I ghosted got into a relationship with another girl and I'm jealous about it,11w8pp5,"To start off, I know I'm going to get a lot of flack for this, and that's understandable. Last summer/fall, I (24 F) was dating this guy (22 M) for a bit. I found him INCREDIBLY attractive and he was constantly asking me out on dates and inviting me over to cook for me. I honestly thought he was pretty out of my league, looks-wise but he seemed interested in me. We had a fair bit in common but out conversations always felt quit boring to me. He was a little socially awkward but a very sweet guy. I was going through a lot in my personal life and eventually stopped seeing him around the end of November. He asked me out on another date and I ghosted. I then messaged him a few weeks later and he just didn't seem interested in talking to me, which is understandable... I could have communicated better. 

We continued to follow each other on social media but never followed each other on IG. Today, I randomly came across his IG and see that he's in a fresh relationship with a girl who I also think he is out of her league. This made me feel pretty jealous, not going to lie. 

I know that had I not been so immature, we may have ended up together, but I just wasn't ready for a relationship at the time because I had just gotten out of a four year relationship. I do truly hope they are happy together as he was a genuinely nice guy with a lot of passion and talent, and I have zero intentions of trying to contact him at all.

The next morning, I opened the fridge and was hit by an EXTREMELY strong smell of garlic, it was so strong that I could smell it from the other end of the room even after I'd closed the fridge door. Typically garlic smells good to me, but in that amount, it smelled as if my nose was up someone's sweaty armpits 24/7. I ended up tossing away the whole box because the stench was making me feel sick. It has been about 12h and my fridge still smells like sweaty armpits, and even my overnight oats smell bad.

I could fill a fucking book with how such dumbasses our customers are. A good 90% are just smart enough to know they can do their own work cheaper, but not smart enough to really understand what they're doing. This includes shops. Honestly some of the biggest dumbassery are from places that absolutely should know better or put down the tools and find something else to do.

So you have a pod style oil filter right? Sometimes shit leaks around there. It happens. One shop we deal with are absolute dumbasses and kept me on the phone for 20 minutes trying to describe the the gasket that seals it. They must have smoked their daily ration of crack 5 minutes before calling me. Then had the nerve to wonder why we don't have the gasket in stock for them. You know why we don't? Because anyone worth their shit is going to put back in a USED FUCKING OIL FILTER you hillbilly fuck. 

Then shops we already give discounts to will call asking for more. No, fuck you, I already know you're going to charge your customer full tilt on our part, so hop of my fuckin dick trying to penny pinch. Get good or sell your shop.

Same fucking shops will then bitch that we only gave a partial refund on a part we had to order from bumfuck nowhere, paid shipping cost on, had to draw a fucking pentagram to summon, then bring out to your shop in the fuckin hills 2 days after you ordered it. ""Uhhhhh uhhhhhh uuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhg its the wrooooong part"" no it isn't you incest baby fuck, I confirmed with you 5 times sent you 42069 pictures of the shit, and then you signed the fuckin invoice stating it had a restock fee.

I used to try really hard with regular ass retail customers, I can't blame them for not knowing much. Its not like they make their living doing the shit, they're just trying to save a few bucks and I'm on the same wave length. Well, that was a fucking mistake.

As you know I also speak dumbass and know what your ass backwards brain means when you tried putting a thought together so hard you malfunctioned and just approached me with the dumbest shit. Yes, if you can keep describing how its near a hose, or maybe a wire, you think it could be a gasket, really helps narrow it down üòÄ I'm sure you're going to stay up here for 45 minutes without realizing maybe if you had looked at it a third of the time that you've spent spewing the most brain dead shit at my desk you would have already gotten the price and did the ""uhhhh uhhhhhhhhhhhh uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I'm gonna have to thiiiiiink about it"" without having a second though that maybe our prices are high because we somehow have to make money when someone spends 45 minutes deciphering dumbass into coherent thoughts on a daily basis.

Customers are fucking liars. ""I called last night and they said it was $300 why is it $600 now?????"" Well when did you call? Oh? 7:30?

It's ruined my life because I can't comprehend what it is now, I always feel too young. Did society want me to just sleep around first? Pathetic. That's why there's so many single parents. You aren't too young for love. You need love early, so that by the time you have health issues there is someone that knows you so well and is willing to help you (motivate you to survive?), that you aren't alone and afraid. and trying to sleep with everyone you meet by the age of 25.",basicassusername30,1,1,1.0
36,Having an ‚Äòabnormal‚Äô sleep pattern isn‚Äôt great for my social life,11vzxrx,"I‚Äôm an early riser. Have been since I was born. Everyday until the at of 15 I used to naturally wake up at 6 am. It was very comfortable.

At 15 I started developed a more typical sleep routine for a teenager. Late nights and late mornings. Not at 19 I‚Äôve started getting desperately tired at 10pm and going to sleep. That‚Äôs when everyone starts socialising and it‚Äôs a struggle.

Do I mess up my sleep for socialising or do I mess up my socialising for sleep. It‚Äôs unfair. I also get woken up but unless it‚Äôs after midnight I won‚Äôt complain.",Nyx203,0,2,1.0
37,"You don‚Äôt care about the current issue, you just want brownie points.",11vzvdo,"A lot of y‚Äôall think that the current issue is some kind of aesthetic and just run with it for the current time, not because you genuinely care.

I remember in 2020 during the BLM protests there were black squares all over Instagram. Like what is that gonna do? Un-kill all the victims of gun violence? All it did was block useful information under hashtags for people who actually wanted to help, not lazy fucks who changed their pfp to a logo and called it a day. It‚Äôs only repeated from there.

I don‚Äôt know what was in the air during the pandemic (other than the rona) but y‚Äôall weird.",vercywercy,1,6,1.0
