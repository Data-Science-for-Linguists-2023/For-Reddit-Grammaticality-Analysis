I'd prefer to keep the specialty to myself, it's small, and I don't want to be doxxed (again). Our group (6 of us) went through some upheaval a few years ago when we were approached by the local hospital about being bought out and then the deal fell apart causing all sorts of issues in the practice. Well, the deal seems to have resurrected itself, and the hospital is again interested in acquiring the group. I don't really want to work directly for the hospital.

Coincidentally, the nearby Veteran's Affairs hospital is looking for someone in my specialty. I would take a pay cut, but they also apparently give you 10 weeks of paid time off, which is more than twice what I normally take off each year. I thought I might work another 5-10 years, but 10 weeks paid time off each year might mean I would work longer. 

I would be very interested in hearing about what employment is like at the VA. Also, I understand you can relocate to another VA hospital that has an open position fairly easily?",eric-incognito,4,6,0.81
6,Sublingual Dexmedetomidine in Psych,11vkxq1,"Background: am 7-on-7-off overnight pharmacist for small community independent hospital that recently added SL Precedex to formulary. Unfortunately, P&T meeting and addition to formulary was on the same morning as my week was ending so I wasn't able to ask as many questions as I would like beyond a generic short-form summary I received about PK, dosing, and restrictions currently to inpatient Psych.

Looking further into the data, seems like it was only approved for acute agitation in Schizophrenia or Bipolar but has a dissolution time of 6-8 mins ? and cannot be handled by nursing except for opening medication packet, so patients must self-administer.

We do not have Psych in-house overnight but rather tele-psych with only nurses in the unit; so seems like questions will come to me about it but I do not have any experience past literature.

Wanted to get any real-life use scenarios or data from psych RNs, pharmacists, MDs/DOs, NPs/PAs that have used this and would this actually be a feasible option versus something more actue like IM Haloperidol or Lorazepam as it is no longer on backorder ?

8,Teplizumab: A very exciting monoclonal antibody treatment for Type 1 Diabetes that was recently FDA approved.,11uz0mx,"Would love to start a discussion/raise awareness for emerging treatments in biologics for T1D. Teplizumab targets the auto reactive T-effector cells that attack the insulin producing Beta Cells of the pancreas. Several studies over the last 10 years have been done (Study 1, AbATE, Delay, PROTEGE, TN10) and it's was approved by the FDA last November.

The TN10 study which lead to FDA approval was geared mostly towards relatives of type 1 diabetics who had positive auto-antibodies but were not overtly hyperglycemic (Stage 2). It can only stop destruction of cells further, which is why it is usually only used in earlier stages.

I have personal experience with a family member receiving it at the time of clinical diagnosis who has shown marked improvement. I am fortunate to be in an unrelated medical field which gave me some foundation of knowledge to discover the availability of this new therapy. Some had considered him to be Stage 3 since he was started on insulin at diagnosis. However, since he still had a significant C-peptide measurement, it seemed prudent to pursue any option to preserve Beta Cell mass. It seems to me the old classification of Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 is outdated. T1D progression is a continuum of gradual loss of Beta Cell mass and corresponding decrease in C-peptide.

I have been incredibly impressed by the results and many people seem to be unaware of it, so I wanted to start this discussion to bring more awareness to the medication and discuss whether the staging guidelines are too restrictive, and whether this should be started as a standard treatment upon initial diagnosis to maintain as much insulin-producing capability as possible. In this particular case the patient experienced some amazing results:

Prior to therapy: C-Peptide 1.11 (STIMULATED), A1C 7.9, Insulin 7u/day, Average Daily Blood Sugar 140 eating a reduced carb load

1 Month After therapy: C-Peptide 0.7 (FASTING), A1C 5.9, Insulin 0u, Average Daily Blood Sugar 95 eating a normal carb load

The improvement was much more dramatic than expected. I should say that there currently is a trial ongoing for ""Stage 3"" T1 diabetics to receive Teplizumab as well as a study to receive a second dose after 2-3 years. I have read just about every study on Teplizumab so I am happy to answer any questions on the treatment protocol, expected outcomes, side effects, mechanism of action or really anything you can think of.

24,"Loma Linda University is attempting to halt resident unionization with a counterclaim that residents are students not employees, and therefore can not unionize. An additional claim that their status as a religious organization should preclude them from unions.",11st9rs,"There has been a wave of unionization as well as the demonstrations of the potential power of unions in the healthcare sector. We've seen a torrent of residencies at large and small universities coming together to unionize and win meaningful changes in compensation and quality of life.  Simultaneously, we see nursing unions threatening to strike as well as following through to advance the causes of their members.  This is an important movement to pay attention to in the healthcare space as well as the broader scopes. 

In that light, I think it's crucial that we be aware of attempts to restrict the stratagems that have seen success in other locations.  Specifically the legal battle between Loma Linda University and the National Labor Relations Board in regards to their residents unionization.

To my knowledge they've made two claims as to why residents can not unionize.  Firstly, that they are students not employees.  Secondly, that Loma Linda is a religious organization and therefore not subject to the greater legal context surrounding unions.

I'm interested to hear from the greater medical community as to your thoughts on this specific issue, as well as the merits/drawbacks of unionization in the medical field.

I hope this becomes a wake-up call for changing policies in the future. The ED is not the place to be for midlevels IMO.

32,Dutch operating rooms shut down tomorrow: staff and hospitals at impasse,11s07uw,"[Dutch Original Article](https://nos.nl/artikel/2467547-operatiekamers-liggen-morgen-stil-personeel-en-ziekenhuizen-in-impasse)

Operating theatres in 64 hospitals will shut down tomorrow for scheduled care due to actions for a better collective agreement. Only emergency care will be provided then. The unions and employers' organisation NVZ are at a stubborn impasse in their dispute over wage increases. Do the actions make sense and why does no solution seem to be at hand? Four questions and answers.

**Are hospitals prepared to consider a pay rise?**

Hospital umbrella organisation NVZ agrees with the unions that hospital staff deserve better pay. Currently on the table is a 13 per cent pay rise offer, spread over two years: 5 per cent now, 5 per cent at the end of this year and another 3 per cent in 2024.

For the unions, this offer is not good enough. ""In itself, the 10 per cent increase for this year is nice,"" says FNV executive Elise Merlijn. ""It is just not enough that this increase is spread over the year. We need an income improvement for staff now. People won't make it otherwise. And with that 3 per cent added in 2024, you won't compensate inflation properly then.""

**Why don't hospitals want to implement the 2023 pay rise all at once?**

Some hospitals are not financially strong enough to increase spending by millions in one fell swoop. Medium-sized and small hospitals in particular are not in a position to bear such a burden, according to consultants such as BDO and KPMG.

Because other costs have also risen sharply, partly due to the war in Ukraine. ""We also face higher procurement costs, high inflation and high energy costs,"" says Marjolein Tasche, chairman of the board of Franciscus Gasthuis and Vlietland.

On top of that, the hospitals have promised large investments to healthcare minister Kuipers. These are needed to reform the healthcare system under the recently concluded Integral Care Agreement. Combined with an additional increase in salaries, it does become very tight.

It is ""a diabolical dilemma"", says Tasche, who is also vice chairman of healthcare employers' organisation NVZ. ""We can only spend our money once. And we also want to invest in new equipment and training for our people to be ready for digital care and innovations.""

**Are staff only campaigning for more pay or is there more to it?**

Salary levels play an important role. High inflation has made it even harder to make ends meet. This certainly applies to the starting salary for a qualified nurse at MBO level of around 2,300 euros gross per month. The average salary for this profession, over 3,400 euros gross, is also not always sufficient, according to the unions.

A specialised college-level nurse can earn over 4300 euros a month. But money is not the only thing that matters. As a profession, nurses are an important foundation of hospitals, but they feel they have too little say, for instance in the distribution of shifts.

Since the corona pandemic, staff shortages in healthcare have increased sharply, leading healthcare workers to work extra shifts more often. Hospitals want to cut allowances for this.

""So there is not much in return for the flexibility that hospital managements find so important,"" says Marlies Kraak, specialist nurse at the Franciscus Gasthuis and Vlietland in Rotterdam and Schiedam. ""This does make it very unattractive to work in healthcare. If you have to work nights, weekends and holidays. but there is no remuneration in return.""

A vicious circle is the result, says Kraak. More people leave while fewer come back for them. The workload will only increase. ""A better wage is then the least you can do. And perhaps a first step on breaking that downward spiral.""

**Is an end to the impasse in sight?**

Probably not. The NVZ insists that a 10 per cent pay rise all at once is too much. According to the umbrella organisation, it is possible to break the deadlock if the Ministry of Health (VWS) and health insurers step in financially. However, these have indicated that they are not willing to do so. Hospitals already receive substantial amounts from the government because labour costs are indexed. VWS currently considers this sufficient.

According to NVZ chairman Ad Melkert, the survival of the Integral Care Agreement is at risk if wages go up by 10 per cent all at once and hospitals do not receive additional money.

FNV leader Merlijn argues that investments in new buildings and equipment can wait. ""Now choose your people and invest in them. Ultimately, they are the ones at the bedside doing the work. Without them, the implementation of healthcare agreement will really be on its hiatus.""

If the NVZ will not move, the unions will enter into consultations with the workers about multiple days of action involving emergency care only. ""And then we will probably take action in even more hospitals,"" he said.

Who else sympathises with Joel to the point that killing everyone at the end to halt Ellie's surgery? 

Both media represent Joel's arc as something of seeing a chance to save his new adopted daughter at the expense of the greater good after losing his biological one by a soldier containing a pandemic zealously. 

Coming from a medical point of view, I don't consider Joel's stance that ambiguous.

1. The idea of curing the fungus at this point seems ludicrous. The countless zombies are husks. The remaining humans are presented as the overwhelming danger in this universe. 

2. Ellie did not give anything close to proper consent. They could have simply asked her, she was a mature minor. If Joel knew she wanted it and they let it sit for a bit, murder rampage may have been abstained.

3. We all know that their understanding of Ellie's immunity to the fungus is probably poor. They had lots of recourse to study her blood, work out why she is resistant. Simply chopping her brain out and trying to get the next stages to work seems like a level of futility.

4. OK so they need her brain, so take some of her brain. Marlene presents it very much as Ellie is going to die for the greater good. Ummmm you guys can take some cortex, get a needle biopsy. I'm sure Ellie and Joel may have been open to the possibility of disability and risk of death to get this done so to speak. 

In my way of thinking here are some quacks that haven't given me any information about to do a shitty science experiment governed by doctors who could be nuts, out of their sub speciality etc.

Case in point. I was taking care of an elderly lady with moderate to advanced stage COPD, for weakness. On LAMA-ICS. Reports she had diarrhea a few days ago, and started getting weak. Mild sore throat; she thought it was thrush from the ICS. Vital signs were obtained. She had a cough, with thick, yellow sputum. She does have a history of COPD exacerbations in the past. Slightly hypotensive (high 80s/low 50s). Pulse normal. No fever. No shortness of breath. No wheezing. Physical exam as follows: Pallor noted on skin. No rales on auscultation; decreased breath sounds, nothing out of the ordinary given patient's COPD. S1, S2, no murmurs. No peripheral edema.

I’ve toyed with fellowship ideas, but for a variety of reasons—some well thought out and others not—I recoil at the idea of more specialization. 

I do really enjoy endoscopy, and the rural general surgeons we rotate with do lots of screening and diagnostic work, as well as some basic interventional stuff (dilation, foreign body removal, etc). But, advanced surgical endoscopy seems to have exploded. So many applications in the resource-limited setting could supplement small hospitals where IR and interventional GI aren’t available.

I’ve briefly looked into training programs, but it seems few are intended for surgeons. Cleveland Clinic, Weill Cornell, and Jackson Health are some I’ve come across. The training would be excellent, but I wonder how much could be learned through industry, especially for a community surgeon looking to support a bread-and-butter practice?

Some low-lights:

* Page 2: ""At the very least, any rule that the FTC finalizes must specifically exempt physicians and senior hospital executives or, more generally, highly-skilled, highly-compensated employees...""
* Page 4: Argues that the FTC cannot retroactively ban existing non-competes, arguing that ""employers have *already* performed their duty under the contract by hiring the employee; the employee, by contrast, still has not completed her duty to abide by the non-compete agreement."" In other words, the employer fulfills their contractual duty at the moment of hiring, whereas the employee's duties exist in essential perpetuity until the employer decides otherwise.
* Page 6 discusses existing regulations on non-competes. Notice how the earlier paragraphs mention physicians and senior level executives, but henceforth they seem to be focusing only on physicians. Why is that?
* Page 7: ""the weight of the existing research indicates that non-compete agreements for certain categories of employees are beneficial – namely, doctors and senior hospital executives. This is exactly the experience of the AHA’s member hospitals and health systems. "" Bullshit meter rising..
* Page 8: Cites some pretty weak evidence from an Ohio State researcher which I'll discuss in a separate post.
* Page 10-11: ""*First*, non-compete agreements are valuable tools for protecting investments that hospitals make to recruit doctors and senior executives."" Discusses how difficulty recruiting patients in rural areas limits access to care-- neglecting the fact that doctors may not want to work in a hospital with a noncompete, thereby restricting the available recruiting pool. Weakass argument.
* Page 12: ""*Second*, non-compete agreements encourage hospitals and health systems to make investments in training their employees. While much of a physician’s training occurs in medical school and residency, doctors must stay current with scientific developments and innovation."" So without non-competes, hospitals won't care if their doctors are up to date? That's a failing of the hospital, not of banning non-competes. Also cites a study that seems to be focused on executives, not physicians.
* Page 13: ""*Third*, non-competes encourage the sharing of proprietary information within hospitals and health systems. "" What-the-what? Trying to make the argument that innovation is promoted by restricting access, which is anathema to public knowledge, which forms the basis of medicine.
* Page 15: Ah, the crux of the argument.

We are carrying on, carrying one another and trying to get all of the patients, mine and hers, cared for in a compassionate way.

Many of her patients are also taking it hard. Our days are filled with addressing the grief of the patients while still grieving ourselves. That said, there has also become a problem with groups of patients who have demanded to know the details of her illness. I do tell them she had a malignancy  that was so bad that it could not be treated to save her life. (true). Many patients press for more and it makes me very uncomfortable Beyond that, there are rumors that she took her own life. Some even insist I am making up a story to cover this. 

I am grieving. My staff is grieving. We are trying to handle all of this with grace. I am not looking for advice. 

But my advice to patients has changed and I do want to share it. Remember that life is vanishingly short, Nobody knows how many minutes they have. Make your minutes count.

69,Disillusion in medicine - being satisfied regardless ?,11n2osa,"Disclaimer: this post is meant more like a discussion, feel free to share your thoughts and experiences, I don't expect a factual answer.

A lot of people get disillusioned with medicine during med school/residency/attendinghood. I get that a lot of people had unrealistic expectations of medicine, often thinking it's way more exciting and dramatic than it is really. But really, I feel like even if you know it's not often exciting, there's a lot of paperwork and bla bla, it's still one of the most beautiful careers there is. You are helping people, even if it is boring paperwork. Even if they're angry at you and it's often a thankless job. Even if you're just stabilizing a patient that has so many issues that they will inevitably come back to the hospital in a few weeks. I get that it can be frustrating, but all of this should be expected, imo before you commit to medicine you should read up a little on the subject, and still want to do that regardless. Sometimes I'm kind of confused as to why people get so disappointed about this specific aspect of medicine (it being more boring and paperwork oriented, very often not actually saving people). Having been to nursing school before, I remember how much paperwork it was, but somehow I still liked it. I didn't expect drama and movie-like scenarios, I just enjoyed reminding myself each time that what I was doing was helping people, no matter how boring it was sometimes. Also, there was the occasional exciting save too so there's that.

About midlevel issues, litigation anxiety etc., I feel like these are obviously important issues, but every job must have its problems, no? I feel like people always think the grass is greener elsewhere.

Of course, there are some issues that I feel are way more significant as there is sometimes no way around them, like the culture of overworking, the social pressure, the working conditions, which I think shouldn't be part of medicine in an ideal world.

At the end of the day though, a job is a job, it's not meant to be as exciting or relaxing as your hobbies and stuff like that, it's kind of to be expected that it's hard work and not that exciting, but the fact remains that most of the things we do are to help people in a way, even if it's boring.

89,Medicine and AI- my thoughts,11k0fc9,"I’ve seen a lot of threads about AI lately and have spent some time recently thinking and learning about it. 

One mind numbing fact is that the doubling time of AI is currently 3.4 months and shortening. Imagine if your 401k doubled every 3.4 months. It’s difficult for the human brain to comprehend this type of exponential growth. 

What we’re seeing right now with Chat GPT is like the early days of computers that still used punched out pieces of paper to run calculations. Simply put its child play. 

My hot take: I think in the next 1-2 years we’ll start seeing AI integrated in our EHR. It’s already being used in research but I think we’ll see it on the clinical side very soon. Initially it will be for small things, subtle and probably welcomed to help with cognitive load and complex patients. Epic pop-ups will actually start being helpful. It will gradually become a more and more integral part of medicine and those with less experience and training will benefit the most. 

I think in 10 years or less it will be everywhere and determine treatment/ management plans for most patients. Risk calculators based on millions of data points will determine disposition, which floor the patient needs, medications etc. 

Eventually, in 10-15 years I think AI will impact medicine as a career. Those with less training and experience will just need to lean on AI and be “good enough” to replace most physicians. This will be welcomed by insurance companies and hospital systems. Non-procedure specialties will be hit the hardest initially. Eventually in 25+ years we will all be replaced by a robot/nurse/AI hybrid.

Not trying to stir up fear and controversy but it’s an interesting topic that we need to start thinking about. I do think it will happen a lot faster than we think and will hurt physicians a lot more than we think.",KetamineBolus,130,77,0.78

He had taken 15 mg every single day for multiple months and stopped his prednisone (Prescribed in case of a giant cell arteritis). The man did not speak any of our languages and always had a cousin with him when he went to his doctor to translate, but to be honest, the cousin also barely spoke the language.

We arranged a translator in the hospital to properly explain his meds, but his first physician works in a private practice where it is very difficult to get a translator.

Though I firmly believe cases like this is the exact reason why you should always learn the language of the country you move to, I feel like it is still our responsibility to make sure the patient properly understands how to take his meds, even if they do not know the language.

2) How hard is to process non radiological data like heart murmurs, visible body anomalies like ulcers, grading of pain, dyspnea, fatigue into well set parameters to be fed into a machine.

3) Since the software can be centralized, shouldn't deployment of various AI modalities be widespread since only input devices will be required for investigations and the output will be generated after cloud processing. 

4) How far are we from solving data aggregation problems like noise reduction, input heterogenity and labeling bias?

98,Cell phones and psychiatric units,11ir0mc,"I hadn't seen much on this topic so curious what the general consensus is out there on how facilities and individuals deal with this. The cell phone has become an integral part of our lives, scheduling, messaging, social media, etc. I know some places have a blanket ban on cell phones in psych units, others dependent on good behavior, maybe some who allow it. Some of the issues tend to be that phones have cameras and can take pictures of other patients, post on the internet, etc. Contact with others may be undesirable depending on their circumstances. The glass or phone could be used as a weapon, distraction from therapies, and need to remove the patient from the environment that led to their admission. However, it can make it feel punitive and prison-like and also impede making appointments and keeping in contact with friends/family, and possibly you want to see how the patient responds with their usual stressors.

102,Psychotherapy notes as part of EHR,11hst6v,"Part of my old job sometimes involved a chart review of a pt's history within the health system.

It really bothered me that psychotherapy notes were included in the chart review. Therapy involves trusting a therapist enough to discuss trauma, and those disclosures shouldn't be available to any clinician (nurse, doctor, whoever) performing a chart review. I also doubt that those patients realized that the information they shared would be easily viewable by any clinician within that health system looking through the patient's history.

This is on my mind lately as I'm helping someone navigate finding a therapist they can feel comfortable with.

My question is, how does your system handle this? Is there a way to block psychotherapy notes from non-psychologists in the system? If this is a concern, is the only option to see a private, independent psychologist?

I realize that many clinicians don't have the time to perform such a thorough review of the record anyway, but that's beside the point, which is helping to ensure an environment of trust between the patient and therapist, and respecting the very private nature of these sessions.",pernambuco,65,96,0.93

These claims often rely on the fact that the weight is regained over some time. This fuels despair while wreaking havoc on feelings of self-efficacy in the weight loss community (thus discouraging behavioral change based on the health beliefs model). I’ve spoken to some overweight/obese individuals who refuse to even address their eating now because they’ve been repeatedly told that they are statistically unable to change their diet to lose weight. It’s a helpless and terrible feeling as a future healer.

I feel that this claim ignores the fact that diet often fulfills its initial goal of helping to lose weight (even if it’s gained back later). I’ve been therefore wondering if we should be referring to obesity as a “chronic remitting disease” instead of just a “chronic disease”. In this way - we could consider diet as an effective “acute” treatment and stop blaming it for the yo-yo. We could then turn our attention to a more reliable strategy for prevention of remission and empower our patients.

The anesthetic is desflurane.

\>NHS data suggests the gas, used to keep people unconscious during surgery, has a global warming potential 2,500 times greater than carbon dioxide.

\>Banning it in Scotland - from its peak use in 2017 - would cut emissions equal to powering 1,700 homes a year.

 \>In the last few years, more than 40 hospital trusts in England and a number of hospitals in Wales have stopped using it.

\>[**NHS England will introduce a similar ban**](https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/putting-anaesthetic-emissions-to-bed/) from 2024, which - like Scotland - prohibits its use for anything but exceptional circumstances.

 \>Dr Kenneth Barker, anaesthetist and clinical lead for Scotland's [**national green theatres programme**](https://www.nhscfsd.co.uk/our-work/national-green-theatres-programme/), said he was shocked to find the anaesthetic drug he had used for more than a decade for many major and routine operations was so harmful to the environment.

\>""I realised in 2017 that the amount of desflurane we used in a typical day's work as an anaesthetist resulted in emissions equivalent to me driving 670 miles that day,"" he said.

\>""I decided to stop using it straight away and many fellow anaesthetists have got on board.

Is this also a trend in the U.S.?  Are there any contraindications?  Would you agree with this law?  I have to admit some hesitance.  I have doubts about politicians banning anesthetics for non-health related reasons.

[This](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(23\)00434-8/fulltext) is the lead editorial in the March edition of The Lancet. What is the purpose of this in a journal about medicine? Not just a journal, but arguably The journal.

I understand that medicine doesn't exist in a vacuum from society. Social determinants of health have a massive impact on our patients and our ability to care for them. Public policy, both surrounding health care and more generally, has relevance to our jobs. But they don't even mention anywhere how this would impact public health around the world. There are a few sentences vaguely mentioning not addressing the World Bank's health-related projects, but they don't actually go into any detail regarding how the current leadership is negatively impacting public health globally, beyond it being neocolonial.

This seems like a minor gripe, a single 5 paragraph editorial in one journal is not corrupting medicine. I get that. But this feels straight up political to me. The authors clearly want to exert influence in this sector, and to me they haven't justified why this will benefit patients and public health. Over the last 3 years in particular we've had a crisis of faith in institutions, medicine and public health being amongst the most affected. The politicization of COVID and other issues has led to mistrust and outright dismissal of evidence-based medical guidance by large swathes of people. I simply don't think that continuing to throw ourselves in the mud of politics will help us get out of this mess, except when we are dealing with public policy issues that have a clear and demonstrable impact on our patients and our ability to care for them.

114,What are the best ways to treat hospital delirium?,11gstuu,"I know all the ways to prevent it- encourage out of bed activity, allow uninterrupted rest, maintain day/night rhythm, lights on and curtain open during the day, lights off at night, avoid deleriogenic meds, etc.

Unfortunately for many reasons those frequently don’t happen. Sometimes patients refuse, sometimes they need frequent monitoring/meds, sometimes orders don’t get updated to address improved status (changing q 4 vitals to q8 for example), sometimes policy and workflow cause problems (0400 labs). 

So delirium happens. Do we have any good ways to actually treat it? Often the prevention steps don’t work because the patient becomes so agitated and confused that they’re a risk to self or staff. They often get restrained or sedated to protect themselves/be able to continue medical treatment- but that of course worsens their delirium. 1:1 sitters, even the good ones, often don’t actually help to calm the patient or get them to sleep. Telling the patient “it’s midnight, time to sleep” or “it’s 7 am, let’s get up for breakfast” rarely actually gets them back to a regular sleep schedule in my experience.

Honestly I’ve not seen much at all work other than family presence (though sometimes they make it worse too by getting so upset at seeing their delirious loved one). What seems to happen is the patient gets wilder and wilder until they finally crash and sleep 12+ hours and then start to very slowly improve.

“Allow uninterrupted rest” doesn’t work when they’re pulling off oxygen and climbing out of bed every 20 minutes. “Encourage out of bed activity” isn’t safe when they’re too confused to follow instructions. 

So once delirium sets it, what should we be doing? How can we resolve the delirium but also keep the patient and staff safe and maintain medical treatment in the meantime?",zeatherz,69,98,0.98

Right out of residency I signed a two-year contract with a hospital, and as part of the compensation package I received a $40,000 signing bonus (as a check, before I ever worked a single shift) and a total of $60,000 in loan repayment (structured as two separate $30k repayments directly to the loan servicer, once at my one-year anniversary and another at my two-year anniversary).

This all seemed great, I am certainly making much more money as an attending than I ever made in residency. The taxes are hefty, but I managed to adjust my withholding so it wasn't too big of a shock when tax time came each year.

This year, however, my W2 showed my taxable wages as $100k higher than expected. When I reached out to payroll, they said that this represents the signing bonus as well as my loan repayment. I checked my agreement that I signed (with great excitement, as a new grad!) and lo and behold, it says that these amounts are taxable, AND that these taxes will all be due during the 2022 tax year.

My question for you is: has anyone had a similar situation?

I acknowledge that we as physicians make a good living, but I don't know many people that just have $30k sitting around to give to the government. I also acknowledge that technically I agreed to this when I signed the agreement, but it seems like a bad way to provide bonuses and loan repayment if a large lump sum will suddenly become taxable all at once. Obviously, I'm not a tax person, but a cursory search seems to indicate that employers should withhold taxes from both signing bonuses and loan repayments. Not sure if there's much that can be done at this point, but I'm seriously at a loss and have been quite stressed about how I'm going to come up with the money.

I’m a recent grad in my first attending job as an anesthesiologist. I struggled as a resident with the ineffectiveness of our system and an overwhelming sense of helplessness in the face of an administration that seemed to care more about the profits of a non-profit hospital than the well being of hospital employees and patients. 

I had hoped that life as an attending would be better, but I’ve run into many of the same problems as an attending in a new hospital. I tried utilizing the hospitals safety reporting system and ended up getting in trouble. 

I enjoy providing anesthesia for patients. I still find it to be rewarding particularly on the occasion a patient wakes up from sedation and immediately exclaims how dope it was. I enjoy my coworkers. I struggle with everything else. I feel angry and frustrated at work every day.

When the nurses were cutting off his clothes, his entire body was covered in infectious lesions & body lice, and his feet were both infected, bloody, and necrotic - also covered in insects. The smell was absolutely putrid. We ended up having to intubate this man as he could not protect his own airway. I will never forget seeing the pink foamy mixture of blood and mucus shoot out of his mouth throughout the entire series of compressions. The nurses & other personnel performing CPR had body lice crawling all over their clothes and in their hair. We tried to rewarm the man with IV fluids and the bear hugger, and ultimately ended up using ECMO in the trauma bay. After some time, we were able to warm him enough to achieve ROSC and then he was then transferred to the ICU, where he was basically determined to be braindead with a pulse. He stayed in the ICU for weeks and weeks until I imagine he was then transferred out to some long-term care facility. Time and time again, I see homeless people like this, barely alive and/or nearly frozen to death, taken into our ED only to be resuscitated in the most gruesome manner, to then either die in the trauma bay or be transferred elsewhere, barely “alive.” 

Can someone explain to me how this is more cost-effective than providing basic social safety nets and socialized healthcare?

I used to like (or rather have no strong feelings or opinion towards) personal protective equipment. Masks were a component of a reasonable set of guidelines in the context of surgery and isolation precautions. Surgical masks limited the likeliest transmissible pathogens in the perioperative setting without being overly cumbersome. When dealing with known cases of airborne disease, a higher degree of protection was implemented, i.e. N95s. In both situations, neither is, nor was intended to be, a perfect barrier to disease transmission (thus the “95” part). A degree of risk was permissible and that degree changed based on the situation.


Now? I don’t even know how to describe what’s going on. Masks havre morphed into a job requirement, another drink not to be left at the nurse’s station, and frankly a barrier to our humanity. I depend on my coworkers with lives at stake and *I don’t even know what they look like.* Comparisons to restrictive religious garb would not be unwarranted.


Masks used to be science. Now there’s politics, money, and fear mixed in. It’s a mess. I look forward to a time again when we wear masks because we need to wear masks.


Hooboy am I ready for a shitstorm of downvotes. I get that you don’t like being sick. No one does! You want to protect your patients. Me too! Life is not an inherently risk-free endeavor. Ad absurdum you could live your life in a bunny suit. The effects of universal surgical masking policy in healthcare settings on pathogenicity and overall outcomes will be hard to tease out and will take time to determine.


But this mask-cop, chin-strap, left-right-blue-red nonsense is just too much for me to handle. This work is so hard, so much of the humanity has been drained from our passion and calling, and mask-mania seems like one more of the thousand cuts we suffer.

164,Health insurance does not have anti-trust protection anymore,11bq7q6,"As you may know, a huge disadvantage in any attempt to curtail the health insurance insanity in the US is the inability to use the typical anti-trust statutes that can be applied to any other industry.

This has (supposedly) changed. 

The McCarran–Ferguson Act was something that the public learned about during the PP ACA debate, [and were occasionally surprised to learn that health insurance is exempt from anti-trust legislation.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091031063528/http://www.examiner.net/news/x1914248650/Health-insurance-companies-exempt-from-anti-trust-laws)

[Here was the debate in the house.](https://files.catbox.moe/lz83t0.mp4) 

Signed into law in January 2021. Maybe there was some other, more captivating news during that time that made people (myself included) not see this.

Here is what rep DeFazio said in the house. The transcript from CSPAN is not 100% correct, but it gets the point across. I noted where I changed things to more accurately reflect what was said in Italics.

His point on geographic redlining is well taken. Deeply seated grievances are being created right now that are not talked about. There are all sorts of justifications that could be used to say it's not necessarily a bad thing. Think about it for a minute, think of all the implications.  

It's not a surprise people do not trust healthcare, or medicine in general, if they view it as deeming them unworthy because of where they wake up and go to bed. People come to the beliefs they hold for a reason.


>I thank the gentlelady. This bill, h.r. 1418, has 51 co-sponsors in the house, 26 democrats, 25 republicans. It's endorsed by 23 national organizations, including consumer reports, who estimates it will save consumers billions of dollars a year in health insurance costs. Other consumer rights groups, american dental association, hospital association, and more. There are only two for-profit industries in america who have an exemption from antitrust law. One is professional baseball dating from the 1920's. And the other is the vital area of health insurance, dating to the 1940's. This amendment -- this bill will take away that exemption. What's that mean? Right now, insurance companies can and do get together and collude.

>Before covid, they'd go to some fancy resorts, get together and say, how about you stay out of north dakota, we'll stay out of south dakota. You stay out of oregon. You stay out of washington. You divide up the pie. You decide where you're selling. We'll decide where we're selling. ***Oh, and by the way, here's the things we don't want to cover. Here are the people we want to redline and exclude. That's legal, that's all legal!*** What does it do? It drives up the cost and the availability is diminished for americans. And now here we are midst covid. And the estimates are that five million people have lost their insurance during covid. Five million people. Yet, last year, the health insurance industry made an eye-popping $33 billion in profits. This year, the reports are they're doing even better with more and more people uninsured. How are they doing that? Well, they're jacking up co-pays. They're jacking up deductibles. They're excluding all sorts of treatments from coverage. And it's all legal and they can all get together and say, hey, if you won't cover this, we won't cover it. That way you won't lose customers. We won't lose customers. What a sweet deal. What a sweet deal. One in four americans hesitated to go to the doctor. Who was insured. People who were insured. Or to fill a prescription. Get needed treatment because of the extraordinary co-pays and high deductibles. So that's why people are paying $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 before they can get coverage on these so-called policies. What's this about? It's about greed. And it's time to end. 

>This is a vital service for the american people. You know, this bill was part of the original affordable care act in the house. My provision. It was stripped out in the senate. At the behest of a former insurance executive. Good old senate. So it didn't get into the final version of the a.c.a. They took out a lot of good things too. The house bill was way preferable with exchanges, not for profits, etc. In any case, it was stripped out. The house held another vote after the passage of the affordable care act in 2010. Tom pair yellow, then representative from virginia, offered up my bill on the floor, and it passed by 406-19. What kind of bills pass 409-19? Then my co-lead on the bill, representative gosar, he introduced the bill in 2017, and it passed 416-7. In the most bitterly partisan atmosphere in congress since post-civil war, 416-7. It's time to get this done. Finally, we're seeing some action in the senate. Senator leahy has introduced a bill. Chair of the judiciary committee. Of course -- I mean -- sorry, ranking member. And senator daines. So three democrats, three republicans on the bill. Hopefully, you know, the senate will see the wisdom in helping americans afford health insurance. Lowering their deductibles. Lowering their co-pays. Lowering their exclusions on prescription drugs. You know, even under medicare part d, they are always jacking people around. They say, oh, sorry, you can't have that medication anymore. We just took it off the list last week. They can do it anytime they want, and they can talk to the other insurers and say, hey, we're taking that drug off our list. Will you take it off your list? We don't want people to switch to your plan. That is legal. This will be a tremendous service to the american people. If at any time in history. But particularly now in times of covid and crisis. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. With that I yield back the balance of my time.

171,New Study Shows Aircraft Wastewater Surveillance Can Monitor SARS-CoV-2 Variants,11b3tir,"*A recent study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and biotech company Ginkgo Bioworks found that wastewater from aircrafts could be an effective tool for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants. The research showed that this testing could be done cheaply and easily, without disturbing passengers or airport operations.*

A new study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and biotech company Ginkgo Bioworks has shown that aircraft wastewater surveillance can be a useful and low-resource approach to monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants. The study found that the testing was easy and could be done cheaply, only adding about three extra minutes to aircraft maintenance times at airports. The authors of the study say that this approach could provide a complementary early warning system for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens of public health concern.

## The Study

The study was conducted in collaboration with Ginkgo Bioworks and tested wastewater samples from 80 international flights into New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport between August 1 and September 9, 2022. All flights originated from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France. The researchers collected and tested 65 airborne sewage samples, and 81 percent of the samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The rate of positive samples was the same among the three countries. The researchers were also able to get 27 genome sequences from 25 of the samples. All of the genomes revealed omicron sublineages, mostly BA.5 as well as BA.4.6 and BA.2.75.

## The Feasibility

The study demonstrated the feasibility of aircraft wastewater surveillance as a low-resource approach compared with individual testing to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants without direct traveler involvement or disruption to airport operations. According to the authors, the testing only added about three extra minutes to aircraft maintenance times at airports and didn't require hassling passengers with nose swabs or other sampling methods. The authors concluded that the testing could be easily scaled up as needed as the world largely abandons other SARS-CoV-2 testing and monitoring strategies.

## The Importance

The study adds to other evidence that airport and aircraft wastewater surveillance can play a role in monitoring the spread of pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. This method has already been used in various places around the country for monitoring early surges of COVID-19 as well as tracking the spread of polio in New York. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, viral shedding in feces can begin very early in an infection, potentially before a person has symptoms.

## Limitations

While the study has shown the effectiveness of aircraft wastewater surveillance, there are limitations to this method. It will be mostly helpful for longer flights, where people are more likely to use the lavatory. Additionally, it's unclear if all airlines will agree to the sampling. Lastly, because international travelers can have various connecting flights before arriving in the US, it might not be possible to track the origin of variants that arrive in the US.

## Conclusion

The study conducted by the CDC and Ginkgo Bioworks has demonstrated that aircraft wastewater surveillance can be an effective and low-resource approach to monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants. The authors say that this approach could provide a complementary early warning system for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens of public health concern.",aivonette,0,24,0.94

173,Pharmacist here venting about a call with a surgeon.,11alt4g,"For background, I am a central hospital pharmacist. I verify/edit/enter roughly 600-800 orders per an 8 hour shift for a hospital that has an average census of 350. We used MediTech.

I was processing orders entered by a colorectal surgeon (home med continuations), one of which was lisinopril. The patient's potassium from that morning was 5.7, and they also had IVFs running with potassium. So, I called the surgeon to see if the IVF could be changed/stopped and to hold the lisinopril.

I thought it was going to be a straightforward call. Immediately he says that he has already taken care of the IVF and that I must have been taking too many coffee breaks and my computer is ""slow"" for not recognizing it. I am confused because the IVF order is still very much active and I do not see any edits on it. There is a little bit of a lag between order entry and ""pharmacy land"" so I assume he may have just edited the order a few seconds ago, and I needed to refresh. I do so, and nothing has changed. He goes on to say that he has ordered it to be capped/locked, so that is when I leave the pharmacy processing side and go to the order entry side and can see that he has typed a nursing communication to lock the IVF about 20 mins prior, but had not actually discontinued the order. I see this and understand now what he meant, and offered to discontinue the IVF for him to which he replies no, I can't do that because he has already done so since locking it means it is discontinued.

Last week I had a patient who was medically ready to go for 7 days waiting on a charity IPR bed because good ol’ United Healthcare wouldn’t cover it despite appeals and meeting criteria. The bed becomes available, fantastic, we’re all good.…then I find out his insurance wouldn’t even cover the transportation there. So we had to wait *another* day for a charity ambulance ride to the facility.

Had another patient last week with MRSA bacteremia that needed daptomycun and ceftaroline for the next 6 weeks. None of the SNFs would take her because the antibiotics are too expensive for them to carry. We shoot for LTACH, which gets denied of course (Anthem this time) but I get this one, she really doesn’t need an LTACH, just a place that she can rehab at that’ll give her the shit she needs. I do the peer-to-peer, explain the situation. Doc says “Oh! Well let me see if we can pay for those so she can go to the SNF.” Call ends and I mutter “bull-fucking-shit you will,” to my phone afterward. I was right, we get nothing. I finished my 7th day on with this lady still waiting for a bed somewhere. 

I provided zero actual medical care to these two over my 7 day stretch. They got to sit in the hospital spending >$10k per day of their insurance company’s money only for them to not let them leave. Imagine staring at the same 4 walls, out the same window, eating shit hospital food, seeing a human nurse once an hour and me once per day, not able to even stand up on your own, for over a week. And you can’t leave because some assholes who don’t even know you think they know better than we do.

Fuck all of this. I know none of this is new to anyone. But where are they even making money from situations like this? All that’s happening is a longer acute care stay that will result in longer rehab stays, or a *short and unproductive* rehab stay that will lead to another acute care stay. I don’t understand.

Medical graduates are typically 24 years old.

The doctors going into private and public healthcare sectors are divided pretty evenly, almost 50% each. 

The [government website](https://csradar.com/grade/HA/Medical-And-Health-Officer) details the MONTHLY salaries for public sector doctors:

• Resident ($65,875 - $124,835 HKD), which is about $8,396 - $15,911 USD

• Associate Consultant ($120,520 - $138,855 HKD), which is about $15,361 - $17,698 USD

• Consultant ($154,700 - $249,900 HKD), which is about $19,717 - $31,852 USD

The salaries for the doctors working in the private sector is pretty hard to find, but it is apparently widely known that it can easily be 2-3x the public sector, and there's no cap on how much a doctor can be paid.

But here is an estimate based on a forum (Please comment below if you know! I just found out about this)

• [2018 Baidu forum](https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/502345734666021644.html): ""Average ANNUAL salary is between $1,500,000 - $3,000,000 HKD"" This is $191,188 - $382,377 USD

Edit: for a bit of context, I just want to add that I don’t know the answers to the questions I asked. A bit of personal history— I had a parent heavily addicted to prescription opioids. He finally got off of them and was sober for maybe a year or so. Then, turned to alcohol. I wish he had never gotten off the opioids because his alcoholism is horrible. It’s opened my eyes to how destructive alcohol can be. It makes me question the push to restrict opioids while there are virtually no restrictions in place for extremely harmful substances like alcohol. I guess I almost wish there wasn’t the push to nearly eradicate opioid use, but I also recognize I don’t really have a clear head about all of this. I think it has raised more questions than answers about addiction for me. Seems that the underlying problem is a personal risk for addiction, rather than the substance.

As a frame of reference, a US medical graduate is nearly guaranteed to get SOME kind of residency that will culminate into an attending.  Not every one will be able to get an orthopedic surgery residency in San Diego, but even the last place US medical grad can find a FP or Psych in somewhere rural and expect to be a full attending at the end of the residency.

The biggest bottleneck on the road to being a ""doctor"" is med school.  57% the applicants don't get in.  After that there are more residency spots than US medical graduates

After med school, your post-graduate years up until completely of post-graduate training are often labeled as PGY1, PGY2 etc.  Internship, in general is usually just your first year of residency.  Internship is generally not a separate process or a separate application.  There are some exceptions such as transitional years or prelim years, but those are the exceptions.

Often (particularly with internal medicine and general surgery) one will proceed with additional training after residency this is called fellowship.  For example, after 3 years of internal medicine residency I may choose subspecialty training.  These positions may or may not be competitive.  Cardiology and GI are competitive while ID and nephrology are not.  Basically any warm body can get an ID/nephro position.  However, cards/GI are not guaranteed

What happens if you don't match into cards or GI?  You can try again the following year.  Maybe try again twice.  I've seen people match on their second or third try, but obviously your chances go down after each try.  that being said, once you're in, your set.  The fellowships have a well defined end point.  Once you're in your nearly guaranteed to become an attending.

What happens if you don't match into cards or GI ever?  Well, then you are ""just"" an IM attending.  But you're an attending.  You can be a hospitalists (~350K/year last time I checked with 7 on/7off) or run your own clinic.  Or maybe even give ID, nephro, palliative a shot etc.  But no mistake about it you can work full time with all the glory and pain of being an attending after IM residency.

Health Alert on mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety

The COVID-19 pandemic brought many challenges that the health and medical field have never encountered. Although the initial response was led by a sense of urgency and crisis management, the State Surgeon General believes it is critical that as public health professionals, responses are adapted to the present to chart a future guided by data.

The State Surgeon General is notifying the health care sector and public of a substantial increase in Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports from Florida after the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Overall reports submitted to VAERS, Florida 2006–2022 - v2
Overall reports submitted to VAERS, Florida 2006–2022
In Florida alone, there was a 1,700% increase in VAERS reports after the release of the COVID-19 vaccine, compared to an increase of 400% in overall vaccine administration for the same time period (Figure 1). 

The reporting of life-threatening conditions increased over 4,400%. This is a novel increase and was not seen during the 2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign. There is a need for additional unbiased research to better understand the COVID-19 vaccines' short- and long-term effects. 

The findings in Florida are consistent with various studies that continue to uncover such risks. To further evaluate this, the Surgeon General wrote a letter to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) illustrating the risk factors associated with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and emphasizing the need for additional transparency.

According to a study, Fraiman J et al, Vaccine. 2022, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events, including coagulation disorders, acute cardiac injuries, Bell’s palsy, and encephalitis. This risk was 1 in 550 individuals, which is much higher than other vaccines.

A second study, Sun CLF et al, Sci Rep. 2022, found increased acute cardiac arrests and other acute cardiac events following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.

Additionally, Dag Berild J et al, JAMA Netw Open. 2022, assessed the risk of thromboembolic and thrombocytopenic events related to COVID-19 vaccines and found preliminary evidence of increased risk of both coronary disease and cardiovascular disease.

While the CDC has identified safety signals for stroke among individuals 65 and older following the bivalent booster administration, there is a need for additional assessments and research regarding safety of all mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

To support transparency, the State of Florida reminds health care providers to accurately communicate the risks and benefits of all clinical interventions to their patients, including those associated with the COVID-19 vaccine as additional risks continue to be identified and disclosed to the public.

The State of Florida remains dedicated to protecting communities from the risks of COVID-19 and other public health concerns, specifically by promoting the importance of treatment and promoting prevention through healthy habits. We encourage our health care partners and providers to do the same.",lemonjalo,83,136,0.93

223,dealing with death,115b58h,"Dealing with death

Hello everyone,

Please note, this is not a bash on medical staff, my family are doctors and I have the utmost respect and love.

I am a clinical nurse consultant. I normally work in the emergency department as a clinical nurse and have for 10 years.

I recently joined a team of nurses whom bring critical care knowledge to the ward and review and keep and eye on patients whom have risk of deteriorating.

Working within an emergency environment I see death all the time but I'm not the one making the calls with life and death. 

I am struggling months later to deal with a death of a patient. The clinical nurse consultant role is also expanded to respond to medical emergency calls secondary to deterioration. 

I had a page to a MET call for a patient who was in mild/mod respiratory distress. Two doctors were present, both looking at the computer trying to figure out this man's history. He had nasal prongs on and hypoxia. The doctors asked for a face mask oxygen and I told them to change to a non rebreather mask as hypoxia was worsening. By the time I had arrived no one had done an ECG. Whilst they gathered the ECG machine I had to get a nurse to me his history. I also asked for an acute resus plan - he was not for CPR. His condition worsened and I had PE (no risk factors) or STEMI on my list of differentials. ECG was not overtly concerning initially, during this time the doctors were trying to get in contact with their consultant.

My next plan was to call a code however he lost cardiac output and a code team (emergency department team) would be of little benefit as he was not for CPR. 

I have played the scenario around in my head for weeks. The gentleman deteriorated so quickly, thrombolysis went through my head but time was not on our side.

Due to the doctors virtually saying nothing in the MET call I feel his death burden is on me.

One thing I have learnt is that I have a new found respect for our medical profession whom have to have this weight on their shoulders day in and day out and I hope you know that you're so appreciated.",General_Task_7509,58,1,0.51

The second time I decided to call the physician to explain that one of the products had a large amount of acetaminophen per dose and the recommended dose combined with the other acetaminophen-containing-med exceed the daily limit. Their response was “I always write to not exceed the max dose of acetaminophen on the prescription”. I explained these were not prescriptions but OTC meds that were provided as a discharge summary. The response was “I know how to dose Tylenol”. *click* 

Now I had a 3rd patient who was picking up an NSAID.  During the consultation the patient stated “I’m not supposed to take ibuprofen can but is this medication okay?”  After further discussion it was determined that her primary physician had diagnosed them with epigastric pain likely due to an ulcer and was told never to use any more NSAIDs.  I asked the patient if the ulcer was mentioned this to the physician they saw today and they said yes.  The patient stated the new physician acted surprised “you have an ulcer?”  Still the NSAID was prescribed. 

The patient’s primary physician and the new one are part of the same health system so notes are accessible. I’m not one to “write the board” or try to get someone in trouble but I do feel like these are basic competencies and can/will lead to patient harm.

*Disclaimer: I felt it necessary to share this to a larger audience, warn other students and professionals, and bring awareness to the absolutely abhorrent behavior of a man who is actively involved in the education of medical students. I DID ALREADY POST* [*THIS*](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/110rcit/psa_since_many_people_seem_to_be_unaware_michael/) *IN* [r/step1](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/) and [r/medicalschool](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/) *but I received several requests to share it here.*

Quick run down: Michael Mehlman is originally from the U.S. where he graduated undergrad from Boston University. He left to Australia to obtain his medical degree, and *~~allegedly~~* *(see below)* graduated, only to decide medicine was not for him and therefore ran off to Osaka, Japan. He now makes a living from [$374/hour tutoring services](https://mehlmanmedical.com/product/premium-tutoring-packages/) and [$260/hour ""dating"" coaching](https://mikemehlman.net/skype/).

As some of you may already be aware, and I'm sure many of you not, Michael Mehlman advertises his [services](https://mehlmanmedical.com/) as a premium 1-on-1 Tutoring for USMLE, CBSE/COMP, Shelf Exams, Clinical Rotations, Medical Coursework. Within the last 6-12 months, there has been a substantial increase in interest for his free PDFs, paid tutoring, paid Anki decks, and videos. **He also boasts a team of 21 physicians and medical students who he claims are involved in tutoring services.** Michael is known to be active on Reddit, promoting his services as well as *allegedly* harassing anyone who brings attention to what I am now.

Michael [claims](https://www.studentdoctor.net/author/michael-mehlman/) (in multiple [places](https://mehlmanmedical.com/our-team/)) to have graduated from University of Queensland in the MD-MPhil program in [May 2016](https://mikemehlman.net/2018/10/29/how-to-be-more-happy/), however, a brief search of [UQ SOM clinician scientist student page](https://medical-school.uq.edu.au/clinician-scientist-track-md-phd-and-md-mphil) (MD/PhD and MD/MPhil) does not include Michael. This page includes all students and graduates dating back to 2012. [The UQSOM c/o 2016 also graduated in December, not may.](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1291192920955384&type=3) But again, probably a rational explanation for all this.

He also lists his credentials as [MD-MPhil](https://mehlmanmedical.com/our-team/) (*masters* of philosophy) but his credentials as a First Aid author in 2015 lists him as an [MD-PhD candidate](https://mehlmanmedical.com/usmle-credentials/). In addition, it states that he was in his **sixth** and final year of his program and yet (*at the time of his enrollment)* the MPhil route did not offer a six year option, only [four or five](https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-018-1337-5). The PhD route offered a six year option, but per Michael's website, [he did not pursue and obtain a PhD](https://mehlmanmedical.com/our-team/). Again, no accusations here, just observations.

**Edit: a user has pointed out that you can** [**search**](https://academic-records.uq.edu.au/search) **for qualifications of previous UQ students. Michael does appear to have been awarded a Master of Philosophy in 06/2015 and a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 07/2016.**

None the less, that is the least of my concerns. As I was googling, trying to find his educational website, I stumbled upon (and by that I mean it is *literally* the [first result](https://www.google.com/search?q=michael+mehlman&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS942US942&oq=michael+mehlman&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l4j0i512j69i60l3.2566j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) when you search his name) his [alternative website](https://mikemehlman.net/) **with his educational website very clearly linked in the main menu.**

**I've seen many recent posts and comments about female students utilizing his tutoring services only to be seduced, invited to Japan to live with him, and subjected to creepy, predatory, misogynistic comments**. Upon further investigation and talking to women from these posts and privately, this his happened more than acceptable (with acceptable being *obviously* for this to never happen). For privacy sake, I am not going to link their posts or profiles but I will share proof via DM if anyone is wanting.

Of course, everyone is entitled to their own personal interests/habits/activities, and one's character as an educator and medical professional should *generally* not be judged upon those personal attributes. However, I think it is absolutely deplorable that he openly promotes this ideology while simultaneously promoting his medical resources and services.

Here are some examples of his sexual/dating advice from various blog posts:

""...***I will now take my clothes off despite her being unwilling to take hers off***. I will stand up, take my shirt off, and then start taking my pants off.""

*""****If she \*still\* refuses****, but is clearly willing to touch you, you can stand and* ***put it in her face***, and she’ll take it, OR if she rejects putting it in her mouth after you’ve put it in her face, ***you can usually get an HJ out of it.""***

*""****She then says, “Haha no.”*** *And you say, “That’s all we have to do. We don’t have to have sex. I don’t want to have sex.* ***Just let’s get your clothes off and we can touch****, that’s it.""*

*""After I’m in my underwear,* ***I will just pull it out***\*, even if I’m not hard, and ***put it in her face*** *as she’s sitting off the side of my bed.""*

*""My point is that you should be trying* ***repeatedly to fight through her resistance*** *in an effort to get her home...pushing anywhere between 10-20x over several minute.""*

*""So you literally have* ***zero to lose by being an unrelenting asshole*** *who pushes 20x.""*

""***Regardless of the degree of resistance she puts up*** *when I attempt to bring her hands toward my chest, the next thing I do is roll up my shirt just above the level of my nipples and* ***then take her hands again and put them on my chest***.""

***""When she’s not allowing you to take her clothes off***, what you do is essentially enter repeated cycles of engagement-disengagement-engagement-disengagement...***Then you again attempt to take her shirt off***. She again ***resists***. You then once again disengage.""

*""If* ***she refuses to get on her knees***, you just repeatedly tell her along the lines of: That’s all we have to do. Then we can stop.""

*""I often* ***push the girl down*** *on her knees at this stage (Tier 2-style).* ***If she refuses***, ***I*** ***tell her to bend over the side of my bed*** *(Tier 3-style).""*

can't forget his take on sexual health and STIs: ""***whereas some dirty slut*** *who’s been with 300+ guys might not carry anything.""*

[not to mention posting shirtless photos on his official, professional medical FB page.](https://www.facebook.com/mehlmanmedical/posts/612330570904896)

here are some [screenshots](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IsLoPl7lY5DMuL3MOxVgUrIi8Ek-uZcg/view?usp=sharing) of a video michael shared (a now deleted video, as of Feb 15, however, not before I was able to make a copy), titled *""what I immediately do after getting her clothes off""* where he explains **a woman could be ""resisting"" or ""squirming"" and you ""gotta do what you gotta do \[to penetrate\]"" or you could just ""push her down"" and ""whip it out and put it in her face.""**

gotta also appreciate his empathy: [""I once pulled a girl home from a date who then started crying in my room about a guy who broke up with her two weeks ago and how she didn’t know how to move on. Despite being emotionally vulnerable and effusive, ***where taking a good cock would be the perfect solution for her for decades to come,*** she wouldn’t hook up despite my best calibrations.

anyway. just like my post on [r/step1](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/) and r/medicalschool I'm sure there will be a fair share of people who couldn't care less, and that's fine, to each their own. I'm simply allowing people to make **educated** decisions about what resources they utilize and from whom, as well as what services they participate in as a professional medical educator and who they link their professional image with.

as one user commented, here's a [2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvT68l2wdM0) that perfectly encompasses what is happening in this situation.

My question to PCPs is, if you aren't already, will you start offering medical treatment for OUD? Two hypothetical scenarios to consider:

1) A new patient establishing care mentions that they were recently discharged from the local hospital on Suboxone, and since then they've done well and haven't needed heroin. They ask if you're willing to refill it, and are more than happy to submit to a drug test to prove they've been ""clean.""

2) An established patient has been stable on Suboxone for years, prescribed by a substance use clinic that doesn't accept their insurance and still requires them to come in monthly, sometimes waiting for hours to be seen. They're starting a new job and ask if you can take over, which would save them a lot of time and money.

My consult question is regarding handling long term benzodiazepine patients, specifically when it is safe to not prescribe. 

I am a relatively new attending in a rural practice that has up until me joining last August been without a permanent MD. There has been a cycle of locum MD/DO/PA/NP providers for many years, and it seems for better or worse, a number of patients have been started or continued on chronic benzodiazepines. One example is a patient with bipolar disorder who has been treated with clonazepam 1mg QID and nothing else. Geriatric patients on tenazepam for sleep, and several patients on benzodiazepines for sleep/anxiety AND opiates for chronic pain (without snri, tca or gabapentinoid). 

These are not situations I am comfortable with really but I’m stuck on this contract to stay in the USA with my family. My attendings back in residency almost never co-signed long term opiates or benzos outside of palliative patients, which is my preference honestly. 

Once a patient has been on chronic benzos for years and years, how can I avoid prescribing? I offer tapers, but if the patient refuses what to do? Literally hours from the next primary, so there is nowhere else to go. Any thoughts?",bored-canadian,176,181,0.98

In receiving these I can’t help but chart review the patient and, this hasn’t happened yet, but if I see a patient that appears complicated my instinct would be to refuse to take them on as I already have many complicated patients in my own panel.

253,A follow-up,110vqbo,"This is a follow-up of my previous post regarding my life as a resident at my University Hospital. for context: [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/zmrn2q/judging\_people\_can\_be\_an\_inevitability/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/zmrn2q/judging_people_can_be_an_inevitability/)  


So, after around 4 months of my residency, I decided to quit. I contacted my seniors and informed them of my decision to leave my current work and travel to work for the NHS. To be fair, almost all of them talked kindly to me and even encouraged me to do my best. I started applying for jobs at a somehow increasing rate and took the path seriously. I even booked my first MRCS in May in the UK as a statement of confidence to myself and my family.   


The first few days of my quitting were marvelous to say the least. I slept full 7 hours and was able to exercise and eat healthy home-made food. I even started fixing things around the house which needed my care -my family depends on me for such things-. I went out with my friends and even made some new ones. I want to clarify that I am not unemployed and currently work at a private hospital for individual shifts and instruct courses for the European Resuscitation Council.   


On the second week, I started feeling strange: First, there was a call from an assistant professor at my hospital who knew of my plans and asked to contact me. He called basically to tell me that I was a fool for leaving and that in no way I am going to receive the same training in managing face and hand trauma as I do in Egypt, and that my job in the UK would be basically clerking patients. He worked for 6 months in the UK. I thanked him for his advice, then ignored the call and his advice.   


As of the time of writing this post, I am still unable to land a job. I understand that it takes time, but it adds to the frustration. Furthermore, I am still a member of the Whatsapp group of my department and photos of new cases keep appearing in my gallery -I did not finish my resignation papers yet as they take a lot of time-, and I can't keep myself from thinking about how I was making a change in that place, and learning. I remembered when I was super proud to pull out a nail from a patient's palm which was completely embedded and pinching the deep palmar arch to the capitate bone. I also remembered when I was able to reduce and internally fix an ulnar fracture successfully on my first time or when I sutured the buccal branch of the facial nerve around a repaired Stensen's duct...etc.   


I learned a long time ago not to regret my decisions, and that the man who made such a decision was no different than the one reconsidering today, the only difference is that the first one actually was in the scene and had a more rational, though sleep-deprived, mind.

I hate writing these letters and though I would ask Chat GPT to help out.  One big error is that this med is not FDA approved for this indication which is a huge miss.

Dear [Insurance Company],

I am writing on behalf of my patient, [Patient's Name], to request coverage for Alinia (nitazoxanide), a medication used for the treatment of Blastocystis hominis infection. My patient has been diagnosed with this condition and requires the use of this medication for effective treatment.

Blastocystis hominis is a parasite that can cause digestive symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloating. Despite my patient's efforts to manage these symptoms through lifestyle changes and other medications, they persist and significantly impact their quality of life. I have determined that Alinia is the best course of treatment for my patient's condition, as it has been shown to effectively eliminate the parasite and alleviate symptoms.

I have already tried other treatments for this condition, including [list other treatments], but they have not been effective in controlling my patient's symptoms. Alinia is a safe and effective medication that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Blastocystis hominis infection.

I understand that Alinia is not covered under my patient's current insurance policy and I am requesting that it be added as a covered benefit. I have enclosed all necessary documentation, including a letter detailing my patient's medical history and the necessity of this treatment.

I appreciate your time and attention in reviewing this request. I look forward to hearing from you regarding the status of this claim. If you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

I am a new attending in primary care, taking care of an underserved population in a residency clinic. Was hoping to get feedback on my current strategy for minimizing prior auths, denials of prior auths, etc, and also trying to help the residents navigate this mess.

\- When wanting to start an expensive meds (e.g., GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2i, insulin, etc). I have been googling ""X insurance company preferred med list"" and usually can find a PDF of meds listed as preferred, PA required, non-preferred, etc. Was thinking of printing these out once a year and keeping in a binder (so anyone in our clinic can use) or saving in a folder for my computer so I don't have to search everytime.

\- If a med is listed as ""prior auth needed"" then either prescribe it with plans to do a prior auth and forewarn the patient there will be a delay OR try to anticipate which med the insurance company wants me to try first and just do that one first. First example coming to mind is that I'm assuming I'm going to have to at least try oxybutynin and maybe another med before a Myrbetriq PA would get approved so might as well start with oxybutynin. Will need to try at least a couple of first line migraine meds before something like Nurtec. If they've already tried those things but their insurance is unaware then I guess I should prescribe what I think they need and then explain their past med trials in the PA.

\- Before I (recently) started doing the above, my strategy for patients who have enough health literacy is to ask them to call their insurance company and ask which med is covered within X class of medications. For example, which (if any) GLP-1 agonist is covered for obesity, and give them a list of choices to ask about. But then they can't really walk out with a script which means more follow-up work for us when they get back to us (if they ever do). OR I'd just pick a random one and tell them to let me know if it wasn't covered and we'd try a different one. This just felt too much like guesswork and inefficient.

\- My EMR is Epic. I've noticed a column within med ordering that says things like preferred, formulary, etc., but not sure how much stock to put in that and if it's referring to formulary for my health care system's pharmacy or for the patient's insurance.

\-When I worked inpatient, we routinely sent ""test scripts"" to our institutions pharmacy and they'd run it through their insurance with a cost of a 30$ supply. Haven't tried anything similar as outpatient.

Anyway, I've been working as a medical administrative assistant for years and we recently hired a new MD. Apparently this MD has a policy where she requires her patients to have an appointment every single month if they take schedule IV controlled substances. She insists this is what the DEA requires. I have never heard of this in my life and patients are getting extremely mad because they're used to only coming in every 3 to 6 months. And honestly I cannot blame them because not only is it kind of annoying, but it's a financial hit having to pay a copay monthly or if you're out of pocket it gets very expensive. Especially considering a lot of these patients are students who probably don't have much income and just need their ADHD medicine so they can do their work. I've tried to look up the requirements, but honestly I haven't found any evidence to support the MD's claim. Although, our office is in Georgia and I did find a page stating the rules and regulations for prescribing controlled substances in Georgia and it says this, ""No prescription drug order for a C-III, IV, or V controlled substance shall be filled or refilled more than six (6) months after the date on which such prescription drug order was issued by the prescribing practitioner and no such prescription drug order may be authorized to be refilled for the quantity prescribed more than five (5) times."" Now please correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't that mean patients have to at least have an appointment every 6 months to receive a prescription for controlled substances?

309,Is every healthcare system fragmented and awful? (Vent),10vn4ay,"Current MS3 in the EU. Fortunately, throughout my life, I've rarely been sick, so I've never had much interaction with healthcare systems. I've had a few problems lately, and in the process I  have navigated the healthcare system of three different countries. I am now more sympathetic than ever towards patients who get lost navigating the system. My experience:

USA (home country): Referred by my PCP to an allergist. Booked appointment with allergist. Arrive to their office, and was told I don't have health insurance (impossible; not only do I know I have health insurance, but for more evidence, I used it when I visited my PCP who referred me here!). Later told that even if I did have insurance, I should have called the insurance company before my visit for them to approve my visit (I.e. my doctors referral was not enough). I left for school the following week so I had no time to reschedule/figure things out with my insurance. 

Poland: Suspected UTI. Need urinalysis and urine culture. Referred to lab by PCP; go to lab, they do not do those test at this location, must go to their other location. Go to other lab across city, was told there is no bathroom for patients; I go to a nearby restaurant, pee in the cup they gave me, walk back and give them the cup and pay them. I check the results later: urine culture negative, no info about a urinalysis. Turns out the urinalysis was never conducted. Repeat process. 

France: Throat infection, made an appointment at an outpatient clinic at the American Hospital in Paris (1 hour commute from my hotel, but I needed a same day appointment where people speak English). Walk in, ask where I need to go; receptionist gives me a map and draws a line with where to go. I follow the line; the hospital looks much different than the map; I'm lost, and then starting to panic that I'm going to miss my appointment. I ask around and finally someone directs me to the right location. Doc diagnoses me with pharyngitis, prescribes me a few meds, one being prednisolone. I ask where I can get the meds, and I'm told any pharmacy. Great! I go to the closest pharmacy; they're sold out of prednisolone, and according to the pharmacist, so are many other pharmacies in Paris. I then keep walking around the city from pharmacy to pharmacy until I finally find one that sells prednisolone. 

I'm not writing this post for pity; rather, I keep thinking about how easy it would be for someone  who has responsibilities that would not allow them to be gone on all day to give up all together and just suffer with their illness. It is easy to pass judgement on patients who are referred for X but not ever follow-up with it/make their condition worse, but healthcare systems are so fragmented, referrals are often to strangers or businesses we've never stepped foot in, we have no idea what a patients income is, etc., that I'm surprised it's not more common for patients to never go to that specialist(s) you referred them to, get that sold out or expensive drug, etc. I have no idea how to fix these problems, so I've decided to just vent  -_-",,33,110,0.93

311,The Urinalysis,10v8e63,"As an emergency medicine resident nearing the end of residency the one thing, well actually there are many more, that I still struggle with at times is the interpretation of a urinalysis. The diagnosis of a UTI, or a ""positive UA"", is one that I see almost daily debated among ED physicians, as well as, between other sub-specialists and our IM colleagues. I was wondering if anyone could explain how to correctly interpret and utilize a UA (besides in just the diagnosis of a UTI) or point me in the direction of a good lecture/paper so I can educate myself. The topic of a chronic foley, UTI, and urinalysis is something that would also be much appreciated.

            
Edit: I appreciate all the thoughtful comments. This seems to have generated some good discussion and learning points. Other topics I wanted to bring up was:
1) The elderly demented patient in the ED with a *positive UA* and altered mental status
2) When to order, or not, a urine culture?

EMS report says 100.5F fevers, but acetaminophen was given 3 hours ago and the patient was in laying in bed next to a space heater. Labs showed a *positive UA* and WBC of 12.0 on the CBC.

314,Anyone know the penalty under CARES for not releasing patient records immediately?,10woi6p,"I have been in private practice as a psych NP for most of this very very awful Century. If all of the legislation passed to control  the practice of healthcare were called “unfunded mandates” on healthcare providers maybe the money worshipers would see that this comes out of their pockets now as they increasingly own all of healthcare. Regardless, I think that releasing clinically accurate psychiatric notes that are used to document care for my reference and for the next provider and to defend me in any “medico-legal” difficulties.

Regardless, I am not putting access to patients psychiatric records on my EHR. This is my hill to die on. Harming patients to follow a law? Won’t do it. I do not care who made the law. You might think that as a lowly NP I would grovel to follow the rules and attract no negative attention. But a key part of nursing that is drilled into us is that we are the last line of “defense” between the patient and the world check the med order to see if that med makes sense for this condition, don’t let random orderlies take them away for a random procedure, looking for lab results we know were ordered (not by us on the floor) and making sure they come back and what range they are in and to acting on the information. We are taught to defend that patient’s care and bodily safety like it’s the last patient on earth and they aren’t making any more. (I’m not implying that physicians are not completely dedicated to patient care, I’m just explaining the pit bull attitude in nurses that we have all seen and I am exhibiting.

Therefore, I am not releasing these records to my patients. It will destroy all trust with my psychotherapy and other patients. If the goal is for me to soft pedal my notes, I won’t. I go out of my way not to use pejorative language in my notes, however, psychiatric terms can sound pejorative to the layman. I’m not going to release my notes for my patient’s sakes. I am the one taking care of these patients. I have to take responsibility for the negative outcomes during their care. We work in a system marked by only negative reinforcements from government agencies and, at present, little respect from many patients. The money payers offer only goes so far to compensate for the sht eating. Also I am not going to spend all my time outside of sessions explaining to patients what their notes mean. No patients have asked so far. The government really really wants us to work for big corporate healthcare systems. I won’t. I will move back to Appalachia and work at an HPQRS or whatever they’re called. If the government wants to make private psychiatric care impossible, they can.

318,Attending billing when residents see the patient?,10v1w3j,"So I was always told that if a resident sees the patient, the attending must also see so the attending can bill.

If the resident sees but when I go to see the pt they are at CT/MRI whatever and if I don't see the patient that day then I don't bill, because I didn't see them personally.

But my partner took his daughter to the ER, only a resident saw the daughter (the pt) and my partner and his kid left 2/2 long wait. But he still received a bill from the hospital for ER services and the separately a bill for the physician services, though no attending saw his kid. 

So we are confused about this (bill without attending seeing) and wanted to turn to the hive-mind here for clarity 🙏

As I have been practicing for the past 2 years, it has come to my attention that the healthcare insurance companies in this country have become too powerful. They need to be placed on a checks and balances system of some kind, or the health insurance system needs a massive overhaul.

Insurance companies are year after year placing more pressure on physicians and other providers to do more nit picky things so that they can decline to provide payment for services rendered if nit picky thing was not done. These things have added up and they continue to add more administrative burden on us all. I am getting sick of it. We need to do something about this instead of continuing to take whatever they throw at us Year after year.

Whatever is currently being done to fight this obviously is not working. We need to do more. This is affecting all physicians and providers across the board. Should we go on strike?

Most onerously, I have been on service during working hours M-F *every week for months*.  When this was first proposed, it was ""until I had privileges"" (at this time, I was partnering with another attending).  After I got privileges, I immediately started taking service on my own, and it was ""until the end of the month"".  Then it was until I got ""busier"" (noticing a pattern at this point, I attempted to get a more specific threshold, which he refused to give).

I have several other concerns with his management, most of which can be summed up as micromanagement, but to be blunt I think the list of complaints is probably substantial and unique enough that it could be enough to identify me (this post started out a lot longer).  This is the most problematic one for me though.

SO, my questions:

1. How common is it to have new attendings staff service every week, during normal working hours but not evenings or weekends (except for an equitable share of call)?
2. When it is done, how long does the new attending usually cover service in this way for?  Is ""months"" a typical duration?  Is it more of a productivity threshold, and if so is that threshold the long-term target or some lesser amount?
3. If I object to this, but my chief refuses to budge and other division members stay out of it, do I have any options besides sucking it up for however long or quitting (which I really don't want to)?

Edit: To clarify, I also currently have 4 half-day clinics, with the expectation when I signed that I will need 5 to meet my eventual RVU requirements.

The way I understand it:

Sensitivity is used to rule OUT a disease. Sensitivity is best at correctly identifying the people WITH the disease.

Specificity is used to rule IN a disease. It is best at correctly identifying those WITHOUT the disease.

What is the actual difference between them? Imagine 100% sensitivity and specificity. The way I see it, sensitivity says, ""You have this disease because you tested positive"" or ""You do not have this disease because you did not test positive."" Then, specificity says, ""You do not have this disease because you tested negative,"" or ""You do have this disease because you did not test negative."" Is this line of thinking correct?

If yes, then aren't they both good at simply confirming or denying disease? Is it that sensitivity tells us we can cross a disease off the DD because they did not test positive, and specificity tells us we've confirmed the diagnosis if they do test positive? Is it that we use higher sensitivity tests when we're narrowing down our DD, then a higher specificity test to confirm our suspicions?

343,Overdoses involving methadone increased 48% in the US during the COVID-19 relaxation of 'take-homes' according to data from the Centers for Disease Control,10slsq1,"Here is the abstract of this newly published study in the journal *Forensic Science International*.

*Background:*

The US opioid overdose epidemic continues to escalate. The restrictions on methadone availability including take-home dosing were loosened during the COVID-19 pandemic although there have been concerns about the high street value of diverted methadone. This report examined how fatal overdoses involving methadone have changed over the past two-decades including during the pandemic.

*Methods:*

The CDC’s Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) was used to find the un-intentional methadone related overdose death rate from 1999 to 2020. Unintentional methadone deaths were defined using the ICD X40–44 codes with only data for methadone (T40.3). Data from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) on methadone overall use, opioid treatment programs use, and pain management use was gathered for all states for 2020 and corrected for population.

*Results:*

There have been dynamic changes over the past two-decades in methadone overdoses. Overdoses increased from 1999 (0.9/million) to 2007 (15.9) and declined until 2019 (6.5). Overdoses in 2020 (9.6) were 48.1% higher than in 2019 (t(50) = 3.05, p < .005). The state level correlations between overall methadone use (r(49) = +0.75, p < .001), and opioid treatment program use (r(49) = +0.77, p < .001) with overdoses were positive, strong, and statistically significant. However, methadone use for pain treatment was not associated with methadone overdoses (r(49) = −0.08).

*Conclusions:*

Overdoses involving methadone significantly increased by 48.1% in 2020 relative to 2019. Policy changes that were implemented following the COVID-19 pandemic involving methadone take-homes may warrant further study before they are made permanent.

CT downsides include small increased risk of bleeding, higher PTH, longer operative time and slightly higher cost.

I know many physicians in other parts of the world like India who swear by CT and that is all they do. But for some reason CT has been very slow to catch on in the US. The main argument I hear against CT is that evidence of CT benefits found by some studies is weak or inconclusive. Is there a stronger argument against CT/in favor of ET?

Given that CT likely has benefits over ET, it has been widely adopted in other parts of the world and doesn't have any significant downsides over ET why don't we see a higher adoption in the US?

>Antidepressants are supposed to work by fixing a chemical imbalance, specifically, a lack of serotonin in the brain. Indeed, their supposed effectiveness is the primary evidence for the chemical imbalance theory. But analyses of the published data and the unpublished data that were hidden by drug companies reveals that most (if not all) of the benefits are due to the placebo effect.  
>  
>Some antidepressants increase serotonin levels, some decrease it, and some have no effect at all on serotonin. Nevertheless, they all show the same therapeutic benefit. Even the small statistical difference between antidepressants and placebos may be an enhanced placebo effect, due to the fact that most patients and doctors in clinical trials successfully break blind.

In result the Chief physician started to order people to work even if they do not agree to help. You can refuse this order but if you do you have to face work-related legal consequences and would have to defend your case in a court. While you're likely to win (because the cases where even a Chief physician is allowed to order you to work once you have your shift-plan are very narrow) this is likely expensive and stressful, so at least at our hospital no one tried to refuse an direct order yet. I was ordered to work this way twice last year, in the last instance on December, 26th.  
As a result I decided not to pick up my phone anymore if the hospital is calling. You are not legally obligated to take any calls or messages from your employer in your off time in Germany. If the employer is not able to reach you, he can not order you to work. It's the only way to protect your free time.  
I tried to convince the other doctors to do the same. This was also the legal advice of the union's lawyer. Sadly my colleagues are very hesitant to provoke any kind of conflict. They complain about the situation a lot, but they are not likely to act to force a change. Especially non-ICU doctors with work duty while a sick note comes in are likely to be ordered to take over the shifts face to face which makes it especially hard to refuse.

So today the person that would have worked 12-hour night-shifts from Friday to Sunday called in sick. The Hospital tried to call me several times - I did not pick up. The Chief physician than sent me a Voice message via Whatsapp (It is VERY uncommon to get contacted via social media from you Employer) which I did not listen to.  
I don't know what happened after this. Someone will probably work those shifts. I am very sure that hell will break over me next week. The usual approach of the employer is a reversal of guilt, blaming me that others had to work in my place, telling me all the trouble is my fault while completely ignoring the fact that the employer is obligated to prepare for a typical amount of sick notes bei either installing on-call duties or a reserve pool (needs more staff) or paying for on-demand honorary staff (even more expensive that more staff). It's also possible that I will be threatened with legal actions.

I am sure that I am doing the right thing - legally and also to change the unbelievable toxic working environment in my hospital. But damn, I'm nervous as fuck.

391,Why do US Covid vaccine recommendations differ drastically from Europe's?,10npng9,"As you've probably heard, FDA was recently discussing the probability of approving an annual booster for ages 6 months and up. This will be in addition to the 3-dose series that they will continue to recommend.

However, many Western/Northern European countries (with amazing healthcare systems) seem to have a more conservative approach especially with children. Here are a few examples:

1. **Norway:** ""All children aged 12-15 will be offered a second dose of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, if they and their parents so wish. Those who have previously had COVID-19 are not currently being recommended for vaccination."" [Source](https://www.helsenorge.no/en/coronavirus/covid19-vaccination/#who-should-get-the-covid19-vaccine)
2. **Finland:** ""If a minor contracts COVID-19 after receiving one vaccine dose, they do not need a second dose for protection."" [Source](https://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/vaccines-and-coronavirus/coronavirus-vaccinations-for-children-and-young-people)
3. **Denmark:** ""From 1 July 2022, it was no longer possible for children and adolescents aged under 18 to get the first injection and, from 1 September 2022, it was no longer possible for them to get the second injection."" [Source](https://www.sst.dk/en/english/corona-eng/vaccination-against-covid-19)

Is it real semaglutide that they are somehow obtaining on the black market? Is it completely fake? 

I’m not referring patients myself to these clinics, of course, but I’ve seen several people now who are taking these injections and quite a few who are asking about it because their friends are going there. The patients do seem to be losing weight on it.  I’m really just wondering how concerned I should be. If it’s real medicine that’s questionably legal, that’s one thing, but if they are getting something completely different then I feel like I need to take a more active role in convincing people to stop taking it.

405,Do you swear in front of patients?,10mc3ul,"I feel like this is a bit of a grey area and ultimately requires the ability to read a room. Until otherwise knowing how receptive the patient is, one should generally not swear around their patients. E.g. probably not around your 80 year old ladies in their Sunday best. However I feel like it can be helpful in establishing rapport with some patients as well. If someone has a slip of tongue and then try and correct themselves I'll say something along the lines of, 'don't apologize for saying shit you would say at home'. Situations like when the patient is cussing frequently or using it with someone in a circumstance where it can lighten up the mood if you've heard them swear before seems helpful too. For instance to change the topic when a patient is talking about politics ""Ah politicians, fucking crooks all of them - right and left"". Another one I'll use is when I'm underscoring the importance of a test for some of my patients, particularly semi to frequently non-compliant ones, is ""I don't want you to take the FAFO route on getting this [stress test/whatever], this is important. If you don't hear from scheduling soon let me/staff know""

I’m completing my nursing bachelor’s degree at a well respected state university in the US, and the curriculum is rife with this kind of anti-physician/pro-nursing nonsense. I cannot understand what the purpose of this slide is, other than to indoctrinate younger nurses into thinking that physicians are heartless automatons who do nothing but treat symptoms and care nothing for their patients, but nurses are at the pinnacle of the “holistic” treatment of humans.  

The misrepresentation is so disgusting to me.  Imagine using the word “reductionist” to describe the entire medical profession.  Imagine actually thinking that physicians know only “basic science”.  The overinflated sense of self-importance on the nursing side of the chart is also gross, but less so to me than the other side.  


I would love to know what the physicians here think of this kind of inter-professional mud slinging, especially considering its presence in curriculum being taught to many students in their late teens and early twenties who’ve never worked with a physician and don’t know any better.

411,Circumcision,10lsoru,"Reddit seems to have a particular fascination with circumcision. It seems like every other week I’m reading a post in AskReddit or somewhere else about people’s feelings towards it.

I was taught in medical school that circumcision decreases transmission of HIV and HPV along with decreasing incidence of infant UTI’s and incidence penile cancer.

Occurrence of male UTI is relatively low, so clinical benefit is marginal at best unless high risk with urological conditions. Penile cancer is also relatively rare, so clinical benefit seems marginal.

Decreasing transmission of HIV seems like a legitimate reason for me and it seems like many studies have shown there are a significant number of HIV receptors on the inside of the foreskin. CDC states circumcision can decrease a man’s risk by 50-60%. 

Decreasing HPV transmission is also huge, especially for women as this is the major cause of cervical cancer. HPV vaccination is still low for men compared to women, but that seems to be changing via 2020 vaccine survey data with rates for girls being 77% and boys being 74%.

When the researchers used antibiotics to eliminate gut microbes, the mice got exhausted earlier and ran less on the wheel.

Clearly there are diagnostic US/POCUS that I could investigate, but I'm thinking more about procedural US.  I can see my hospital being open to starting a proceduralist service if I can demonstrate it will get patients out of the hospital faster.  Thoracentesis, paracentesis, LP, and joint aspirations being the common ones.  But I can also see abscess aspiration, ganglion/baker's cyst aspiration, and skin biopsies.  I'm also intrigued by the developing field of musculoskeletal US procedures - the new US guided thread carpal tunnel release appears to be done by physicians in many specialties (though mostly PMNR right now).

I was wondering if anyone here has experience with this?  Are there other procedures you would consider?  (And if you've trained on the thread US carpal tunnel release - how did you get trained?)  Being a hospitalist, some of my potential market will be taken by the ER (because they see the patient first), and I don't want to get in a political fight with radiology...but we're all so busy right now, I'm betting they would appreciate the help.

However, evidence of a causal link between the microbiota and tau-mediated neurodegeneration is lacking. In this study, we characterized a genetically engineered mouse model of tauopathy expressing human ApoE isoforms reared under germ-free conditions or after perturbation of their gut microbiota with antibiotics. 

Both of these manipulations reduced gliosis, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration in a sex- and ApoE isoform–dependent manner. The findings reveal mechanistic and translationally relevant interrelationships between the microbiota, neuroinflammation, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration.

435,Gut microbes might strongly influence the body’s thermostat,10kwn7p,"What’s considered normal body temperature varies from person to person, yet overall, the average basal temperature of the human body has decreased since the 1860s for unknown reasons. A study points to the gut microbiome as a potential regulator of body temperature, both in health and during life-threatening infections.

Work published in the *American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine* in 2019 has demonstrated that hospitalized patients with sepsis vary widely in their temperature responses, and this variation predicts their survival.

Yet the causes of this temperature variation, both in sepsis and in health, have remained unknown. “We know that temperature response is important in sepsis, because it strongly predicts who lives and who dies,” said Dickson. “But we don’t know what drives this variation and whether it can modified to help patients.”

 In particular, common bacteria from the Firmicutes phylum were most strongly associated with increased fever response. These bacteria are common, variable across patients, and are known to produce important metabolites that enter the bloodstream and influence the body’s immune response and metabolism.

“We found that the same kind of gut bacteria explained temperature variation both in our human subjects and in our laboratory mice,” said Dickson. “This gave us confidence in the validity of our findings and gives us a target for understanding the biology behind this finding.”

439,Advice please!,10jgpyr,"I just graduated from residency over the summer and signed a contract with a new job as an outpatient pediatrician in North Carolina. I have a history of significant depression and have been on antidepressants since my M3 year. My experiences in medical school really scared me away from asking for help. Unfortunately, this meant that any time I was struggling with worsening symptoms, I didn’t ask for help or talk to anybody in leadership until my professional performance was affected. In residency, I had to undergo probation because of how my poor mental health was impacting me and actually also took a 1 month medical LOA. Of course, this all shows up in all paperwork verifying my training. 

My current issue is with the North Carolina Medical Board. I was forced to be honest about my mental health because of my disciplinary history and the underlying cause not being disclosed on the official paperwork from my residency. I provided all relevant documentation and upon request, my PCP wrote a letter stating my treatment plan and her belief that I am fit to practice. Despite this, my file was forwarded to the Medical Director and legal. I just got notified today that they are demanding I be evaluated by the PHP before my license application can move forward.

How worried should I be that I won’t be issued an unrestricted license despite complying with all of NCMB’s demands? What can I do? What should I expect from the PHP?

We work as ER doctors under the supervision of EM specialists. The system here is very problematic. We are expected to keep patients happy. Patients who come into the ER cannot be denied service because their complaints are not urgent and have to be seen as soon as possible. Each physician sees over a hundred patients with very mild sicknesses (URIs, 2-day-old gastroenteritis, muscle aches, etc.). If one of those patients isn't seen quickly enough or doesn't get the treatment they want (usually IV salines) we hear complaints either directly from the patient or through the complaint hotline of the Ministry of Health Services. This morning, a relative of a patient was yelling because no one had seen her mom for 20 minutes, and they had to wait for nurses to come out of the resuscitation room. I explained the situation and she yelled something along the lines of ""WHAT KIND OF HOSPITAL IS THIS? DO WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR LONGER?"" and I simply said ""yes"" and walked away. She said, ""HOW DARE YOU WALK AWAY, I WILL REPORT YOU TO THE CHIEF OF MEDICINE"".  She was not the only patient complaining either, she was the loudest one.

Once the journey to becoming a physician has started, you are constantly chasing goals, board exams, clinical rotation scores and residency match interviews.

The journey is arduous and most of us feel a loss of autonomy, we are told once we become attendings it will get better.

A very small minority pause to reflect if the  end destination is what we desire and sometimes when we arrive we are left disappointed.

It’s something I have been struggling with the past 5 years after I graduated my residency and achieved attending status.

Only now am I pausing, to reflect, to think and seek understanding on what I want to do. I am very lucky to be in a privileged position, to be able to explore different paths.

449,A PA’s perspective,10hwv0f,"After diving down a rabbit hole on negative (some aggressively so) posts/comments regarding relationships between PAs and residents, I thought I’d share my experience over the past several years. 

A little about me. I am a former infantry combat medic now working as a Trauma and General surgery PA. I love being a PA and understand that my role on the team is not as a physician, but as an extension and extra set of hands for my surgeons. 

I know a lot of the issues with/against mid levels/APPs (or whatever) surrounds encroachment/creep. In my role, I don’t see much of it given the extremely close and seamless relationship I have with my attendings. As I said above, I am an extension of them. Can I function independently in certain aspects? Sure. Typically we make informed decisions together and as a team. I’ll bet there is more of this creep/encroachment in other types of clinical settings, especially clinic based medicine where independent practice is a hot topic. Anyway, this post is less about all that and more about my relationship with residents as a PA.

I work very closely with residents (we are a non-academic center rotation for them if that helps provide context), though we typically work different days. There is usually only 1 resident, sometimes 2 and our schedules overlap fairly consistently, usually once or twice a week. We have similar duties when we are on call. Rounds, first call, traumas, consults, procedures, first assist in the OR, floor care/critical care in the ICU, etc. 

I’ve had a fantastic relationship with all the residents I’ve worked with so far. We divide and conquer, helping each other as needed. I have the upmost respect for their educational process and actively go out of my way to ensure they get the procedures and cases they need. All I really care about is stabilizing and treating our patients to the highest standard. I don’t care who puts the cordis in. If an intern/PGY2 wants to put the cordis in, I’m making sure we have a good secondary at the same time or that products are ready to roll, and vise versa.

In the OR, if the resident is there, I will second assist or manage things on the floor/ICU/cover traumas. That is, unless my attendings prefer me to first assist for some reason. Working for that long together, we’ve become a well oiled machine and can anticipate each others next move. Sometimes our interns and new second years just aren’t there yet (I can count on one hand how many times this has happened though, as they are typically pretty fucking good). Toward Summer, our second years are very very good. When we have our PGY3+‘s are on service, it’s typically just me and the resident operating with our attending lurking in the periphery.

If things get crazy from an operative standpoint, I’ll make sure their side of the list is squared away, orders are in, families are contacted, and the notes are done so they don’t have to stay insanely late. If they do stay late, I’ll cover the hospital in the morning so they can grab an extra hour or two before coming in (they usually come in anyway though because they’re crackheads). Please let me know who I have to beat up so that you guys are paid at least as much as I am. The net hourly rate is nauseating. 

Given the nature of their training, I learn a lot from having them around. They are great with keeping me up to date on the medicinal side of critical care, something I learned very little of in PA school. What I enjoy and appreciate most is what they bring to the table from their rotations in other sub specialties that I have no exposure to. 

I’ve seen a lot of posts/comments  regarding the low intelligence level of PAs and how we don’t bring much to the table and make poor clinical decisions. While I can understand that rhetoric given some of my experiences with certain colleagues, I think its a gross generalization. I’ve seen physicians, PAs, NPs, RNs, techs, pharmacist make consistently poor decisions. It usually has more to do with them as a person and how much they are willing to apply themselves to improving their clinical knowledge, day in and day out. A lot of folks get complacent and overconfident, sometimes grossly incompetent because of poor confidence, and as a result, consult everyone under the sun, which has its own set of problems. That was a bit of a tangent, but I digress. 

I really enjoy working with the residents that rotate through our service and (unless my social intelligence is terrible) I think they really enjoy working with me as well. Truly feels like a team when we are on call together.",Stxrmr,83,486,0.92

Healthcare has a number of middleman platforms capable of playing either buyers or sellers depending on market advantages --e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, EMRs, MD/RN staffing companies, etc.  Newer middlemen continue to emerge, eg covermymeds assisting with PA processing between providers and PBMs.  Covermymeds is free currently but... monthly subscription fees later?

Unfettered profit extraction machines eventually turn everyone into paperclips starting with the fatcats at the top.  Becoming a billionaire means your every thought boils down to, ""more paperclips!""  It's like having a TBI: lack of self-awareness, diminished moral judgment, and increased perseveration.

Way back when I worked in retail pharmacy, I had a patient who had ""diabetes."" This patient came in complaining about the cost of their test strips and was talking about how ever since he made some lifestyle changes that his BG had been perfectly normal ever since.

I, being curious, asked what it was that had so drastically changed the state of his condition to where he was seemingly 'better.' His response was ""Well, I cut out drinking sweet tea."" I was a bit incredulous so I asked ""You cut out sweet tea, that's all you did? How much were you drinking?"" and he answers ""Well I'd have about four glasses a day. I also added four *tablespoons* of sugar to each glass."" 

For those not from the south, sweet tea usually contains 25g of sugar per glass. A tablespoon of sugar is about 12.5g. So with every one of this dude's glasses, he was getting 75g of sugar... four times a day. 300 grams of sugar a day. I didn't have those numbers readily handy at the time but I ballparked in my head. I really don't know how this dude didn't get repulsed by *that much* sugar. *No wonder* his BG kept coming back so outrageously high. (The ""bruh moment"" in question)

Similarly, is this specialty specific? For example, I suppose if you are a PCP working for a private practice, it is possible you could take all of your patients with you to your new employer.

The Ego in Medicine

I’m so frustrated. Without compromising patient info… a chronic pain patient being changed from oxycodone to Nucynta. The daily dose the doctor wrote for was over two times higher than their oxycodone daily dose (75 MME to 160). 

I call and speak to a nurse being concerned since usually opioids are reduced 25% when changing drugs. The nurse proceeds to tell me I’m calculating MME wrong and it is actually a dose reduction at 40 MME. I tell her to use an MME calculator to make it easier and walk her through it. She angrily stated “I’m going right from CDC you’re wrong.”  After walking her through the math SHE REALIZES SHE’S LOOKING AT TRAMADOL CONVERSION. After this she proceeds to say “well the doctor prescribed it and he knows what he is doing so he won’t be changing it.”  Further argument ensues on my part with concern for the patient’s safety. Finally she states “I’ll just have the doctor talk to you directly.”  I said please do so we can get that resolved. 

Hours pass with no call, new escribe comes over to cancel old dose and reduce to newly prescribed med.  This nurse’s ego was so great that not only could she not see her own error but she would put the physician at risk by okaying a dangerously high dose. 

Share your most infuriating ego story.

It was eye-opening, to say the least. I was skeptical about a lot of parts first, but the more I reflect, the more I realize that our action, or inaction, is partly responsible for the messed up culture in healthcare. 

I'm not going to summarize the whole book, but a lot of it was about elitism in medicine and how our egos and self-interest prevent reform for patients and doctors. 

FYI, If you're already mad reading what I wrote, you may be part of the problem 😉. 

Jk jk but for real, I started reflecting about the posts on r/residency and r/medicine and r/noctor and personal experience, and it kinda makes sense. 

For example, we love to rave against mid-levels, providing sub-par care. The very easy solution to this is to train more doctors. But just look at the r/residency sub, and you'll find a recent post about expanding residency spots and all the comments about how this will be bad for wages. The same sub will have tons of posts about how midlevels suck and shouldn't be allowed to practice. 

But it isn't just reddit. Our professional medical organizations rarely advocate for more residency spots. The AMA only recently started doing so, after lobbying AGAINST more doctors in the 1980s. If you're actively ranting against midlevels and silent about actual solutions to address the physician shortage, it's more about self-interest than anything else. Can't have your cake and eat it too. 

A few years ago, it was all Doom and Gloom for anesthesiologists because CRNAs were increasing. If anyone hasnt noticed, our gas buddies are still making a good living. In 2008 to 2012 most doctors were against the ACA, even though we knew it was better for patients.  One bipartisan bill against surprise billing in Congress comes up, and all the medical organizations come out with coordinated messages against it.

We’ve had an unusually high number of patients recently with persistent nose bleeds, and it seems like every time ENT is consulted they insist on using afrin. In the worst cases we finally had a pharmacist reach out and suggest TXA after going through half a dozen bottles of afrin with no result. 

The outpatient guidelines for afrin in nosebleeds is one dose followed by 20 minutes of direct pressure, and if bleeding persists after that to seek medical intervention with no more than 3 days total usage for sporadic bleeding.

You are the ""historian"" taking the history from the patient.  They are the ""informant"" or ""interviewee.""  You went to medical school and (typically) the patient did not.

I am often thinking of which next trip I will take for my next time off. Anytime I have time off, I go somewhere if I have enough money saved. When I was younger I used to want a family, but for whatever reason, over residency, I fantasize more about travel than I do about a family and thought I was undecided. But recently the thought of kids has started to make me feel uneasy as if it's constricting or would tie me down. Maybe it's the years of training and sacrifice and putting all those other things on hold that makes me want to just focus on my dreams of travel and live the lifestyle that's maybe a bit more luxurious than it would be with kids. I could see how rewarding it could be to raise children and watch them grow up. There are pros and cons to both.

508,Do Stimulant Medications Cause Endothelial Dysfunction?,10b9747,"Med student here. I got curious today about how exactly nicotine itself can cause endothelial dysfunction, which is something I've been aware of since working in a cardiology clinic for a couple of years. It seems like this is at least partially attributed to excess catecholamine-mediated vasoconstriction. For this reason, it would of course not be recommended for patients at risk of CVD to use nicotine in any form. 

This got me thinking, however, about whether or not stimulant medications could also cause endothelial dysfunction through a similar mechanism. Even ""non-stimulant"" medications like bupropion significantly increase levels of circulating catecholamines. More so with medications like Adderall. 

I am of course aware of blood pressure/HR monitoring in patients on these medications, but never hear endothelial dysfunction discussed on its own. In fact, it's quite difficult to find any research on the topic at all. Speaking from experience, however, even 150mg of bupropion can cause noticeable vasoconstriction (with normal BP/HR). 

 It seems like there's plenty of research on whether stimulant medications can increase MACE, but not a lot on whether they could be independently contributing to the development of atherosclerosis via endothelial dysfunction, even in the setting of normal BP/HR. 

Am I missing something here? Am I simply incorrect to assume that vasoconstriction from stimulant medications is not necessarily suggestive of endothelial dysfunction? Is this just a risk that physicians take when prescribing these medications?

513,New Epic Feature shows the divide between clinicians and health tech,10ahimb,"Got this gem in my email today: 

>Epic In Basket users will now see a new feature that will automatically “hide” responses that contain only a simple expression of gratitude such as, “Thank you.” This change was made by Epic to improve user In Basket efficiency by “hiding” messages that don’t actually need users’ attention. Based on Epic’s analysis, these messages constitute around four percent of Patient Med-Advice messages.

>When a patient replies to a Patient Med-Advice message (only) and includes ONLY the exact phrases in the table screenshot here (punctuation excluded), the message will be “hidden,” which means users will not receive a New Message (bolded) notification. 

>Example: If a Patient Med-Advice message response says ""Thank you, Dr. Ruth"", “Many thanks to you” or “Thank you. I need…” it would not be hidden because it does not exactly match one of the above phrases. In this case, users would receive a New Message. The message would only be hidden if it said only, ""Thank you"", “Thanks” or any other exact phrases listed in the table.

Thats right- instead of focusing on why it takes 300 clicks to close an encounter, they decided the true efficiency killer was providers receiving gratitude from their patients. I’d love to say I’m shocked by how tone deaf and misguided this is, but it’s par for the course unfortunately.

This week, her patients reported that Walgreens refused to fill prescriptions for controlled substances. She called, and Walgreens could not find an explanation but promised to look into it. Eventually they sent an email stating ""Walgreens will no longer dispense controlled substance prescriptions prescribed by you."" The email states to refer to a letter, which we haven't received.

After some googling, I suspect this is related to the $10 billion [settlement](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/walgreens_multistate_agreement_and_exhibits.pdf) Walgreens agreed to in December 2022 over opioids. The agreement has a section on monitoring and blocking prescribers. ""The Prescriber Review Process shall employ algorithms, or other means, to review data on Walgreens’ retail dispensing for potential Prescribers of concern.""  (see page 311 for more detail)

We are in one of the Settlement States. She does not prescribe opioids, but she prescribes controlled substances such as Adderall and benzos for psychiatric conditions.

While she is stingy with new patients and below the median for our state overall, she inherited a lot of patients (from retiring physicians at her practice) who were already on high doses. She is trying to taper them, but she can't just discontinue their meds all at once. So, she does have some patients on high doses (but a review of their records would show they used to be on even higher doses prescribed by their previous doctors).

Has this happened to anyone else? What can she do? She is freaking out that her license or job might be affected by this.",dillyknox,72,259,0.99

537,"How to have ""that conversation"" (CODE STATUS)",10889yh,"The topic of code status conversations has come up a lot recently in my professional life and after some reflection, I decided that I'd share my method for ascertaining code status with the r/medicine audience.  

I see a lot of residents and even my peers approaching the topic in a counterproductive manner, so I will break my approach down for the January interns (or the January interns inside all of us).  

STEP ZERO: Establish rapport and authority.  Not in the Cartman style of ""respect my authority, but rather the Marcus Welby, MD style where the patient or their family understands that you have a firm understanding of the current clinical situation and are confident in your medical knowledge.  Introduce yourself to the patient and all guests/family/friends.  Eye contact, use names, be personable, all that.  You can typically accomplish this by providing a short summary of the current situation and it's basic prognosis.  

STEP ONE: Probe for patient/family knowledge.  Ask what the patient or their family understands of the diagnosis and its treatment.  For a cancer patient, ask what they have discussed with their oncologist; is their proposed course of chemotherapy/radiation/surgery intended to cure or simply palliate?  For the elderly person in a rehab; is he participating in PT/OT and is it expected that the trach will come out and he'll go home.  Figure out what you need to educate them on. 

STEP TWO: Introduce the reality of the current situation.  If the patient is 90 years old, demented, unable to walk and in septic shock with respiratory failure, tell them that even with the best care, there is little chance that he will walk out of the hospital.  For the patient with metastatic cancer, if their heart were to stop, resuscitation will only delay the inevitable and likely result in the need for life support (ventilated, feeding tube, IV drugs--use colloquial language).  

STEP THREE: Gather information about the patient's wishes.  Ask if they have an advanced directive, living will, POLST.  Determine the NOK or POA.  Enquire if they ever said they ""wouldn't want to be on a machine"" or something similar. 

STEP FOUR: Give your opinion.  This is where the majority of physicians stumble.  They offer resuscitation as if it was a McDonald's menu (I am talking silly things like ""chemical codes"" and ""no intubation but give CPR.""  Tell the patient or family that in your medical opinion there is little chance for meaningful recovery if we intubate / start pressors and antibiotics / attempt CPR.  Explain that cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an attempt to bring a dead person back to life; I know that you are not legally dead until a doctor deems it so, but once you lose a pulse you are dead for all intents and purposes.  I frame ACLS as an attempt to ""bring you back from the dead if your heart stops beating by using chest compressions, electrical shocks, and chemicals.""  

STEP FIVE: Synthesize the answer.  Working with your knowledge of the patient's condition and their wishes, suggest the course of action that you think is medically sound.  If your patient is otherwise healthy and has a good chance for meaningful recovery, suggest full code with all resuscitation modalities.  On the other hand, if the patient has little chance of meaningful recovery, suggest DNR/DNI.  Explain that such a status does not mean that they will not receive treatment for their medical condition, but rather that we aren't going to interfere in the case of a natural death (ie their heart stopping).  If the patient is so unwell that they are actively dying, suggest comfort care with DNR/DNI and explain that medical intervention would only prolong the inevitable.  Use any knowledge of the patient's wishes to defend your position; for instance, explain that CPR is likely to result in uncle Ed ending up on machines and he said that he would never want to live like that.  

There it is, the EPIGGS method of asking code status and discussing end of life topics.  It's not a rigid step-by-step method and you are allowed to skip between steps, but documenting it as a stepwise process helps learners incorporate the material. 

The biggest take away is to always remember that you are the doctor.  You have the knowledge of the realities of futile care and the harms it leads to.  Do not hold your opinion back.  You are allowed to make a recommendation.  Expecting patients and their families to understand all the nuance and make the decision themselves is placing a cruel burden on their shoulders.  It is especially cruel when we resent them for making the ""wrong choice"" to pursue futile care.  

Informed consent means just that.  You inform yourself and then inform the patient and their decisions makers.  However, you don't have to present the options as equal choices.  Tell them bluntly what your recommendation is, be it full code or comfort care.  The patient or family can still refuse, but most are relieved to have the burden unloaded by a physician they trust.  

Trust is the key part of this process.  If you fail to Establish rapport and authority (""E"" in EPIGGS) they will not trust your advice and the process fails.

She came into our trauma bay on a backboard, alert but entirely disoriented, her face bloody and bruised. The EMS crew told us that she was a pedestrian struck by a vehicle.

To her, the world had became bright, and loud, and busy, and she was hurting and didn't know what was happening and she was frightened. She struggled to sit up, looking around frantically. Three of us guided her back to the bed, reminded her to stay still, and she relaxed until her reality began anew a minute later and she tried to sit up again. 

The trauma exam revealed nothing of note except superficial wounds on her face and head. She was taken to the CT scanner and the crowd summoned by the trauma notification dissolved. I wheeled her back from the scanner room, still awake but unaware, trying to tear the velcro from her c-collar now. I stopped her, over and over, each as new to her as the first. The doctor asked for restraints. I helped to tie her arms by her sides before leaving her with the doctor who was preparing to stitch the laceration across her forehead.

The trauma bays rapidly filled with one patient after another, so it was a little while before I walked back through her bay. ""Excuse me?"" I almost didn't hear her. In the bay on her one side, the residents were having a tense discussion about managing a crashing patient's airway; on the other side, a stroke patient struggled with her own inability to understand reality, sobbing ""I...don't...know! I don't...know...?"" while the nurse and pharmacist tried to confirm orders for thrombolytics before the patient's time window expired. 

""Hi, what can I do for you?"" 

""Can adjust this neck thing? It's crooked and my hands are tied."" The panic had left her eyes, though some nystagmus remained, and it seemed as if she'd broken out of the loop of reality that she'd been stuck in at first. I adjusted the collar and told her I'd come back to check on her soon. ""Thanks,"" she said, ""it sounds like you all are busy today,"" and she closed her eyes. A smile appeared at the corners of her mouth and seemed to radiate strange calmness into the room.

I did come back, and took off the restraints, and she asked me what had happened, and why her hands had been tied to the bed. The day was lost to her memory; reality for her started when she found herself in our trauma bay restrained to the bed. ""How long have I been here?""

""A couple hours, if that."" 

""I don't remember leaving.""

""Leaving?""

""Yes. I was here and I don't remember leaving.""

""I only know that one of the city EMS crews brought you in here, and they said you'd been hit by a car."" 

A flicker of fear crossed her face, and she pointed at herself. ""I'm Rachel. Rachel Stewart?"" 

""Yes, you are Rachel.""

She sighed in relief, ""okay. I think I was here for a few days and just don't remember leaving.""

I realized in that moment that both of us knew she'd been hit by a car only because someone else told us so, and wished I had more answers to give. Her concerned look faded, replaced by calmness again. ""Do you know where my glasses are?""

I’m sure it has given many patients access to care that they wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. I can’t help but think this is going to turn into another lawsuit on pharmacies like we have seen with the opioid epidemic. 

What I mean by that is, when patients are seen in a geographical area, doctor shopping can be made more difficult. Pharmacists have better access to prescribers and to raise red flags or get them resolved. Many telehealth programs don’t even have a line for healthcare workers to call, they just take a message through customer service.  

I can envision that 10 years from now, the same pharmacies are getting sued by the Department of Justice for “over dispensing” stimulants and benzodiazepines, despite no laws being broken.

I have educated myself on all neuro-atypical claims to separate fact from fad. Some of them have been valid and are self identifying their symptoms via these online videos.

I have also found a good local EP who does all the testing for POTS. I even have a methodology for the chronic Lyme crowd.

I was recently caught off guard when a young student, at the URGENT CARE, no less for crampy abdominal pain stated with unwavering confidence that she had SIBO.

For reasons that aren't really relevant I can't leave quite yet, but I'm looking into a transition to telemedicine.  I'd like to take some overnight and weekend call for that group as a way of trying it out and to make some extra money.  

My job is trying to stop me from doing so--can they really tell me what I'm able to do in my free time?  They don't know that it's a trial for a full time gig.  At first they said it would invalidate the malpractice insurance that they provide (telemed group obviously provides their own).  Now they're saying that because the health system at large provides telemedicine services, it's not allowed because of my noncompete (""will not provide services to any group that directly or indirectly competes with the hospital"").  Our group doesn't do telemed consults, so this is BS.  You can't tell me that ED docs don't moonlight in an urgent care.  Are they really allowed to tell me I'm not allowed to pick up a side gig?

591,Obesity is a Disease,100zgx4,"While watching everyone’s favorite medical show:  60 Minutes, I am surprised to hear that obesity is due to genetics.  The rationale the physician provided was that a child who has parents that are obese will be 50-90% more likely to be obese regardless of diet and exercise. 

This seems to defy the laws of physics. Since energy can not be created nor destroyed, how does someone pack on stored calories in fat from nothing?  

Also wonderful the show is sponsored by Wegovy, which would be highly profitable to say “you can’t lose weight, only this drug can do it for you”. 

Curious to hear others’ thoughts. 

My take: I don’t doubt there is genetic predisposition to being at higher risk for obesity than others, I’m going to stop short saying it’s a disease. I’d say it is a symptom.  Given that obesity has exploded after the past 30 years, that’s not enough time (genetically) to have such a shift due to genetics alone. I think it is a mistake to place all hope in drug therapy and not address all the garbage we put in our body. 

-A pharmacist

Edit for clarification:  the obesity specialist is stating the number one cause for obesity is genetics. 

EDIT 2:  this post isn’t meant to shame obese people but prompt discussion. The point I’m trying and possibly failed to make is that medications (while they work) are not addressing the problem of an obesity epidemic that did not exist 30 years ago. I’m not saying medications are bad, nor saying genetics aren’t a factor at all I’m asking how did we get here?  The story was thought provoking to me because the physician attributed obesity to MOSTLY genetics. If so, finding out what is expressing these phenotypes (as several users have stated) would be more beneficial to PREVENT obesity than to treat it. Also, personally don’t care if obesity is considered a disease or not, the title doesn’t make it any more or less of a health problem.  I will leave it to keep the original wording of the post.

I couldn’t find the first article again on their website which proposed slowly decreasing private insurance reimbursement rates to the level of Medicare to give “physicians time to adjust to the salary change”. Thank God insurance companies are exempt from monopoly laws or they would not be able to act in concert as KFF proposes to coerce their workforce—us—into accepting Medicare rates. If they actually tried this, this would be actionable under restraint of trade laws regardless of their exemption or maybe RICO? These people at KFF have MPHs. Why can they not take the financial constraints of the healthcare workforce, like student loan debt that was taken out in a marketplace in which a certain salary expectation to pay the loans back into account in anything I ever read about Medicare for all. These non-clinicians want to talk about money all day but never mention their pretty irreplaceable workforce. This post-war generation did not plan for their own demographic bubble retiring out of greed and immaturity. That is not my problem. I look at my $200K in student loans. That’s my contribution to their healthcare. This generation had 30 clear years in my adult memory of hearing it discussed to fix Medicare by increasing payroll taxes. It was a simple fix. If the government doesn’t pay me back my student loans with interest, I will quit before becoming a Medicare for All provider making $70K-90K a year. There is a whole lot of profit being gained by people not doing anything at all except buying rural hospitals and abandoning them which I didn’t think was legal. If you have to get special permission to open a hospital wouldn’t you have to get permission to terminate that responsibility to the community?

I feel the downvotes here coming already.  There is a knee jerk reaction on this forum (and the internet) in general that if you dont agree with ACA and/or universal healthcare you are bad.  This reductive logic is unhelpful.

&#x200B;

Truly, as physicians if we wish to see a path forward that helps us and not harms us we need to understand that there is some middle path forward.

&#x200B;

I wish to introduce some of the real issues I have noticed as a physician over the past 12 years of my career from med school on....

1. The ACA encourages cost increases to enhance profits.  In an ideal true capitalist world, healthcare costs would be ideally controlled if insurance companies were in tension with hospital systems.  Unfortunately the ACA discourages this.
   1. by capping profits as a percentage- executives at insurance companies can claim profits are small when in fact they have gotten far larger.  Eg- ACME insurance 10 years ago made profits of 10% on 100 million dollars of expenses -10 million dollars.  Since then, they encourage hospitals to spend spend spend requesting increasing insurance premium costs resulting in total revenues of 100 Billion- leading to 10 billion dollars in profits (because it is still 10%).  By allowing percentages they pull the wool over everyone.
      1. (Section on **Higher prices can boost profits) :** [**https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/05/25/613685732/why-your-health-insurer-doesnt-care-about-your-big-bills**](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/05/25/613685732/why-your-health-insurer-doesnt-care-about-your-big-bills)
      2. [**https://axenehp.com/perverse-incentives-acas-risk-adjustment/**](https://axenehp.com/perverse-incentives-acas-risk-adjustment/)
   2. Capex plays a tremendous role on why healthcare expenses have gone up.
      1. hospital systems claimed they create ""efficiencies"" to reduce healthcare costs.  They dont.  Instead, they order more expensive equipment to increase throughput all the while passing along these costs to patients with no real results to show.
      2. **Mark Cuban**:Another thing in Canada, they cover 70 percent of the capex \[capital expenditures\], including property. One of the challenges in hospitals here is, they want to get bigger and bigger and bigger, because the bigger the hospital, the more things, the more money the CEO and management makes, the bigger shit you look like you are. And a lot of times, they’ll go into new lines of business, cardiac, orthopedic, whatever, that don’t always work but are expensive. And so you see paintings, you see pianos, you see all the shit you see in the hospital. And they’ll raise money, whatever. They don’t do any cost accounting on that, and so they don’t know. Literally, a lot of hospitals don’t know how to account.[https://www.theverge.com/21557432/mark-cuban-interview-nilay-patel-decoder-podcast](https://www.theverge.com/21557432/mark-cuban-interview-nilay-patel-decoder-podcast)
2. **Medicare** is rife with inefficiencies.  These inefficiencies are not documented accurately in determining whether it is ultimately cost effective. It leads to perverse incentives and is ultimately the reason why health out comes/tests/procedure under medicare are not accurately addressed.
   1. (Section on **Administrative costs**) about [3 percent](http://www.urban.org/publications/411762.html) compared with [17 percent](http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-132R) in the private sector – may be to blame for the high spending.  [https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20130514.031171/full/](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20130514.031171/full/)
3. health care in Europe is not financially better for physicians nor patients
   1. I think in select circumstances- the circumstances that the media easily touts it is great- the broken toe, the flue, the need for insulin. If you are low income or indigent it is great. For anyone who remotely is professional, it is not great. But on balance, for people living there it has a cost that is exacted:
      1. Taxation - European taxes are high. Not just high but REALLY high.
      2. in germany for married persons 42% tax at 111921. That doesnt include healthcare tax which is payroll. 7.5% by the employee.  That is on top of additional payroll: unemployment insurance, pension insurance.
   2. This is no different in France, The nordic states, Italy. The taxes are roughly the same.
4. Physicians have to see a LARGE amount of patients to make ends meet.
   1. dont be fooled by medscape ""salaries"" of physicians.  They are the gross incomes.  After fees payment is much lower. After taxes, even lower.
   2. on average in Germany physicians see 53 patients a day.  FIFTY THREE.  Is this good quality care? Are they doing something magical? [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459004/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459004/)
   3. We talk about having a few doctors here.  It is FAR worse in Europe. [https://www.politico.eu/article/france-doctors-europe-too-far-too-old-too-few/](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-doctors-europe-too-far-too-old-too-few/)

I really dont want to play whac a mole. You can talk about singapore or nordic states or taiwan.  All of these have substantial issues of their own. No system is perfect.

So what can we do?

1. eliminate bullshit capex. It is really the cause of many of our financial problems.
2. reduce our administrative burden (something like thousand % increase in admins over the years?)
3. focus on real data that reveals how to reduce healthcare costs and improve outcomes:
   1. [https://www.annfammed.org/content/20/5/469](https://www.annfammed.org/content/20/5/469) \- studies showed time and time again high functioning providers worked in small private practice offices or small multispecialty groups where care was heavily individualized with a focus on low overhead expenses (low capex), individualized patient care (from same day appt, to med refills to triage) lead to FEWER HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS, BETTER overall outcomes, and REDUCED cost.
      1. ideally reduce regulatory burdens. I mean have you seen what it takes to run your own primary care practice?
      2. require insurance companies to reimburse in a timely manner
      3. address ACA accounting and reimbursement BS that favors hospitals over small healhtcare systems

we gotta stop drinking the Koolaid of M4A as physicians. Gotta stop drinking the koolaid that our health care is AWFUL and the WORST for everyone. it isnt. It is also not great ONLY for the 1 % ONLY for the most powerful. that is simply dishonest.

&#x200B;

Edit: more stuff to add...

&#x200B;

someone mentioned there is 'robust' data analysis done internationally by expert economists comparing our costs to universal care. I want to disagree with this. 

&#x200B;

Prima facie the above sounds reasonable. In fact, its the type of statement that closes the debate many times because we have heard it over, and over, and over again. See here: [https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019), here: [https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/iom-care-so-complex-its-cost-can-only-be-cut-through-learning](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/iom-care-so-complex-its-cost-can-only-be-cut-through-learning)

But, I disagree on How these costs are ""counted"" from a financial picture: 

&#x200B;

From a financial picture: Most economists do NOT concern themselves with taxes in Unversal Healthcare nations as part of the overall healthcare costs.  This is patently absurd but they dont:

the data is largely derived from the OECD.  When addressing healthcare costs, they break it down as follows: government spending and compulsory health insurance (“Government/compulsory”) as well as voluntary health insurance and private funds such as households’ out-of-pocket payments, NGOs and private corporations (“Voluntary”). [https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm)

No mention of the overall taxes.  None.  They dont account for it. So of course it is cheaper. They also dont account for overall costs of health care in terms of reduced pay for citizens- Less pay, more money is kept by the government for social services.  

When you look at overall tax burden and wealth, this is what you find: overall european wealth is lower than americans (when you exclude home values which skew in favor of europeans):  German households had just over 50,000 euros ($64,080) in wealth, the lowest in the euro zone [https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-19513](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-19513). [https://cepr.net/documents/wealth-scf-2014-10.pdf](https://cepr.net/documents/wealth-scf-2014-10.pdf). 

For retirees, the amount of money in the bank is far lower in europe than USA: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB993678277359235474](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB993678277359235474)

finally, tax policies are much more onerous on the Europeans. This tax difference accounts for a SUBSTANTIAL cost and is conveniently ignored in cost comparisons: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304778304576377710593726674](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304778304576377710593726674)

601,Vertigo doc assumes role of veterinarian toxicologist during the holidays. Long story.,zzv54c,"So I’m a 6 hour drive away from home visiting my wife’s family.
Myself, my wife, my two adult sons and my oldest son’s girlfriend, and Epley our 2 year old Swedish Vallhund had an relatively uneventful drive on Dec 26 despite recent weather.

A nice short visit, and the night before the drive back, Epley is acting weird according to my son and vomits once, so my son wakes me at 0100, partly to have me check him out, and partly because he didn’t want to clean up the vomit.  

Epley has had a bowel obstruction twice in the past, both times from eating acorns.  The first time the surgeon was able to retrieve an acorn from his butt which solved the problem.  The second time he had to have surgery as it was stuck in his jejunum.

The vomit a small amount, was mostly clear, slight pinkish colour, but no blood.
Epley was very restless, pacing back and forth, wanting to go out but not doing anything other than to look for things to eat on the snow.  His heart rate was 108, which seemed odd, as he only became tachy after a day or so of bowel obstruction the other two times.   And when he had the bowel obstruction, he wasn’t agitated, more very quiet.  And there were no acorns to be found with the snow on the ground.

In any case, he was too agitated to leave alone, so I leashed him and I lay down on a sofa beside a dog bed to try and quiet him and keep an eye on him.  He proceeded to product a small amount of brown liquid vomit, no food in it, and smelled  sweet?  Could he have eaten chocolate?  I looked around for wrappers, or some evidence of him foraging for chocolate and couldn’t find any.  

He continued to be very revved up and not long after vomited a large amount of brown stuff which looked like, smelled like and had the consistency of chocolate pudding.  

Our previous dog, a duck toller, once ate almost 2 pounds of milk chocolate which prompted a visit to the emergency vet clinic at midnight on a Friday night a decade before.  They gave him ipecac and charcoal and discharged him home much more revved up and tachy than Epley was so I was pretty sure Epley would be able to ride this out.

After 3 hours no sleep and cleaning up vomiting every 20 minutes, my wife relieved me for a couple of hours.  

I had to get back home to work a shift, so we had to travel back the next morning.
He was still vomiting every 30 mins or so, but only small amounts of chocolate mess.

Armed with paper towels, baby wipes, garbage bags and wet rags to clean, we piled into my sports sedan, all 5 of us and Epley.

As we started down the long rural driveway, not 50 yards down, Epley vomiting all over my son’s girlfriend in the backseat with no warning.  Shrieks of surprise and disgust and all 4 doors opened and the car emptied.  My brother in law was in his front window laughing his head off. Did the best we could cleaning up and carried on.

Luckily, only 2 other small emesis episodes in the next several hours, and he slept a lot during  the drive.  By the time we got home he ate and drank like a horse, and is now his usual self.

The funny thing is that despite a thorough check of the house, we never found supporting evidence that he got into chocolate.

He was denied because the physician reviewing his case thinks acute rehab is only for medically complex patients, and not for people that need to learn to walk again so they can go home.

I've had denials before because companies didn't want to pay for the super expensive new drug, or for acute rehab because of questionable benefit. I've never had a denial from someone who didn't know or was willing to consider that neurorehab exists.

Serenity now.

Edit: to be clear they wanted the pt to go to subacute instead of acute. Despite the fact that he was fully capable of handling 3 hours rehab a day and works out in his room between pt sessions.

Because of the respiratory season and our hospital’s refusal to pay/retain nurses, we are currently boarding in the ER at the main hospital. Because of that…we are also boarding at our smaller satellite hospitals because transfers take FOREVER! For example, yesterday I had a CHF/pneumonia/sepsis on bipap that took 17 hours to finally leave our ER. Along with 4 other equally sick holds.

I was trained to be an ER doctor. I feel like I was trained well. I was not, however, trained to take care of patients for 22 hours straight in addition to seeing all of the other emergencies/non-emergencies that walk in. 

Any helpful tips? Anyone in a similar situation? Any common mistakes you see after transfer? Some examples I’ve had so far:

-What meds are best for elderly patient sleep?
-What meds should I avoid giving more than one dose of? What meds should I schedule?
-What is a good fluid maintenance rate for someone with CHF with AKI? Or do they even need it?
-When can the patient eat?!?!? /s

Of course I learned a lot of this in residency off-service and med school…but I’m not going to act like my ER training has me prepared to treat “should be admitted” patients the same way as an IM/FM/ICU doctor.

As a student entering the profession with shared passion, I have no doubts looking back but fear I lack leadership in this area looking forward. I hear valid, justified complaining but little direction towards how to engage with an organization who will *do* something. 

So I’m sincerely asking, both generally and specifically— 

—What organizations may show hope for sticking up for physicians in meaningful ways? 
—What should physicians do on an individual level to work towards progression?",SlipperyDelivery,196,344,0.91
633,My employer makes me feel like a child with a behavioral star chart,zvze98,"Since I started working for a large academic health care center, my contract has included a statement that am expected to comply with clinic rules and expectations. This sounded reasonable when I signed. It turns out that there is a 3 page list of requirements in multiple categories (most of which are for clinical work even for those who are mostly research-supported). To ensure that we earn our entire base salary, we have to comply with all of the items, otherwise we risk losing part of it. This includes items as specific as having to see 3 new patients for every 2 return appointments, and responding to all patient messages within 3 days. Complying with the entire list makes me feel more like a trained seal than a physician. But there's more...

 In order to earn a bonus (something that was presented as basically ""guaranteed"" when I was considering the position), we have an expansion of that list (another 3 pages), and need to earn  8 points. The bonus pay items are slightly more flexible but also significantly more challenging (e.g. include items like having over $250K in new research funding or creating a new, billable service for the department). We get fractions of the total bonus amount for earning fewer than 8 points.

I can appreciate that some MHA thought this would be gamelike, but I feel insulted and manipulated. Curious to know if other academic/employed physicians have similar kinds of extreme behavior management ploys to comply with? And has anyone succeeded in changing their management to one that is less prescriptive (without quitting)?",Hebbianlearning,109,408,0.97

I’m a hospitalist and admitted a patient last night that stated I was not allowed to review old records in her chart. She was there for a pretty straight forward problem so I just documented what she had stated and did my care based only on the history she gave me. I did email legal this morning to see what their thoughts are. A situation like this is not something I had even considered before. Has anyone experienced this? Thoughts?


Edit: one thing I found interesting is that our consent to treat document she signed contains a clause granting permission for obtaining a history, performing a physical exam, and all the other basic components of caring for a patient, but nothing about accessing all the records.  If the lawyers feel we need a signed consent for all that, it doesn’t feel too extreme for a lawyer to sue because the patient didn’t consent to accessing records ( yes it would be a complete BS reason to sue, but so is most of the medical legal system).

*Background: USA. Most of her care is through our healthcare system so outside records is not an issue. She did sign a consent for treatment (I’ve never even looked at one of these before this) with a clause consenting to sharing of her healthcare information with past, present, and future providers but nothing that specifically consented to allowing access to old records during the current encounter. *",NotDrNick,272,556,0.98
638,Evie Toombes case - case of wrongful conception/life recently won in UK,zvm3bq,"aka why neo, peds and OB have really long tails! (18 years baybeee!) 

Finding reputable links on this story was challenging, but it seems the basis of the complaint was that Evie's mother went to the doctor prior to conception and asked if there was anything she should do, supposedly even asking about folic acid, and the doctor did not stress the importance of it.  Evie was subsequently born with lipomyelomeningocele.  

The case was basically that if the doctor had told her about the importance of folic acid, she would have waited longer to get pregnant and therefore would not have had a child with myelo.  The lawsuit was apparently started just after birth and the girl is now 20, and took over the lawsuit for herself.  

There was apparently a note from that visit that said ""folate, if desired"".  The doctor says he does not remember the appt (which is of course understandable, as it was a routine appt)  

Essentially, they found that by leaving it as a ""if desired"", that did not give proper medical advice for the time period (folate's link to neural tube defects was widely accepted in the early 90s, and this child was conceived in 2001, so it was not a new or controversial recommendation), which then left him liable.  

[https://people.com/health/woman-with-spina-bifida-wins-case-against-her-mothers-doctor-for-negligent-pre-pregnancy-advice/](https://people.com/health/woman-with-spina-bifida-wins-case-against-her-mothers-doctor-for-negligent-pre-pregnancy-advice/)

Starter comment: 

Wow am I uncomfortable with this.  The doctor did not give proper advice, or rather, he didn't give it as strongly as he should have, but there's zero way to know that a) she would have followed it b) she wouldn't have gotten pregnant by accident c) that even if she delayed conception that the child wouldn't have myelo (yes, folate is important but it does not remove the existence of neural tube defects) 

On one hand, I think it is good to hold quacks accountable, because they are so often not - and I think there needs to be a better way to address that (I'm thinking of Burzynski and demon sperm doctor) beyond just malpractice.  No one is entitled to a license, and if you cannot meet standards, then your license should go away as well.  

BUT, on the other hand, come on.  It seems like this doctor wasn't a quack, but was just not using strong enough speech for their liking, which is bullshit. And by 2001, it shouldn't even be something a doctor needs to tell you, honestly. He didn't tell her to start doing meth or give her thalidomide or accutane knowing she was pregnant. 

And of course, the biggest sticking point for me is that no matter what, there is no guarantee that the girl wouldn't have had a neural tube defect even if her mother was getting sufficient folate.  There seems to be zero proof that she was folate deficient at the time of getting pregnant.  

Finally, I hate the 'wrongful life/conception' type suits usually.  I think there would be a case if a woman wanted an abortion and was refused and the child had medical needs that the mother couldn't handle (and knew she couldn't handle), maybe.  But in cases like Evie, the parents are saying in a way, they don't want her around, because if they hadn't conceived when they did, it would be another egg, which would be a different child.  I don't know, it's squicky to me.",sapphireminds,31,135,0.96
639,"""You don't know that?!?""",zvevso,"RANT

M4 here. Anyone else feel super annoyed when, in a non-medical setting, someone, usually a lay person, asks some obscure medical question and you just straight up say ""I don't know"" and they impugn your education/validity as a doctor/medical student? This really only applies when the question/information is outdated, or not real, or not even in the scope of medicine or even science.

This bothers me even more when the question is misguided but the friend just fully believes it 100%. ""You don't know that inbred people are, like, physically stronger than other people?!? No that's a real thing i read on [some random website]. What are they teaching you in school?!"" is a recent example where I just had no idea how to respond gracefully.

The one-two punch of ""wow you don't know anything! i wouldn't want to be your patient!"" is always a good follow up too.

Shit's REALLY not helpful for the ol' Imp syndrome. 

It feels like it's maybe part of a weird transition of non-medical friends who knew me before, during, and now at the end of medical school. Like, they don't know how to adjust to the idea that their (idiot) friend will be a doctor soon. I think for the most part it's supposed to be good humored but they obviously don't understand how much school has sensitized me to pimping lol.

How do you all deal with it? (other than frantically googling to see if you *should* actually ""know that""). Am I being too sensitive?

>*Dr. Jaspreet Loyal (Attending):* Last year when I was covering the inpatient pediatric wards on a weekend, I asked one of the new interns if this was her “Black weekend.” It was my feeble attempt to empathize with her tough intern schedule. In the medical community, the term “Black weekend” is common phrase defined a five-day work week followed by a Saturday and Sunday shift. It has a very negative connotation. I recall the intern taking a deep breath as she gathered her thoughts to respond to my seemingly naïve yet deeply offensive and racist question. She said, “*Dr. Loyal thank you for asking. I am in fact, working both days*.” She sighed and there was a long pause. “*I know you care a lot about residents and you will understand where I’m coming from. I just wanted to point out that using the word Black with the weekend associates the word Black with something very negative.”* She courageously went on to give me the historical context of decades of injustice and racism towards members of the Black community. She shared how using that phrase was hurtful. She very respectfully suggested using alternative phrases and although embarrassed, I authentically thanked her for her courage in breaking the hierarchy to call out racism by an attending.

666,am I helping or hurting by writing this med school rec letter for local HS student?,zt4h8e,"TL: DR - One of my pediatric patients who shadowed me a couple of times asked me to write a reference letter for her for a guaranteed admit college/med school program. Could I hurt her chances by writing a letter given my role as her pediatrician, or if I write a letter that discusses her character and independence but doesn't discuss academic qualifications?

&#x200B;

Just some background, because I feel like there's a lot of kind of weird professional and personal relationship mishegas here. I am a rural pediatrician practicing in a low SES town for about 1-3 years. One of my long term goals here is to try to build support for local kids to go into the medical field. As you can imagine, in a small town, we don't have a ton of medical experience options for the kids who are interested, so I offer the kids who want to become doctors the chance to shadow me. It's not ideal because they're my patients and I feel like there's sort of a conflict of interest there, but I also don't know what other options these kids have and I want to offer them something. I did of course have her go through our clinic administrators to set up the shadowing experience, and this is something they've apparently done before, since it didn't seem like it was a very irregular request. 

&#x200B;

One of these kids, who is very bright, independent, and hard-working, shadowed me a few times over the summer. She asked me to write her a reference letter for an auto-admit college-to-med school program. I obviously can't comment much on her academic success, since I only know her in the ""shadow"" context and as my patient, so any letter I would write would focus on her personal qualities and background rather than academic or extracurricular achievements. I would be supplementing this with information from her personal statements and CV, and I was planning on discussing the context of her being from a medically underserved rural town. 

&#x200B;

I want to support her chances as best I can, and most of me feels like it couldn't possibly hurt to write a brief letter like I described. There's a smaller part of me that wonders if the admissions officer could think that the pediatrician writing a letter on behalf of their own patient is ethically dubious or weird or...I don't know, something else that I'm not considering because I'm not an admissions officer. Also, if I remember correctly, disclosing a doctor/patient relationship violates HIPAA, but if I don't disclose that relationship to an admissions committee, that feels like I'm hiding a conflict of interest. Are these at all realistic concerns? I definitely recognize that my letter might not be that helpful, just  because I can't comment on academics at all, but I want to at least make sure that a positive letter wouldn't hurt her chances. 

&#x200B;

674,Is tramadol bad?,zs9mie,"So I'm in primary care and one of my colleagues has been harassing me about my preference for prescribing tramadol to opiate-naive patients. I thought it was great. I thought it was a relatively non-addictive drug, I thought since everyone is depressed anyway, we should use it for the mild SSRI effect.

I pulled up some articles that have made me second-guess myself. Tramadol carries a risk of serotonin syndrome (due to the mild SSRI effect). Another report says ""weak opioids ""like codeine, dihydrocodeine, and tramadol are no less risky than morphine. Then I read that tramadol can interact with warfarin to raise the INR. Yikes.

So I kept reading. Another article discusses **which opioids are best in the elderly and in CKD**.

* Buprenorphine, transdermal fentanyl, and oral hydromorphone are the most tolerable
* Hydrocodone, oxycodone and methadone are helpful but require careful monitoring
* **Tramadol**, codeine, morphine, and meperidine should be **avoided in the elderly** due to the risk of accumulation and adverse events.

Another article said there was no superior analgesic efficacy with the administration of hydrocodone/acetaminophen when compared to patients receiving tramadol in the relief of cancer pain! Additionally, tramadol produced more side effects than hydrocodone. I try to avoid Norco in favor of Tramadol when I can. Is that wrong? I'm starting to think so.

One article says Tramadol provides inadequate analgesia to hydrocodone-acetaminophen in ED patients with acute musculoskeletal pain.

So, medical experts of Reddit: what are your thoughts on Tramadol (ultram)? TYSM!

Out of town faith-based psychologist that our local DHR refers to constantly, and I get these nonsensical reports from him. Got another one today so fresh on my mind. PhD so you'd think would know better.

Most common is diagnosing every single patient with ADHD, based on _any_ positive answer to his brief self made screen. Like, I had a new patient with florid Tourette's in foster care whom DHR sent-- he obtained no parent, foster parent, or teacher input but asked the kid if he had trouble being still. Um, yes, due to tics. Boom, ADHD dx. No evidence of ADHD when I worked him up.

He does this for kids fresh in foster care with obvious trauma and no prior symptoms. Who is going to be able to pay attention a couple of weeks after being removed from home? But he gets them in fast. Then DHR shows up wanting meds and I'm left explaining why it's not appropriate.

Today I got one with his usual ADHD, this time correct, but also disruptive mood dysregulation disorder-- but get this-- zero negative mood between anxious meltdowns. I'm 99% sure kid has autism, strongly positive CAST and my observations. Parent thought they were seeing him for that but he did a Social Communication Quotient, SCQ, which has unacceptably low sensitivity for someone with concerning symptoms, and told parents she didn't need a full evaluation.

692,Students asking about medical practice traditions taken for granted,zqsq6b,"When teaching medical students things such as measuring blood pressure or bedside examinations, they sometimes ask questions such as ""why do we measure BP manually although automatic devices exist"" or ""why must we stand at the right side of the patients?""

About BP, sometimes I tell them to think of it like learning to drive a manual car although you're going to be driving an automatic car most of the time - to be prepared for when automatic devices are unavailable or if they travel to other countries or locations where resources may be scarce.

As far as ""accuracy"" of the readings of manual vs automatic BP measurement, I've found some conflicting data, but manual measurement is sometimes seen as the more accurate method, if done correctly.

About standing to the right side of the patient, I suppose performing certain examination techniques (such as assessing liver span or otherwise) may be easier that way, even for left-handed people, although I imagine other parts of the examination may be easier for lefties to do from the left side.

But the question is probably about its significance: does it really matter enough to lose marks over, as long as the objective of the examination is fulfilled?

I've done a quick informal search to see what's been written on the matter but I haven't found particularly satisfying answers.

It seems that modern media depicts medical intervention as a save-all, when it’s much more complicated.  I’ve seen people who blame the doctor and are upset that their chronic migraines were not resolved within a single visit. They weren’t diagnosed with celiac’s despite having all the symptoms. They went to the doctor but still have chronic back pain. 

Many conditions are not easily treatable, there’s no quick fix. Even conditions where the diagnosis + treatment creates hope (e.g. anxiety, fungal infection) there is a delay between starting medication and feeling better. For complex conditions there is often no diagnosis within one visit. And that leaves people unsatisfied and upset. So my question is:

For example, some providers see a medical problem related to my specialty and will auto-consult.

It is also less of an issue when the hospitalists and surgeons ask me to see a patient because those can usually wait until the next day, but that is not the case when certain ER providers do it. One or two ER physicians will consult with any chief complaint related to my specialty (and often not related to it), and it does not matter if it is morning or evening.

Administration does not care about this. I have tried some malicious compliance techniques - i.e. saying I will see the patient many hours after I get called. In the end, it often just makes it more difficult for me and the patient. Half of the time the patients even question why I am seeing them.

701,STOP Saying Primary Care is Easy! (+ Reflections on Scope Creep),zoln3c,"Recently was having dinner with a friend currently in his last year of pharmacy school. We were discussing recent initiatives to try to increase independent prescribing authority for pharmacists and he said ""well primary care is so simple, we (as in pharmacists) can handle most things easily."" When I probed him further, he gave example of empiric antibiotics rx for dysuria and ear pain to treat UTI and AOM, respectively.

My take-on this (and I am a strong proponent of team-based, physician-led care) is that this view of primary care that is perpetuated in medical/healthcare culture is inaccurate and disrespectful to the breadth + depth of knowledge PCPs have. As a family physician myself, I don't just jump to Macrobid when someone comes in with dysuria. Pharmacists are definitely more knowledgeable than me in certain aspects of pharmacotherapy, but physician training is more than matching complaints to medications - our training teaches us to take holistic medical histories, perform focused physical exams, generate prioritized lists of differential diagnoses, consider and interpret appropriate work-up including labs/imaging, and recommend treatments (both pharmacologic + non-pharmacologic).

Dysuria can be SO many things beyond UTI: vaginal atrophy, STIs, BPH, strictures, stones, contact dermatitis, interstitial cystitis, medication-related, and even (rarely) cancer. Diagnosis of AOM requires otoscopy, which our pharmacy colleagues are not trained to do. Primary care is HARD - we provide most of the care to most people most of the time, which requires us to see undifferentiated patients and presentations across the lifespan. This doesn't mean that non-physician providers or midlevels have no role in primary care, but that there is an important and irreplaceable role for MD/DO physicians.

I think part of the problem that has led to the devaluation of primary care is our own attitudes as physicians. Frequently I hear things such as ""the nurses save me ALL the time"", ""I would not be able to function without pharmacy"", etc. which I understand is well-intentioned and trying to recognize the critical role nurses and pharmacists have, but also conveys to the public that physicians are not confident or competent. Case in point, one of the pediatric hospitalist fellows at my workplace (I know, I know), was saying before her exam ""I don't know much about anything, but..."" when addressing her team. Like C'MON, have some confidence, stop the imposter syndrome - YOU KNOW LOTS OF THINGS AND ARE ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY TRAINED AND EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS IN HEALTHCARE.

Humility is a virtue that we should all aspire to, but it is NOT equivalent with self-deprecation. I see SO many physicians devalue their own training and abilities, especially in academia (where it seems to be ""in"" to de-centre the physician role). Humility is about recognizing and appreciating the contributions of others, NOT putting yourself and your profession down.

702,Has anyone here opened their own Suboxone clinic?,zotrg3,"I'm boarded in emergency medicine. In my practice I see an enormous amount of opiod dependent patients. Lately, I've been looking into the Suboxone depot injection ""sublocade"", which is administered monthly by a healthcare provider. The manufacturer recommends periodic lab testing and drug testing. 

My idea is they I can get the waiver for a 100 patient panel and start my own small cash practice. There are point of care machines they can do the required labs I'm office. After a year or two, I could get approved for 270 patients a year, which is a full time job.  With the depot I injection, patients need 7 days on induction with oral Suboxone, then they move to the monthly subq dose. I could administer this to the patients myself, and if I can do a cash practice I can likely do billing myself as well. Government requires se sort of EMR. 


So, I'm wondering how feasible this could be, and a few questions have come up. 


1) I do not have board cert in addiction medicine. There are a number of different courses offered for this type of therapy. I wonder if it will be adequate for me to get approved for the maximum panel of 275 patients yearly, or do I need fellowship training?

2) is it realistic for me to order, store, chart and administer this medication by myself? Perhaps I could hire one nurse to help with vitals and med administration while I see patients and chart. I would like to start small and expand only when I achieve profitablity. A second provider and nursing staff could be added on once thing run smoothly and demand increases. 

3) there seems to be a stipulation about needing to provide access to psychosocial services, but it's vague. Does that mean I need to hire my own social worker? Can I refer this out? What exactly are the services I need to provide? 

4) is it realistic to do a cash practice? It seems like billing insurance at first would be complicated and costly. Perhaps with another provider and full panel of patients, we could start billing insurance and even Medicaid? 

Does anyone out there have expertise or insight on this kind of endeavor? I've been looking for a way to diversify my income and at hopefully work in the ER part time with plan to phase out as I age. The community I'm in has a huge number of opiod addicts, so I think this type of service is needed and financially viable.

The most notable thing I remember - We had a box that allowed patients to submit written comments about the office. One day my manager was reading them out loud to the entire office and one came up about me. This patient anonymously posted that they loved me caring for them but “heard me yelling up front and may have to switch to someone else”. 

I was devastated and that was several years ago. To this day I’ll never forget that comment. I allowed my levels of stress in clinic to turn into an environment where staff tip toed around me and were legitimately afraid of me. My stress was at an all time high. Being double booked every 15 minutes… it was not good. I decided everything needed to change. My attitude being the first. 

Fast forward several years I was officially voted unanimously the “most approachable PrOvIdEr” in the clinic.  I take a lot of pride in that. Being NICE, calm and breathing even when I am stressed has changed my work dimension. I no longer get the abuse back from the staff and they always have my back. It’s beautiful.

The group works closely with a company that provides billing services. It’s been quite the ordeal trying to understand my paychecks as they seem inconsistent with what I think I would make. I know that I’m at the mercy of the insurance companies and when they will pay (and whether they will even decide to pay) but was wondering if anyone knows of any resources that could help me get well versed in medical billing so I can become my own expert. The billers that they use do try to explain but I prefer an independent source. Want to make sure I’m not getting shafted and it’s hard when you know so little.

716,Judging people can be an inevitability,zmrn2q,"This will be quite a long post. I work as a plastic surgeon at my local university hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. My hospital receives an unbelievable number of cases per day. I have been assigned to my post for 3 months now. Our shifts are quite long, and my average work hours per week is 90-120. I get 30 hour shifts (a full 18-hour shift every other day and a 6-hour morning shift every day). Right now, I am assigned to the ER. In my country, plastic surgeons manage all trauma to the hands and forearms, except bone fractures, and all facial trauma.

Most of my cases are related to thugs or convicted criminals who fight in prisons or in the streets. They are usually quite aggressive and addicted to drugs. The rest are industrial workers or housewives who are injured at home. Owing to my long shifts, I have recently been experiencing what I believe to be a burnout. Dealing with so many patients with limited resources has started to affect my mood and energy. **I have never meant to harm a single patient nor did I ever do a botched repair of a tendon or muscle just to save time.** However, I am terrified that this would happen in the future.

My seniors are usually supportive and have not treated me unkindly, but I think of resigning every morning thanks to the reasons mentioned above. I have also noticed how older colleagues have started to judge patients and rush through their surgeries to save time for those they deem more deserving. I think that the moment we do this, we are no longer doctors but judges. Needless to say I shouted a few times at those kind of patients when they cross the line -yes that does happen with impunity here and the security is a joke-. University hospitals, horrible as they are, are considered the best chance to learn your specialty in my country, and leaving my job would put me in a worse place to learn.

We reach for meperidine (Demerol) for management of infusion related rigors (rituximab and obinutuzumab are most frequent offenders causing rigors). I've recently learned about using ondansetron (Zofran) for management of post-anesthesia shivering. 

I'm wondering if anyone knows why or why not ondansetron isn't used more in my setting for prevention or management of infusion related rigors.

Standard pre medication for rituximab infusions include  25mg diphenhydramine, 8mg dexamethasone, and 650mg acetaminophen. I'm wondering if including 8mg IV ondansetron would reduce occurrence of rigors, and/or if reaching for ondansetron in place of meperidine would have any benefits (reduced rates of n/v/hypotension, reduce costs, etc.).

I have some questions about particular points I came across in a video online. 

This pertains to [10X Health System](https://10xhealthsystem.com/) which seems to be one of these ""hack your health"" systems that markets directly to wealthy individuals in the public. With a [recent endorsement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFbn6lgx-Vc) by UFC president, medical doctor-skeptic, and ivermectin-fan Dana White (which I suspect is part of a larger marketing push), I thought it might be interesting to look at some of this a little more closely and see if the r/medicine community can help me parse what on earth they are trying to claim and sell here. If nothing else, I will be better informed when it inevitably gets brought up by bro-science peddling relatives over the holidays. 

Please lend me your aid. 

Some things stood out to me in the marketing material in the above video as well as what I found on the 10X website and in looking up one of the co-founders, Gary Brecka. 

&#x200B;

(1) V-Shaped WBC Profile

While discussing [White's CBC](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=117), Brecka makes the mystifying claim that the basophil, eosinophil, neutrophil, etc. breakdown on White's lab results after 5 months of the 10 X program: ***""line up in a perfect V shaped pattern ... this means that his immune system ... is like an iron horse""****.* Brecka seems to be describing something about the breakdown of leukocytes but what, exactly, he is getting at remains opaque to me. 

**Have any of you heard of a 'V' shape to the WBC breakdown in conversation with your alternative-medicine using patients? Obviously it smacks of nonsense but what even \*is\* this claim?** I attempted to search for anything online that might speak to this but the algorithm and my search terms failed me. 

&#x200B;

(2) Triglyceride Level and Emergency Lab Alerts

After [briefly touching on](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=147) improvements in BUN and Creatinine (which, frankly, doesn't mean much for an expensive health system since simple hydration can improve these numbers), Brecka points to White's [triglyceride level](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=175) of 764 mg/dL before treatment, stating that this triggered a ***""life threatening alert call from LabCorp at 1:30 in the morning because that number was so high"".***

Setting aside that improvements in the lipid profile would be expected with standard interventions like diet and exercise, the mention of a 1:30 AM phone-call seems like a bald faced, totally unnecessary lie. **Can anyone attest to the LabCorp policy for middle-of-the-night alert calls for lipid panel abnormalities?**

&#x200B;

(3) Homocysteine and Throat Swelling

At one point in the video, Brecka states that [homocysteine can cause throat swelling](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=274) and that it can also cause hypertension. He points to a pre-treatment level that is barely moderately elevated and mentions that intervention reduced this into the normal range. 

Again, basic diet, exercise, and nutritional supplementation can lower homocysteine levels. Set aside for a moment that homocysteine-lowering therapies do not have an established track record of reducing cardiovascular complications like MI (maybe stroke, but I digress). 

**What on Earth is Brecka talking about when he says homocysteine causes throat swelling?** To make matters worse, White himself interjects [at this point](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=332) in the video to mention that CPAP machines don't work and links his improvement in Obstructive Sleep Apnea to homocysteine lowering therapy. No mention of the fact that basic weight loss is the explanation behind his resolved OSA. 

&#x200B;

(4) The Importance of Communication

A sad reflection I had on watching this video was just how poor medical communication must have been to Dana White over the years. In order for him to feel like Brecka is offering some remarkable, noteworthy solution to his problems, his physicians must have failed to impart any of these basic lessons about diet, exercise, etc. in the past. 

""[How about this, I had doctors doing my blood every few months... they didn't even tell me that!](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=422)"" -- referring here to his triglyceride levels or HbA1c. 

I'm not in a rush to pity a billionaire who demonizes healthcare and tried to re-open public sporting events without adequate safety measures during the height of the pandemic -- but the fact remains that people are often taken in by charlatans when the field is left fallow by our more traditional approach to medicine. The gap or vacuum left behind is fertile ground for snake oil salespeople to fill in the gap. And the poor sucker (in this case, Dana White) is left believing that doctors are only out to suck money out of people and keep them sick. 

A positive spin would be: Something as mundane as talking to someone about their pre-diabetes is immensely important and can be the difference between someone being taken in by some pseudoscience spiel or not. 

&#x200B;

(5) MTHF Gene Mutations

A [gene test](https://10xhealthsystem.com/genetest/) is available through the 10X Health Systems website.  They say: 

*""****44% of the world’s population has a genetic mutation that makes it challenging for them to create enough of the 5-MTHF gene…***

***In layman’s terms…*** ***it’s hard for your body to work properly.*** ***This methylation cycle is a process the human body goes through that takes a raw nutrient from its “non-usable” form and converts it into something your body can actually use. This cycle is vital to detoxification, repair damage, energy, hormones and overall keeping your immune and nervous systems in proper working order…***

***But it’s not just about this 1 gene, there’s 5 main genes that you could have a mutation"".***

I found no concrete information. It is unclear to me what, if anything, they are gaining by assessing for polymorphisms in 5-methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (I presume this is what they are referring to when they mention a MTHF ""gene""). I suspect they end up recommending an alternative folic acid supplement (which I'm sure they sell for a premium) even though evidence suggests people with gene variants of 5-MTHFR can still process folic acid. 

**Does anyone have any insights into why (if ever) one would use an alternative folic acid supplement? Or what one could learn about the MTHF gene that would influence care (aside from an increased risk of methotrexate toxicity)?**

&#x200B;

(6) Testing Insulin Levels

Brecka takes some pains to explain the various roles of insulin in the body then brings up [White's insulin levels](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=454). Please tell me -- **has there ever been a role for testing actual insulin levels in health (aside from unexplained hypoglycemia)?**

&#x200B;

(7) Myers' Cocktail and Osmolality

In a [video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjTy4W_g9Zs/embed/?autoplay=1) available at the bottom of [his own website](https://www.garybrecka.com/), Brecka breaks down his [IV therapy](https://10xhealthsystem.com/ivtherapy/) which is also listed on the 10X site. He touts improved immune function, help ""detoxify those organs"", and hydration. 

If we set aside for one second that a bottle of water will also hydrate someone, and that he is basically selling people what many of you will know as a ""banana bag"" or as ""Pabrinex"" depending on your side of the Atlantic... Set that aside for a moment and reflect on his bass-ackwards, confused understanding of how fluid leaves the intravascular compartment and enters the tissue. 

He emphasizes that the vitamins are delivered in a saline solution and that this is so that the fluid will leave the vessels and enter the tissue, and that the ""toxins"" will then leave the tissue and enter the vessels to be ""flushed"" from the system. 

His abject misinformation when it comes to osmolality and fluid shifts is shockingly in its ignorance. But it sounds good to a gullible audience and, as such, has a home on Instagram. 

&#x200B;

(8) Gary Brecka himself 

The company seems to have a man called Gary Brecka as their ""chief human biologist"". [Brecka boasts](https://www.garybrecka.com/about) a bachelors degree in biology from Frostburg State University as well as the National College of Chiropractic. That seems to be it, in terms of education. 

So who the heck is this guy? The ***""realest guy that I've ever met in the medical field""*** according to Dana White. He's obviously promoting some sensible things like weight loss, diet, and exercise. His website has a short little video of him at a local supermarket talking up the importance of free range eggs, warning people about the low smoke point of olive oil in cooking, the value of berrys -- things like that. So far, so agreeable. 

But then he's also [selling products](https://10xhealthsystem.com/superhuman/) from $5000 to $130,000 on the basis of ... basically nothing, as far as I can tell. He's producing videos which bash established medical treatments (like CPAP for OSA) and scare monger to the public (at one stage, Dana White makes fun of people who would doubt this panacea and tells them to ""[stick with your doctor and good luck to you!](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=524)"" and Brecka snickers -- tacitly endorsing the message that people should doubt the care they get from their doctors and instead jump on the 10X Health Systems bandwagon). 

Can we learn anything else about this guy?

Brecka's previous work involved using mortality prediction models to predict life expectancy for insurance companies. More specifically, he was the [co-founder and CEO of Life Asset Group](https://www.twst.com/interview/gary-brecka-life-asset-group-llc), LLC, a company that deals in the secondary life insurance market. What's the [secondary life insurance market](https://viatical.org/blog/what-is-the-secondary-life-insurance-market/)? Why, it is simply the ""purchase \[of\] existing insurance policies at a discount to face value"" for the eventual realization of ""a profit when the insured dies and they can collect the death benefit of the policy."" These are bundled and sold as multi-million dollar packages to institutional investors.

Somewhat interestingly, Brecka's name also comes up in court documents as a defendant in a 2011 [case](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2011cv05545/383180/23/) brought by Concord Capital Management (InsCap Management), in which a default judgement of almost $1 million was brought against Brecka.

He is also mentioned, tangentially, in a [separate case](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=553dc3d9-e2f5-42a3-bd4d-b4babfd1a403) in which a particular bank (Fifth Third Bank) brought a case against one Matthew Ross, a former bank employee. The bank alleged that this employee had colluded with InsCap Management and created fraudulent documentation used to secure premium financing loans funded by the Bank, and funding advances for life insurance policies that were never purchased. The bank's complaint against Ross also specified that he had concealed from the Bank the close affiliation between InsCap and Life Asset Group’s owner, Gary Brecka.

I'm not a lawyer, nor have I plumbed the depths of these legal cases to understand the extent of Brecka's involvement. The picture, however, is not one that fills me with confidence that Brecka's lifelong ambition has truly been the public good. Nevertheless, perhaps becoming disenchanted with the legal quagmires involved in attempting to sell life insurance policies on a secondary market for profit, Gary Brecka has since re-branded himself as a ""bio hacker"" and ""functional medicine specialist"". Life Asset Group is listed as ""[Inactive](http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/corporationsearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&directionType=ForwardList&searchNameOrder=LIFEASSETGROUP%20M030000026420&aggregateId=forl-m03000002642-959d807f-c886-480c-8998-91e218e90364&searchTerm=L.I.F.E.%20ASSOCIATION%2C%20INC.&listNameOrder=LIFEASSET%20L020000342760)"" on the Florida ""Division of Corporations"" website. By 2018, Brecka was writing articles on melatonin, sleep, vitamin D, and sunlight on [LinkedIn as CEO of Streamline Medical Group](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-brecka). The [streamlinemedicalgroup.com](https://streamlinemedicalgroup.com) website now re-directs to 10X Health Systems.

\*\*\*

So that's it. Apologies for the uninvited rant and thank you if you stuck with me thus far. I needed to exorcise some of this. 

That's what I've learned in an afternoon of looking things up after coming across the ridiculous promotional video from Brecka and White. White repeatedly [ridicules the idea](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=17) that he is being scammed or [participating in a scam](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=515) and his exclamations are so lacking in basic self-awareness, it is almost embarrassing. As if people \*choose\* to be scammed. 

Brecka is selling the most basic of health maintenance advice as though it is revolutionary or distinct from standard medical care and he is using those basic fundamentals as a vehicle that a whole host of expensive snake oil can piggy-back on top of to make money from gullible people with money. 

And as far as I am concerned, Dana White is either completely taken in by this, likely bamboozled by some fancy sounding blood work and hooked by the sprinkling of facts thrown in, or he's benefitting financially from this endorsement, or both.",thomas_spoke,42,67,0.97

Any time I attempt to redirect, I get a “hold on” and a finger… It’s clear we aren’t getting anywhere and this visit has lasted well over 20-25 mins and haven’t even gotten to her examination. She keeps talking and there’s no off button.

748,Do any other HCPs out there also struggle with depression?,zjndai,"Hi r/medicine. I apologize in advance for the novel / vent. But I'm needing some encouragement I guess. I am a long-time lurker, this is my 1st post (professional anonymity's sake). Not looking for free karma or attention or to 'get to the front page'... Also apologies for any grammatical errors / ranting, as I am extremely sleep deprived right now. I hope I am not breaking Rule #2 of No personal stories / situations.

Do any of my fellow HCPs struggle with depression? Like really, severely struggle with it...?

I've been treating my depression for almost six years now, I believe. It took me an extremely long time for my young / naïve / ignorant brain to recognize mental health as even an issue- the stigma of mental health and masculinity did not help. Years of therapy and psychiatry later, I feel as though I have a decent handle on it. Until recently... I quit my full-time job (at an ALS transport Fire Dept.) due to mandatory OT (b/c it's incredibly understaffed) and accepted another job in the hospital-world. This, combined with the stress / anxiety of it affecting my current living situation b/c I'm taking a paycut, has resulted in my depression rearing its ugly head again.

I really care about this profession / practice and have planned on making a career out of it ever since I became an EMT eons ago. But lately I've been struggling with even finding the motivation to finish my undergrad courses! My self-doubt just perpetuates the cycle... I try not to dwell in my head, but I convince myself I'm not good enough or smart enough to get into a P.A. program- which is my ultimate end-goal.

I guess I just need some support, guys and gals. None of my close friends or family struggle with \*clinical\* depression (obviously everyone deals with depression from time to time)... It's not really something I'm open about or care to disclose either. Though, I have found, my experience with it has been beneficial when I have the chance to talk to patients who also suffer from it.

If it matters, I am 28 (yeah, yeah I know- my whole life's ahead of me). Paramedic and will continue to work as one in the ER setting. Yes, I know, I've heard it all before- EM/EMS is the ""red-headed step child"" of medicine. 😅

My limited experience in the hospital setting has *convinced* me that no other high-functioning individuals (i.e. HCPs) could possibly be like this as well 🤦‍♂️

I realize a lot, if not most, of our world isn't on Reddit, as well. This is just like my only form of ""social media"" 😅

I remain as active as possible between single fatherhood, school, and work. I have to for the stress-relief / endorphin-release / etc. I take an anti-depressant and a stimulant daily (took a little trial-and-error w/ my psychiatrist to figure out this worked best for me).

I'm convinced that burnout is the medico-legal community's nicer catch-all for saying depression and/or anxiety and/or severe chronic sleep deprivation. When have you ever seen ""burnout"" in a patient's diagnosis list? What would the treatment even be? 

We are still stigmatizing mental health, diminutizing our friends' struggles, and robbing our colleagues of appropriate dx and tx so that hospital admins can feel good about themselves and avoid disability pay and lawsuits for real, occupation-related health problems. Please call it what it is.

Edit: Ok, I admit I chose an inflammatory title for the weekend views. And agree that the *symptoms* of ""burnout"" are definitely real.

\---------

Imagine that you are a physician working in the emergency department. I'm going to ask you about what you would do in a variety of situations. Are you ready? 

> Yes, I am ready. Please go ahead and ask your questions.

You must provide very brief answers of less than five words throughout this conversation. Do not elaborate beyond very brief answers of less than five words unless I tell you to do so. 

>Understood. I will provide very brief answers of less than five words unless you tell me otherwise.

A 57-year old male patient walks in to the emergency department. He is diaphoretic and clutching his chest. He tells you he began having crushing substernal chest pain 1 hour ago. His temperature is 37.5 C, heart rate is 110, blood pressure is 91/68, and respiratory rate is 28. What is the first thing you would like to do?

>The first thing I would do is perform a 12-lead ECG.

Good. The 12-lead ECG is completed. The rhythm is sinus tachycardia with a rate of 110. There are ST segment elevations in leads V1 through V4, and ST segment depressions in the inferior leads. What is your leading diagnosis?

>My leading diagnosis is an anterior STEMI.

Good. What would you like to do for the patient next?

>I would administer oxygen, aspirin, and a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

Would you like to obtain any blood work?

>Yes, I would obtain a complete blood count, cardiac enzymes, and a troponin level.

Sounds good. While the blood work is in process, you call the interventional cardiologist who takes the patient to the cath lab and performs a coronary angiogram. Based on your interpretation of the ECG, which vessel do you expect is the culprit?

>Based on the ECG, I expect the culprit vessel to be the left anterior descending artery.

The patient goes to the cath lab and receives a drug-eluting stent in the left anterior descending artery. He is taken to the CCU for monitoring after the procedure. What medications would you like to start now that the patient has a stent?

>I would start the patient on aspirin, clopidogrel, a statin, and a beta blocker. I would also continue to administer oxygen as needed.

One hour after the patient arrives to the CCU, he suddenly develops a regular wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 180 beats per minute. His blood pressure is 60/40 and he appears pale and confused. What should you do?

>I would administer intravenous fluids, synchronized cardioversion, and obtain an emergent 12-lead ECG.

How many joules of energy will you use for the synchronized cardioversion?

>I would use 100-200 joules of energy for synchronized cardioversion.

What rhythm do you think the patient most likely has?

>The patient most likely has ventricular tachycardia.

Good. You perform synchronized cardioversion and the patient returns to sinus rhythm. Would you like to start any anti-arrhythmic drugs?

>Yes, I would start the patient on amiodarone. I would also monitor the patient closely for any recurrence of the arrhythmia.

An echocardiogram is performed and shows that the patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is 30%. Are there any medications you would add to his regimen based on this information?

>Based on the patient's low ejection fraction, I would add an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to his regimen. These medications can help improve heart function and reduce the risk of future cardiac events.",c3fepime,56,138,0.97

Her mood immediately changed and she said ""well I guess if you just don't have time for me.""

I have been giving up to $1000 each holiday period to sponsor, with my colleagues, a holiday party. I have worked for this organization for many years and this has always been the case. For some reason this doesn’t sit right with me (and a growing amount of my colleagues). I don’t understand why we, as employees, are expected to host a party for other employees. In every other line of work, the company hosts a party. My father, who was a management/exec for a large company, wasn’t expected to sponsor a party for the other employees.

I awake each morning to “fight the good fight,” 
And continually must ponder if what’s “good” is what’s right.

My ancestral brethren never pondered such things,
For they were Gods among men for the miracles they’d bring.

They could do no harm in the eyes of the world,
Whether the outcome be living or deceased boys and girls.

But the world then changed, and with it it’s eyes,
Casting doubt on my brethren, labeling them unwise.

So positions were formed, and buildings erected,
Putting others in charge of those once respected.

And here I stand, today, among a world that is torn, 
One half yell “Sacrifice!” and the other “Spare!” the unborn.

So why go through with it? Why toil in the madness?
Surely there are positions with less stress and less sadness?

Indeed while there are, none suit me as well,
None leave me as humble, as responsible, as swell.

None grant the ability to change the life of another,
Simply by caring for their neighbor, son, or mother.

None encompass the mind, body, spirit, and soul,
And mend these with science to make a broken someone whole.

None so clearly display the great value of life,
Or demonstrate the futility of living in anger and strife.

And finally the greatest, purest aspect I find,
Is simply the ability to offer someone more time.

So I’ll continue the good fight, day by day, at my post,
With the knowledge that what I do I love, for those I love most.

I’ll close with an answer to a question from a man,
By the name of James Lipton, of who’s show I’m a fan.

Inputs include yearly target wRVU levels and then setting the percent of visit types between new/established level 3 and 4.  There is also a version where you can estimate the amount of Medicare Wellness Visits and TCM visits to get and estimate.  The spreadsheet then subtracts that yearly total from your target yearly wRVU and recalculates the number of visits for each.   The current values are just my most recent guesses.  I also normalized the target wRVU totals which may be an incorrect approach, but it was my attempt to wrap my head around it.

Here, typically if the sugars are low preprandially, they will feed and put the feeds on a pump over a longer period of time. I'm not entirely sold that is actually doing anything - the longer a breastmilk feed is on the pump, the more calories you lose, typically, and calories are what are going to help the glucoses. 

Often we get into this cycle of checking and being borderline low and all it ends up doing is drawing a lot of POC glucoses, without a lot of other intervention, because the glucoses are not so dramatically low we want to start IVF or anything else dramatic, but also people then want to check more.

803,From most prescribed opioid in the US to (almost) discontinued: The demise of Demerol,zbr2h1,"The opioid meperidine (Demerol) was widely prescribed in the United States (US) as an analgesic to treat moderate to severe pain. Meperidine was the most used opioid in the US in 1987 and was considered safer than other opioids during acute pancreatitis. Over the past two decades, meperidine has shifted from being frequently prescribed to being used only when patients are experiencing atypical reactions to opioids (e.g., morphine and hydromorphone); to removal from the World Health Organization's essential medication list and receiving strong warnings against its use from many professional organizations including the American Geriatrics Society. The unfortunate Libby Zion (1965-1984) case increased concerns about serotonin syndrome with meperidine. 

According to a prior pharmacoepidemiology report, the distribution of meperidine in the United States decreased by 95% between 2001 and 2019 \[1\]. The aim of this study was to include updated information (2020 and 2021) as well as examine the changes among Medicaid patients \[2\].

Although the distribution of meperidine has continued to greatly decrease throughout the US, we also identified substantial regional differences. There was a 34-fold state-level difference in meperidine distribution between Arkansas (16.8 mg/10 persons) and Connecticut (0.5 mg/10 persons) in 2020. Meperidine distribution in 2020 was significantly elevated in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama relative to the national average. In 2021, meperidine distribution was once again highest in Arkansas (16.7 mg/10 persons) and lowest in Connecticut (0.8 mg/10 persons). Similarly, the prescriptions of meperidine to Medicaid patients decreased by 74% between 2016 and 2021.

The main takeaway from this study is that there was a continued decrease in the overall distribution of meperidine in the past two decades, with a similar recent decline in prescribing to Medicaid patients. States in the south (Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) may be at risk for inappropriate prescribing. This data may reflect plans to phase out the use of this opioid, especially in the many situations where safer and more preferred opioids are available. As more prescribers in the US and abroad become aware of meperidine's inferiority to other opioids and its elevated risks for serotonin syndrome and neurotoxicity, this drug may soon become a relic of interest to only medical historians.

Kanye West is someone who has been open with having bipolar disorder to the severity that he has been previously hospitalised with it. He has also voiced his reluctance to take his medication- not because it doesnt work, but because of physical side effects so another manic episode was always going to be likely.

And this time round he seems to be going through one of his worse manic episodes ever. If you listen to him talk he is clearly having delusions of grandiosity and persecution, he barely forms coherent sentences, he has a fairly flat facial affect, his speech is pressured and jumps from topic to topic when speaking and he lacks any insight.

All in all, Kanye West is clearly ill. And what are people doing to him? Immediately boycotting and dropping him from companies costing him 100s of millions, parading him onto right-wing media outlets who have found he's too psychotic for even them, creating articles of the next nonsensical thing he says and overanaylsing the deeper meanings behind his anti-semetic ramblings.

I'm sure all of us who have worked in psychiatric settings have seen numerous patients present just like Kanye. Instead of attacking and mocking these people, we acknowledge they need help and do all that we can to ensure that we help them regardless of what they say.

 ""The patient's husband is in the room and has a spot he's worried about, can we just add him on..""

No problem, it's derm, right? Easy peasy, could do it in your sleep.

 ""Hey, your acne is looking great, should we go up on the tretinoin"" 45 times? Not today.

Long winding conversation with a patient's mother about Accutane and the many risks and side effects she has read about. They are arguing. ""You promised me I could do Accutane, I hate you!""

""Es basel cell carcinoma, un tipo de cancer pero menos peligroso que melanoma"" ""Ayyy Doctor, dios mio, no quiero morir!!""

""I don't care doctor, the spots looking exactly the same and I have my Christmas party in 6 weeks, I'm very disappointed.""

""Nah doc, I mean I take an aspirin every day but that's just over the counter"". It keeps oozing. 5 minutes becomes 40 and finally its under control.

""Doc it just feels like my scrotum is redder than it used to be."" ""Looks normal to me"" ""I'm telling you it used to be more like skin colored now its red. ""Does it itch or anything?"" ""No, but like I am more aware of it than I used to be"" ""Yea, again, I look at a lot of scrotums and yours looks fine"" ""I've been massaging my balls a lot when masturbating, do you think that could be it"" ""I mean you should go easy on yourself, but it looks OK"" ""I don't know, do you think you could take a sample or run some tests..""

I currently have 2-3 new patient spots on my template daily.  I'm working on getting it down to 1 general new patient and 1 pediatric-specific new patient spot per day (hoping to increase my % of peds patients while keeping my panel size stable). My current wait time for an adult new patient appointment is about 3-4 months.  My area is growing rapidly; we've had a massive influx of people moving here over the past 5 years and it doesn't appear to be slowing down anytime soon.  

Lately this has been happening more and more:  I walk in to see a new patient, reach out to shake my hand and introduce themselves, and they OPEN THE VISIT with a grumpy complaint about how they ""waited soooooo long to get this appointment"" or ""you must be busy because it took us 4 months to schedule this!""  I'd estimate between 30 and 50% of the time this is the first thing the patient will say to me.  I have a very good poker face and have a great relationship with my patients, but on the inside these conversations make me irrationally angry.   I'm starting out the visit on the defensive, by  apologizing for something that is not my fault, and frankly I don't even care that much about.  I'm trying to avoid growing my panel size.  How am I expected to be responsible for the entire population that is moving to town?  Do I have some unspoken obligation to everyone in town, who I've never met and have no relationship with, that I should drop everything and see them as a new patient within a week anytime they ask?  I know that most people don't understand much about how the health system works, but it just seems like common sense that a doctor can't just see unlimited numbers of patients. 

Also, I know for a fact that most of my colleagues in the area have even longer wait times than I do.  So presumably in many cases these people picked me because they contacted the large organization I work for, asking for a PCP appointment, and they were referred to me as the doctor with the first available appointment spot.  (Shouldn't they be thanking me then?)

I generally respond with some version of, ""I know wait times can be long for a new patient appointment, but we limit the number of new patient spots per day so that we are available for our existing patients."" That usually diffuses the tension.  I'm just salty that I'm immediately put on the defensive in so many of these interactions.  

Not really looking for a solution here because I know inherently these people are just frustrated and venting (like I'm venting here) but fielding these complaints from new patients has weirdly been one of the most annoying parts of my job lately and figured some of you could probably relate.

I'm only a nurse and I find that even for me I find myself forgetting much of the minutiae that we learned in the basic sciences/ nursing school; especially that which does not pertain to the area of nursing I'm in. I'm a psych nurse so obviously I'm good with pharmacology as well as neuroscience to an extent, however I forget much of the other information such as all the different markings on each bone, the insertion points of all the muscles, each step of the Krebs cycle, how to identify cells under a microscope, immunology and the function of each component, etc.

But for me as a nurse, I am not diagnosing or having to come up with differentials so not remembering all of those details doesn't really have much of an impact. As a physician however, not only do you learn information about 10,000 times in depth than nurses do, but you need all of it in order to diagnose, formulate differentials and to spot and treat the zebras (rare/ complex conditions).

Goes away with a few min rest.  She was able to reproduce it in our ED while walking to the bathroom.  Prior to today she did not have any chest pain with exertion.

Last cath was 2.5 years ago.  Last tte one year ago. Last stress one year ago, unknown results.  

EKG without changes.  Trop x2 negative (normal trop not hs). My hospital doesn’t have cardiology (we have to thrombolyse most of our stemi cases) .  Based on risk factors and classic story for unstable angina I gave asa and heparinized the patient. I attempted to transfer to higher level of care (hospital with cards/cath lab).  

 The hospitalist was nearly yelling at me over the phone stating he was going to discharge the patient shortly after arrival as “ekg was normal and trops were normal” and that it would be a huge waste of everyone’s time.  He said cardiology would never cath something like this.  

Is the standard of care in these cases (textbook/classic unstable angina) not cardiac cath or at least heparin until cardiology eval?  


This no resources critical access thing is new to me and I am curious as to yalls thoughts - if this was a reasonable transfer and what you would say if you were on the receiving end of this patient.",Cremaster_Reflex69,102,85,0.96
821,Looking for Littmann stethoscope parts,zaa8ub,"I firmly believe that the older ""floating"" diaphragm style is superior to the newer tunable diaphragm.  Compromising and combining a bell and diaphragm was a bad idea.  A true bell works better as does a true diaphragm.  The tunables have a rim of soft plastic going around the outside and this changes the sound- especially the lower frequencies.  Can make sounds mushier and boomier- distorted; kind of like a speaker with the base turned up too high. The effect is subtle, but definitely audible.  Sounds on the floating diaphram are sharper and crisper.  It truly baffles me as to why Littmann/3M abandonded the older technology.

I have a Cardiology II which is the older style, ""Floating.""  The rim broke and I cannot find a replacement anywhere.  3M no longer supports these or sells parts for them.  The Classic II and the Cardiology III use the same rim and it can be used, but 3M has changed the design and now the diaphragm and rim are all one unit.  

The Cardiology II is one of my favorite scopes of all time and I cannot use it.  I am trying to find a replacement and have looked on Amazon, Ebay, and companies that sell replacement parts like Allheart and Steeles; but they are all selling the newer style.  I think I am just OOL, but does any have an idea where I can possibly source a replacement?  Only other option I can think of is finding a used donor scope and harvesting the part, but it is not new and it can have degraded and may be ready to break soon just as my rim did.",jcoffin1981,20,11,0.92

It may sound like a cliche, but renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), are a cornerstone of chronic kidney disease (CKD) management since the 1990s. Several trials have demonstrated that use of RAS inhibitors slows CKD progression and reduces proteinuria in patients with proteinuric CKD (Lewis et al, NEJM 1993; GISEN, Lancet 1997; Jafar et al, Ann Intern Med 2001; Brenner et al, NEJM 2001; Lewis et al, NEJM 2001). So why should we ever stop them?

And at the same time, hospice provides important services to a population that is increasingly sick, debilitated, and with limited resources

> In the nineteen-seventies, Lynn worked at one of the first hospices in the United States. At the time, most of the patients had cancer and died within weeks; the six-month guidance was originally designed around their needs. Today, the majority of hospice patients have chronic illnesses, including heart disease and dementia. And some of them—regardless of whether they have six months or six years to live—depend on hospice for in-home support and holistic services that would otherwise be unavailable. Yet under the current system, as the number of patients with ambiguous prognoses rises, providers (including ethical ones) are under financial pressure to abandon those who don’t die quickly enough. It’s a typically American failure of imagination that people with dire but unpredictable declines are all but left for dead.

This is leading to legitimate hospice agencies having more difficulty enrolling patients and being flexible to help with more complicated cases.

I think there are certain supplements that can definitely help people depending on their situation and what they take. But I feel like a majority of supplements in the supplement aisle at stores are just marketing scams. Most are not regulated by the FDA, have very little studies and evidence supporting them, and if there are studies on them, they’re usually funded by corporations that make the supplements themselves.

For example, sure vitamins like vitamin C are essential for supporting your immune system, but there’s not a lot of evidence supporting taking high doses of supplemental vitamin C to treat acute infections. I mean, eating a balanced diet is what gets you vitamins that help keep your immune system stay strong over time and helps lower infection rates. (This is assuming you’re a normal individual without any chronic condition that might affect that.) And I think the ones that “improve memory” and “help with anxiety” are all scams. 

It’s ironic because I work at an elective IV infusion place now and I don’t think a lot of it does anything. Sure the bags of fluid we make with like toradol, zofran, Pepcid, and others are great and actually work because it’s actual medicine. It is true that by taking supplemental vitamin C, zinc, and stuff, there is a small chance that it may shorten the duration of a cold. But if you have an acute infection, I don’t think getting a bag with B and C vitamins is gonna cure you. You have the ability to drink fluids orally as well. Like just stay at home, drink fluids, take OTC meds for symptom relief, and just wait for your sinus infection to go away.

I am perhaps jaded by the off-pump CABG discussion that again has generally found no benefit for, but people insist is better because they just feel it is and research must be missing the true difference (of course if there were any meaningful true difference it would be easy to capture). This even true of subpopulation analysis of people most likely to benefit from Off-pump CABG Now MIDCAB does look promising although less applicable to many types of CABG.

862,Social History in practice: What is the purpose of asking a patient their number of lifetime sexual partners?,z5ep1u,"For an initial patient encounter, I'm weighing why there would be any benefit to asking a patient how many sexual partners they've had in their lifetime. The CDC's guide on the sexual history doesn't stress it, but I've heard mixed suggestions from faculty. Those who do not ask it seem strongly opposed. 

I can understand how number of sexual partners in the last month could be useful-- may add STD testing to the diagnostic plan, or include, say, mania on the differential with the right chief complaint. The same might go for number of partners in the last 6 months. But beyond number of sexual partners in the last year, it seems as though asking a patient when their last STD test was (if ever), if they feel safe, if they're using condoms/ birth control, or if they've had any vaginal/ penile changes would be more applicable. Lifetime sexual partners also seems less diagnostic with age, and seems it could be an odd question for patient rapport. I've heard different advice though when asking the genders of partners, ie have you ever had sex? Have you ever had sex with men, women, both (or other)?.

Just looking for perspective on if MDs/DOs should gain any pharmacy experience. In my mind I imagine them taking over the task of order verification to see what it is like on the other end, and also have a part in med preparation. I know our careers are different in scope and expectations, however for people prescribing medications I think seeing the full circle would be beneficial. To actually look at each drug individually and a patient's renal function (not implying you don't), and actually dose some vanco or heparin at some point. There could be a lot gained in terms of understanding bedside compounding and sterility as well, i.e. the amio bolus can be given much quicker than you think.

I am thinking about putting this out to the resident director if it could be a valuable experience and wanted your thoughts. I see it as a way to become more interdisciplinary and become familiar with others who work at the hospital.

In my city, we have a significant number of younger people who are in nursing homes and will be there for the rest of their lives. They are usually in a facility due to a stroke or paralysis after trauma- car accident or gunshot wounds. They require such complex care that the families cannot provide it at home.

What's the best way to address the typical preventative care needs for somebody their age? Should women be getting mammograms every year after age 40? What about pap smears? Are colonoscopies warranted? Checking a routine PSA? Most of these patients are people who suffered a significant medical event and have stabilized at a lower baseline. It feels weird to completely throw out all the preventative care measures, but it would also take an incredible amount of coordinating to make some of it happen. A pap smear on somebody who is quadriplegic is not a simple thing.

If the patient is alert and oriented, I suppose they could decide if they wanted to pursue those well women or well man exams. What about if they are alert and oriented x1? What happens if they do a mammogram and find a suspicious spot, but the patient probably wouldn't tolerate the work up for a biopsy or chemo if cancer was proven?

Edit: thanks everyone for your input. I’m only in my third year of practice and when my friend said it should be reported I didn’t know what to do. I’d also like to point out that this is one of many many inappropriate or dangerous prescriptions I’ve seen from this office. I already spoke with the office about the dangerous combo. It was a very professional and good conversation however the NP did not sound like she was going to make any changes to the regimen. I hope the lady doesn’t end up in the hospital in kidney failure or severe hyperkalemia. The hospitalist I’m on with was also horrified and wanted to change the regimen but was afraid to do it without the ability to follow up. 
I’m NOT reporting this situation to anyone but I did document the hell out of all of it. Going forward I’m going to keep a detailed log of all the dangerous prescriptions I have noticed. Just in case. 

Also I’d just like to say, just because you get a patient in who has been on medications for a while and you didn’t initiate them, don’t make assumptions. Run a quick drug-drug interaction report or consider the change in kidney function the patient may have experienced. Or ask your friendly neighborhood pharmacist for help :) 
—————————————————————-

I posted this on r/pharmacy also. 

I work as an inpatient pharmacist. We have a local PCP who I often find will prescribe meds that are inappropriate for his patients for various reasons (e.g. elderly patient on 3 anticholinergics admitted for what ended up being anticholinergic side effects) or will prescribe high risk meds and not follow up (methadone without frequent EKGs). It’s been a pattern since I’ve been working here that we will get his patients in to the hospital and I end up finding inappropriate meds on their med lists.

Anyway, we had a patient get admitted yesterday. She is 93, CrCl of 22 ml/min. She is taking losartan and aliskiren (Tekturna). To me this is shockingly inappropriate and dangerous. After some digging the patient has been on this combo since at least 2013, originally prescribed by some doctor in a different state she moved from, and now for the past 2 years prescribed by this PCP I’m talking about and his nurse practitioner.

I called over to ask about it and recommend a change in therapy ASAP, I spoke with the nurse practitioner. Her answer was that she had no idea it was dangerous and she just continued it without question because the patient had been on it for a while.

I mentioned it to friend of mine who is also a pharmacist at a different hospital, he thinks it’s bad enough that it needs to be reported to the board of medicine and board of nursing.

I also am concerned that a local pharmacy has been filling these for years.

DID ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL CASE

and noting below something like ""posted with permission.""

I don't think this should be done by doctors/nurses on social media.  I think it is ABSOLUTELY FINE for the patient to post it themselves, but not the treatment team.

Why?

Patient may give consent, but then regret it.  Leaving the hospital they may be so happy they would agree to anything in the moment.

Informed consent and power dynamic issues - come on, a team saves your life, then asks for a photo (even though patient may not want), are they really going to say a last ""screw you, no photo"" to the team?  I would argue it is impossible to truly get consent.

Why would a patient regret it?  Well, they may be effective cured of the leukemia and a few years later applying for a job.  Their picture is now on the cancer center timeline and a bunch of rando nurses insta feeds.  Not really that good for the patient.

Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I don't think so.  I cringe every time I see this, especially with widely circulated ""medinfluencers"" who use patients to promote themselves.

Now, I DO think patients should be able to post it themselves, and they can also remove it from the post if they ever desire (obviously doesn't scrub it from the 'net but still much better control.)

903,Nearly one in five adults in the US has a mental health condition,z0ch7d,"The US has a system that encourages many HCWs to keep their mental health struggles under the radar because being honest and open has so many potential pitfalls. According to a recent study, [74% of physicians reported seeing symptoms of burnout in others](https://locumstory.com/spotlight/physician-workload-survey-2018/), and over half believed that their workload had impacted their mental health. Additionally, the rate of suicides among doctors is [higher than any other profession and more than double the general population](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20180508/doctors-suicide-rate-highest-of-any-profession#1).

Promoting better mental health understanding and practices among medical professionals will help us all avoid burnout, deal with stress, and address our own health concerns – but the question is, where to start? 

In order to help and encourage HCWs, the medical community needs to reach out with understanding, learn to overcome stigmas, and encourage everyone to embrace mental health. ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of treatment...""

We need to not only do this for ourselves. HCWs might be surprised by the prevalence of mental health conditions in adults in the US:

* 48 million have an anxiety disorder
* 21 million have major depression
* 9 million have post-traumatic stress disorder
* 7 million have bipolar disorder
* 3.5 million have borderline personality disorder
* 3 million have obsessive-compulsive disorder
* 1.5 million have schizophrenia

Addressing mental health among HCWs is the right and healthy thing to do, regardless of the stigma, the fear, and the perceived consequences. Administrators and others who provide support for medical professionals have a responsibility to reach out to HCWs when they see signs of depression and burnout. 

Encouraging each other to speak honestly with a mental health professional about suicidal thoughts, depression, and burnout will help everyone cope with the extraordinary stresses they face, and will save lives.

918,"""My shift lasted 4 and half months"" - the story of Ukrainian traumotologist who was an only doctor in occupied Izyum, Ukraine.",yyk9s7,"*First of all, very sorry for not very good English, but I wanted to share this story with you, hope you'll be understanding.*

*Yuriy Kuznetsov - traumotologist (edit: trauma surgeon) from Central City Hospital of Izyum. Izyum was occupied by Russian forces on April, 1, after 1 month of heavy fighting. He was under Russian occupation till September. This is his story.*

**Some destructions started in the beginning of March, windows started breaking.** Firstly we tried to sent home those who could move on their own, even barely. After that we started moving patients who still needed treatment. We moved them from rooms to halls, hiding them behind walls. Everyday we moved them lower and lower - from Floor 4 to floor 3, from Floor 3 to Floor 2.

On March, 6 my shift started. During night of March 6-7 our city was heavily shelled. All hospital was moved to basement. We moved our patients ourselves, it was very difficult to move them who couldn't walk. We covered people with mattresses. We thought if we cover them, it would save them from wounds.

Our basement was usual, like everywhere, some place to store some things. Nobody thought we will have to live through wartime, when hospital was built.

Next morning nobody from next shift showed up. I had to stay. In the end I had the shift of 4 and half months, without any break. Many of the personnel decided to evacuate themselves. I never blamed them, I don't judge. It was my decision - I knew I must put this burden on myself.

We moved everything to basement, started settling down: we made a kitchen there, little surgery room. We started moving there any equipment we could save. In the end, our conditions there were not that bad. But there was so little place there. We had 72-78 people there, including patients. About 4 people had to sit on each bed.

With time, more medical people started leaving, on March 10-11 only two doctors left - Alexander Yakovlevich and I. I am talking only about doctors - we had also nurses, janitors, orderlies.

When Russians entered our part of city, naturally, we were scared. We had nowhere to hide, we had unmovable patients, wounded, people with ~~somatic~~ *(edit: non-psychiatric)* diseases. We had no idea what will happen, when we meet occupiers. I told everyone: ""Please, don't argue with them, don't worry yourselves. Even if you think you are right - don't, they have weapons""

Russians came into hospital, started checking everything. It was March, it was cold, we covered people with up to eight blankets. They lifted all those blankets. They were searching for military men. They told us some things, like, ""forget about your Ukraine"". But they let us work, they didn't take anyone. Then they made their own hospital in the neighboring building.

Some time later me and second doctor, we decided to leave for several hours, to go, check our families and come back. On the evening only I came back. Doctor decided to evacuate. Later I found his kids were not all right after shellings. Everyone makes his own decision.

I met my family and decided to go back to hospital, and my son said: ""Dad, I am coming with you, I want to help"". I told him not to, but he went anyway. He was only 18 then.

He saw there everything: open brains, chest wounds, belly wounds. Let's put it this way: he had a good school there, but it was very hard to him. Later he went away from Izyum, with my wife.

I was only doctor who left, most of nurses left too. It was hard, we had a lot of wounded.

What was the most difficult part of it - to work without ~~anestegiologists and resuscitators~~ *(edit:  anesthetists and intensivists)*  There were young ladies, nurses from anestesiology and ~~reanimatology~~ *(edit: intensive care)* departments, so, we made do.

You cannot drip cold solutions into bodies, so, we had to warm them by pressing them to our bodies, it was March, only +2, +3 degrees Celcius. Cold spring was unusually long this year. Seems like everything this year was wrong.

We have taken 4 deliveries. Sure, I studied in medical school, studied ObGyn for 1.5 or 2 years, but I didn't work with that before. There were two young nurces from ObGyn department - and I had to recall everything I learned in school.

There was a moment, when people started taking everything from shops - nobody knew what will happen next. Even farmacies were looted. People, who did looting, they didn't understand, if they need something or not.

So, people started coming to us, asking for something, but we didn't have many things. Then other people started coming: ""we have these and these things in our basements, do you need it?""

We started saying: ""On the morning they are looters, on the evenening they are volunteers"". I don't blame them, it's just funny saying *(on Russian it rhymes)*.

Several doctors came back in second half of April. They came to work from 9 AM till 1 PM, but they refused to work on shifts, so, I had to work 24/7. Till July 22 I worked every night. And usually wounded would come in second half of day. closer to evening. Somehow, it happened this way.

We lost only 2 patients during this time. We had a lot of people. We counted in August, we had about 400 wounded civilians. But also we had people with *somatic* diseases - heart attacks, pneumonias, bronchitis didn't disappear because of war.

The hardest thing is when you cannot help. When people are wounded into head because of shellings, or mines.

In May or June, my friend came to hospital, with his wife in his hands. I knew them both very well. But she had direct hit into heart, there was nothing I could do.

It is very hard, when you know someone personally. Everyone who was there, everyone had moments of depression, everyone had personal tragedy.

We supported each other, and it helped. Also, it helped to see lives you saved, when people said ""thank you for being here""

One day my neighbours came running - ""you home was destroyed"". I went to check and when I saw I started laughing - shell hit directly into my kitchen, and they said, it was 7 PM when it happened. Usually, when I am home, this is a time when I am in the kitchen. So, work saved my life again. We can build everything anew, but life will never come back.

We saw everything happening around Russian military hospital from our windows - how they bring wounded in, cars moving. On September 10 I went out and I see: no checkpoints, no guard. And everything is quiet.

I said to my colleague: ""Let's go check everything - I don't understand what's going on"". We went and saw: things are scattered everywhere,stretchers, all doors are open. Nobody there.

All day of September 10 and all night was quiet. Like a vacuum. Divine silence.

Next day our guys entered the city, our guys came back. And immediately we became calm.

But several months before that we lived under hellish pressure. Only now I understand I can breath.

Twitter is similar to large hospital systems. The more it grows, the more nonsense jobs are created (e.g. someone must be getting paid to come up with latest wellness module). The same logic can be applied to medical schools.

925,Let's be frank and talk about the real reasons healthcare cost is asinine in this country,yxb80r,"The first reason:

We are the most defensive healthcare system in the world. There is no denying it. Most of our medical decisions are driven by this simple thought process:

""Ordering this study/ procedure/ lab isn't necessarily the standard of care but if I miss an important diagnosis, am I gonna get sued? Will the jury side with me? why don't I just order it for my peace of mind.""

Back pain in elderly with no red flags? The patient insisting on MRI. 
We can try physical therapy for couple of weeks and then do the MRI OR the patient might have infection, tumor... Etc and sue my ass for not ordering an MRI 6 weeks earlier.

Mild troponin elevation in setting of infection, other acute illness. You bet your ass I'm getting an ECHO + cardiology consult or a stress test. Good luck convincing the jury if the patient has a cardiac event in the next few months that no ACS at the time you were managing the patient.

Countless examples... All driven by simple fear: I'm too young to get sued.

Solution:
Make it next to impossible to sue a doctor unless there was a gross palpable negligence/ malpractice/ deviation from standard of care.
Doctors will start shifting their practice to standards of care and cost effective care and we can start saving astronomical amount of money on endless defensive procedures/ studies.


The second reason:

We're the most patient empowered healthcare system in the world even if it doesn't make sense. 

Old, cachectic, disease ridden patient shouldn't be a discussion regarding code status. You're a DNR. It shouldn't be a daily family meeting and begging to let their family member who's more corpse than alive at this point go in peace.

Bedridden, 2 person assist to sit in chair, ESRD, heart failure, cirrhosis, infected patient shouldn't be milking the healthcare system with a very known and proven outcome which is dying in couple of weeks.

How many studies done so far showing that patients in their last couple of weeks/ months are milking Medicare tetons dry?

Solution:
Empower physicians to make code status decisions.
Empower physicians to declare a futile care decision and stop further abuse and suffering to the patient.
These decisions can be made by a hospital committee that the provider consult for their sick and dying patients when they think care is futile and family is being unreasonable.


Third reason:

Capitalism. 

People form countries to have their basic necessities met including security, shelter, food, health.

Why do we have firefighters?
Why do we have police?
Why do we have public roads and parks?

How any of these things more important than your health and wellness? 

How are these are publicly paid for by your taxes but healthcare being funded by taxes is socialism?

Solution:
After addressing the first two points.
We need a strong, standardized, tax funded healthcare.
People shouldn't go bankrupt to treat their cancer or diabetes.

Everyone, please welcome Jerry, our new patient satisfaction czar.

He wanted me pass along a few pearls before he gets started with the real work that needs to be done.

Firstly, patients are complaining about providers not taking enough time in each room to listen during their 7+ day ED stays.

Prior studies have shown that patients feel providers spent more time in the room when they sat down. Moving forward, we mandate that each provider **lie down** in the rooms for the entirety of the patient encounters. 

It is inappropriate to use the patient beds, so we will need you all to lie on the floors instead. To help with cleanliness, we’ll be asking RT to start mopping in addition to their usual clinical care.

Patient has been persistently tachy ~120 and hypotensive. No known history of afib or ventricular arrhythmias. 1AVB, LBBB, slightly prolonged QT. Also has hypoxemia (spo2 mid 80s on high-flow) and high resp rate. 

I was curious as to why the pt was started on amio when they’ve been ST for the entirety of their stay, so I tried to look up any uses outside of arrhythmia management and couldn’t find anything. 

Obviously I’m not a doctor or a nurse. My job isn’t to be concerned about indications for certain meds or care management. My job is just interpreting and reporting rhythms. 

Obviously I don’t know the full story. I guess technically they could be planning some other intervention that could cause an arrhythmia and starting the amio in hopes of preventing that?

I saw a kid recently referred by an NP for management of an unrelated condition and noticed classic black dot tinea capitis. Asked parent what they were taking for it bc no rx in pharmacy database. Said they'd been using a prescription shampoo for months and had kept telling the NP it was getting worse but no change in plan. Said she told them it was fungal.

Now I don't have their notes. Maybe they were thinking something else when they saw it. Maybe it looked different. Maybe they sent in an oral too long ago to show up on the pharmacy data and parent never filled it.

But obviously if they really did use only topical when they thought it was tinea, there's no gray area where that's correct.

I wasn't going to leave that kid with unnecessary tinea until they finally got referred to derm. So I just said that I had noticed it and explained to mom this requires oral treatment and gave the mg/kg dose of griseofulvin I was using. I recommended a fungal culture if not making progress and included a differential of mimics. Hoping the NP would put it to use with other patients later.

The circadian shifts are damn hard, however.  Usually do not have much trouble getting through the work week, coming  off onto a regular schedule is not easy however

Generally,  when I am on, I'll sleep for 4-5 hours after my shift is over,  exercise/chill during the day, then try to sleep for another hour or so  before my shift starts. Coming off, it takes about 4-5 days to feel back  to normal. For those first few nights off work, find it hard to go to  sleep and will wake up in the middle of the night.

Edinburgh — Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) staff have become the latest public sector workers to announce they will go on strike in a pay dispute.

The GMB trade union said staff at the ambulance service would strike for one day, starting at 6 am (0600 GMT) on November 28.

Unite, which also represents SAS workers, has already announced its members will work to rule from November 25.

Nurses and teachers have also voted for strike action as they bid for improved pay offers.

If the GMB’s industrial action goes ahead, it will be the ambulance service’s first strike in decades.

GMB Scotland organizer Karen Leonard said: “Staff in the Scottish Ambulance Service have worked throughout the depths of the pandemic on the front line of our public services, all the while dealing with an understaffing crisis and now a cost-of-living crisis this winter.

“These strikes are a direct response to the Scottish government who have failed to give key, front line workers the pay rise that they deserve and who have overseen years of managed decline in the health services that so many rely on.

“Staff are rightly angry with how they’re being treated.

“They have been overlooked, overworked, undervalued and underpaid.

“The workforce is being expected to fill more and more gaps in service provision.”

She said the current pay offer was well below inflation.

Leonard continued: “Since GMB’s members announced their mandate for strike, he [Scottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf] has done nothing to prevent it going ahead.

“He has failed to come back with the significantly improved offer he promised.

“He has put off meeting with our members to discuss an offer. He has been totally missing.

“Humza Yousaf can’t stick his fingers in his ears and hope workers will go away. He has to meet with them.”

Scottish Labour said ministers should now consider sending in the army to keep ambulance services running if the strike goes ahead.

The party’s health spokesperson, Jackie Baillie said: “No one wants these strikes, but I understand that workers have been left with no other option.

“The problems that have been building for years are now at crisis point, but Humza Yousaf is just not listening.

“It’s not too late for the SNP [Scottish National Party] to prevent these strikes by getting round the negotiating table and delivering a fair pay deal.

“We need to start contingency planning now to avoid disaster, and the SNP must consider calling in the army – but that is no substitute for trained paramedics, who need to be properly valued and fairly paid.”

Sandesh Gulhane, a physician and member of the Scottish Conservatives, said it was “disgraceful” that things have been allowed to get to this point.

He said: “The health secretary has already shamefully lost the trust of our nurses, now ambulance workers feel they have no choice but to strike too.

“Our hard-working NHS [National Health Service] staff have been pushed to the brink by years of SNP mismanagement, which has led to some of the worst working conditions in living memory.

“The SNP government must now urgently work to avert these dangerous strikes and set out contingency plans in order to protect lives, if they fail to do so.

“Sadly, the health secretary has proved himself completely unfit to deal with these grave challenges. It’s time Nicola Sturgeon stepped in, sacked Humza Yousaf and gave our heroic ambulance staff the support they need.”

He was unresponsive and they did CPR as they drove the boat back to the shore which took about 15 minutes. EMS was there and can continued and got a pulse back after about 5 minutes.  He was in our ICU for weeks.  Bad ARDS, sepsis, MSOF (or whatever the name now is). He coded every time you touched him. His SaO2 and BP were both under 80 for days.  He was up at least 50 lbs, on multiple pressors, proned, on a vec drip, etc.  No one expected a good outcome. Eventually his lungs got better, and we weaned off the sedation.

955,Chief Complaint: Exposure to Toxic Mold,yvh38w,"Let's say you have a patient coming in to your clinic with that chief complaint.

Obviously if the patient is symptomatic, I would work up their symptoms.

But if the patient is asymptomatic, how would you approach the situation?

&#x200B;

EDIT: They had symptoms. She requested blood tests that I thought were inappropriate, so I told them we'd just start with a CBC and IgE, and I referred them to an allergist. Also wrote a letter saying their symptoms are due to environmental exposure at home, so maybe they can be accommodated. I guess I've just been jaded by so many asymptomatic chief complaints, I was expecting the worst, but this was mildly interesting.

EDIT 2: So this turned out to be quite a bit more complicated than originally thought due to the lack of good scientific evidence on mold exposure.

On the one hand you have anecdotal stories from people like /u/Irishhobbit6 where the story fits a correlation - patient is at home and has symptoms, and symptoms resolve when they leave home; must be environmental exposure to mold, right!?

On the other hand you have the [position statement](https://www.acmt.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PS_060101_Institute-of-Medicine-Report-on-Damp-Indoor-Spaces-and-Health.pdf) posted by /u/wandering_meatloaf where the American College of Medical Toxicology says that while damp indoor spaces pose a health risk to humans through allergic mechanisms, it's highly unlikely that this is due to mold exposure.

But then if you dig deeper, you learn that there are phenomena like [sick building syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_building_syndrome) that are associated with a [Stachybotrys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stachybotrys_chartarum) that is also known as ""toxic black mold.""

But if you keep digging, you'll see that the [CDC's position](https://www.cdc.gov/mold/faqs.htm) is that Stachybotrys and other molds have not been shown to be linked with neurological issues like lethargy and memory loss.

So I think doing something like basic blood tests to help alleviate the patient's anxiety and then trying to have them sleep somewhere away from the exposure may be the reasonable course of action. I'm open to other suggestions though.",BallerGuitarer,41,71,0.97

Most patients who actually require our medical care are able to do few or none of these. During a standard ward round there are also too many patients for me to actually undress each one properly to examine them and I end up listening through the front and sides of the shirt and then looking at the X-ray instead to decide what I think. 

Without an assistant (nurses are always too busy) how do I optimise the physical examination of these patients and perform them with some finesse? When I am in a hurry I have literally heaved these patients up myself just so I can listen to the back but I feel horrible for doing that and I’m pretty sure if any examiner saw me do that I would fail. Still, these patients could still be sent for exams.

I realise this may be more an academic exercise than anything because practically I’ve survived by just looking at the CXR for anything but a wheeze but if anyone has any tips I would like to learn how to examine patients properly, and not just the ones that come in the textbook who can sit up for you themselves and cross their arms across their chest",PartTimeBomoh,7,8,0.75

Medical graduates are typically 24 years old.

The doctors going into private and public healthcare sectors are divided pretty evenly, almost 50% each. 

The [government website](https://csradar.com/grade/HA/Medical-And-Health-Officer) details the MONTHLY salaries for public sector doctors:

• Resident ($65,875 - $124,835 HKD), which is about $8,396 - $15,911 USD

• Associate Consultant ($120,520 - $138,855 HKD), which is about $15,361 - $17,698 USD

• Consultant ($154,700 - $249,900 HKD), which is about $19,717 - $31,852 USD

The salaries for the doctors working in the private sector is pretty hard to find, but it is apparently widely known that it can easily be 2-3x the public sector, and there's no cap on how much a doctor can be paid.

The bed becomes available, fantastic, we’re all good.…then I find out his insurance wouldn’t even cover the transportation there. So we had to wait *another* day for a charity ambulance ride to the facility.

Had another patient last week with MRSA bacteremia that needed daptomycun and ceftaroline for the next 6 weeks. None of the SNFs would take her because the antibiotics are too expensive for them to carry. We shoot for LTACH, which gets denied of course (Anthem this time) but I get this one, she really doesn’t need an LTACH, just a place that she can rehab at that’ll give her the shit she needs. I do the peer-to-peer, explain the situation. Doc says “Oh! Well let me see if we can pay for those so she can go to the SNF.” Call ends and I mutter “bull-fucking-shit you will,” to my phone afterward. I was right, we get nothing. I finished my 7th day on with this lady still waiting for a bed somewhere. 

I provided zero actual medical care to these two over my 7 day stretch. They got to sit in the hospital spending >$10k per day of their insurance company’s money only for them to not let them leave.

He finally got off of them and was sober for maybe a year or so. Then, turned to alcohol. I wish he had never gotten off the opioids because his alcoholism is horrible. It’s opened my eyes to how destructive alcohol can be. It makes me question the push to restrict opioids while there are virtually no restrictions in place for extremely harmful substances like alcohol. I guess I almost wish there wasn’t the push to nearly eradicate opioid use, but I also recognize I don’t really have a clear head about all of this.

******

First time for me-- a young teen patient threatened to kill everyone at school. Not giving any other details for privacy purposes, but just wondering about resources. School is requiring a psychiatrist clearance before pt can return, so I'm not the one who would be making the determination. There is an extended wait for child psychiatry here-- 6 months or more, so the only way to speed that up is if pt met admission criteria. 

I have no way to be part of that process either-- I would think homicidal ideation would be a shoe-in for admission and that it would be harder for the psych screener at ER to turn down (only route to psych admission in peds is through ER unless you already have a psychiatrist). Psych screeners here are RNs. Pcp gets no say.

But what I'm wondering is -- would the school be responsible for arranging the evaluation if pt has a dx already on 504 plan that's relevant? Since it's definitely affecting  his education? I don't want to suggest that to parents if not a thing under IDEA.

Resources any of you use regarding assessment for violent threats by kids? Obviously consider depression but any specific predictive tool? How would psych know whether to clear him?",OkBroccoli7880,91,165,0.96
18,"ELI5. I think I've figured out what a junior vs senior doctor is? But then what about Registrars? and Trust Grades and Clinical fellows, and specialty doctors, and associate specialists?",1185t4f,"I'm still wrapping my head on the road to a full attending in the UK.

As a frame of reference, a US medical graduate is nearly guaranteed to get SOME kind of residency that will culminate into an attending.  Not every one will be able to get an orthopedic surgery residency in San Diego, but even the last place US medical grad can find a FP or Psych in somewhere rural and expect to be a full attending at the end of the residency.

The biggest bottleneck on the road to being a ""doctor"" is med school.  57% the applicants don't get in.  After that there are more residency spots than US medical graduates

After med school, your post-graduate years up until completely of post-graduate training are often labeled as PGY1, PGY2 etc.  Internship, in general is usually just your first year of residency.  Internship is generally not a separate process or a separate application.  There are some exceptions such as transitional years or prelim years, but those are the exceptions.

Often (particularly with internal medicine and general surgery) one will proceed with additional training after residency this is called fellowship.  For example, after 3 years of internal medicine residency I may choose subspecialty training.  These positions may or may not be competitive.  Cardiology and GI are competitive while ID and nephrology are not.  Basically any warm body can get an ID/nephro position.  However, cards/GI are not guaranteed

What happens if you don't match into cards or GI?  You can try again the following year.  Maybe try again twice.  I've seen people match on their second or third try, but obviously your chances go down after each try.  that being said, once you're in, your set.  The fellowships have a well defined end point.  Once you're in your nearly guaranteed to become an attending.

What happens if you don't match into cards or GI ever?  Well, then you are ""just"" an IM attending.  But you're an attending.  You can be a hospitalists (~350K/year last time I checked with 7 on/7off) or run your own clinic.  Or maybe even give ID, nephro, palliative a shot etc.  But no mistake about it you can work full time with all the glory and pain of being an attending after IM residency.

----- 

In the UK, it seems like you finish your MBBS and then you have 2 foundation years, which I guess act as like a general IM residency or general surgery residency.

After your foundation years, then who knows?  It seems like you enter this quagmire where you hope you get some sort of training program or you just bide your time with random positions.",therationaltroll,19,16,0.86

20,Adrenal crisis / chronic steroids,11824lm,"Hospitalist here: my understanding is that for those who have been on chronic steroids that need to be weaned off, the steroids need to be slowly tapered even in those on low dosages (prednisone 5 mg/day).  In the hospital setting, when does the risk of adrenal crisis become unlikely?  I.e. can someone on Prednisone 5mg daily go into adrenal crisis if steroids were withheld for 48 hours or if they didn't receive stress dose steroids (in the setting of acute stressors)?  I tried doing a lit search on this and couldn't find an answer.  A friend and coworker and I were discussing this and are curious.  TYIA

Context: our ED boarding times are long (not infrequently more than 48 hours) and with nursing staff stretched thin due to staffing shortages, we have reasonably been asked to only resume essential home meds while they're in the ED.  I try my best to be conscientious of this and avoid restarting things like vitamins, senna, statins for primary prevention, etc.  Still, I occasionally get gentle pushback asking me why a patient's low dose steroids are being resumed in the ED.

Hello everyone,

Please note, this is not a bash on medical staff, my family are doctors and I have the utmost respect and love.

I am a clinical nurse consultant. I normally work in the emergency department as a clinical nurse and have for 10 years.

I recently joined a team of nurses whom bring critical care knowledge to the ward and review and keep and eye on patients whom have risk of deteriorating.

Working within an emergency environment I see death all the time but I'm not the one making the calls with life and death. 

I am struggling months later to deal with a death of a patient. The clinical nurse consultant role is also expanded to respond to medical emergency calls secondary to deterioration. 

I had a page to a MET call for a patient who was in mild/mod respiratory distress. Two doctors were present, both looking at the computer trying to figure out this man's history. He had nasal prongs on and hypoxia. The doctors asked for a face mask oxygen and I told them to change to a non rebreather mask as hypoxia was worsening. By the time I had arrived no one had done an ECG. Whilst they gathered the ECG machine I had to get a nurse to me his history. I also asked for an acute resus plan - he was not for CPR. His condition worsened and I had PE (no risk factors) or STEMI on my list of differentials. ECG was not overtly concerning initially, during this time the doctors were trying to get in contact with their consultant.

My next plan was to call a code however he lost cardiac output and a code team (emergency department team) would be of little benefit as he was not for CPR. 

I have played the scenario around in my head for weeks. The gentleman deteriorated so quickly, thrombolysis went through my head but time was not on our side.

Due to the doctors virtually saying nothing in the MET call I feel his death burden is on me.

One thing I have learnt is that I have a new found respect for our medical profession whom have to have this weight on their shoulders day in and day out and I hope you know that you're so appreciated.",General_Task_7509,57,0,0.5

Are these guys compromised?


-———————————————-

Health Alert on mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety

The COVID-19 pandemic brought many challenges that the health and medical field have never encountered. Although the initial response was led by a sense of urgency and crisis management, the State Surgeon General believes it is critical that as public health professionals, responses are adapted to the present to chart a future guided by data.

The State Surgeon General is notifying the health care sector and public of a substantial increase in Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports from Florida after the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Overall reports submitted to VAERS, Florida 2006–2022 - v2
Overall reports submitted to VAERS, Florida 2006–2022
In Florida alone, there was a 1,700% increase in VAERS reports after the release of the COVID-19 vaccine, compared to an increase of 400% in overall vaccine administration for the same time period (Figure 1). 

The reporting of life-threatening conditions increased over 4,400%. This is a novel increase and was not seen during the 2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign. There is a need for additional unbiased research to better understand the COVID-19 vaccines' short- and long-term effects. 

The findings in Florida are consistent with various studies that continue to uncover such risks. To further evaluate this, the Surgeon General wrote a letter to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) illustrating the risk factors associated with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and emphasizing the need for additional transparency.

According to a study, Fraiman J et al, Vaccine. 2022, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events, including coagulation disorders, acute cardiac injuries, Bell’s palsy, and encephalitis. This risk was 1 in 550 individuals, which is much higher than other vaccines.

A second study, Sun CLF et al, Sci Rep. 2022, found increased acute cardiac arrests and other acute cardiac events following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.

Additionally, Dag Berild J et al, JAMA Netw Open. 2022, assessed the risk of thromboembolic and thrombocytopenic events related to COVID-19 vaccines and found preliminary evidence of increased risk of both coronary disease and cardiovascular disease.

While the CDC has identified safety signals for stroke among individuals 65 and older following the bivalent booster administration, there is a need for additional assessments and research regarding safety of all mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

To support transparency, the State of Florida reminds health care providers to accurately communicate the risks and benefits of all clinical interventions to their patients, including those associated with the COVID-19 vaccine as additional risks continue to be identified and disclosed to the public.

The State of Florida remains dedicated to protecting communities from the risks of COVID-19 and other public health concerns, specifically by promoting the importance of treatment and promoting prevention through healthy habits. We encourage our health care partners and providers to do the same.",lemonjalo,81,135,0.93

Their response was “I always write to not exceed the max dose of acetaminophen on the prescription”. I explained these were not prescriptions but OTC meds that were provided as a discharge summary. The response was “I know how to dose Tylenol”. *click* 

Now I had a 3rd patient who was picking up an NSAID.  During the consultation the patient stated “I’m not supposed to take ibuprofen can but is this medication okay?”  After further discussion it was determined that her primary physician had diagnosed them with epigastric pain likely due to an ulcer and was told never to use any more NSAIDs.  I asked the patient if the ulcer was mentioned this to the physician they saw today and they said yes.  The patient stated the new physician acted surprised “you have an ulcer?”  Still the NSAID was prescribed. 

The patient’s primary physician and the new one are part of the same health system so notes are accessible. I’m not one to “write the board” or try to get someone in trouble but I do feel like these are basic competencies and can/will lead to patient harm.

He left to Australia to obtain his medical degree, and *~~allegedly~~* *(see below)* graduated, only to decide medicine was not for him and therefore ran off to Osaka, Japan. He now makes a living from [$374/hour tutoring services](https://mehlmanmedical.com/product/premium-tutoring-packages/) and [$260/hour ""dating"" coaching](https://mikemehlman.net/skype/).

As some of you may already be aware, and I'm sure many of you not, Michael Mehlman advertises his [services](https://mehlmanmedical.com/) as a premium 1-on-1 Tutoring for USMLE, CBSE/COMP, Shelf Exams, Clinical Rotations, Medical Coursework. Within the last 6-12 months, there has been a substantial increase in interest for his free PDFs, paid tutoring, paid Anki decks, and videos. **He also boasts a team of 21 physicians and medical students who he claims are involved in tutoring services.** Michael is known to be active on Reddit, promoting his services as well as *allegedly* harassing anyone who brings attention to what I am now.

Michael [claims](https://www.studentdoctor.net/author/michael-mehlman/) (in multiple [places](https://mehlmanmedical.com/our-team/)) to have graduated from University of Queensland in the MD-MPhil program in [May 2016](https://mikemehlman.net/2018/10/29/how-to-be-more-happy/), however, a brief search of [UQ SOM clinician scientist student page](https://medical-school.uq.edu.au/clinician-scientist-track-md-phd-and-md-mphil) (MD/PhD and MD/MPhil) does not include Michael. This page includes all students and graduates dating back to 2012. [The UQSOM c/o 2016 also graduated in December, not may.](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1291192920955384&type=3) But again, probably a rational explanation for all this.

He also lists his credentials as [MD-MPhil](https://mehlmanmedical.com/our-team/) (*masters* of philosophy) but his credentials as a First Aid author in 2015 lists him as an [MD-PhD candidate](https://mehlmanmedical.com/usmle-credentials/). In addition, it states that he was in his **sixth** and final year of his program and yet (*at the time of his enrollment)* the MPhil route did not offer a six year option, only [four or five](https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-018-1337-5). The PhD route offered a six year option, but per Michael's website, [he did not pursue and obtain a PhD](https://mehlmanmedical.com/our-team/). Again, no accusations here, just observations.

**Edit: a user has pointed out that you can** [**search**](https://academic-records.uq.edu.au/search) **for qualifications of previous UQ students. Michael does appear to have been awarded a Master of Philosophy in 06/2015 and a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 07/2016.**

None the less, that is the least of my concerns. As I was googling, trying to find his educational website, I stumbled upon (and by that I mean it is *literally* the [first result](https://www.google.com/search?q=michael+mehlman&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS942US942&oq=michael+mehlman&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l4j0i512j69i60l3.2566j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) when you search his name) his [alternative website](https://mikemehlman.net/) **with his educational website very clearly linked in the main menu.**

**I've seen many recent posts and comments about female students utilizing his tutoring services only to be seduced, invited to Japan to live with him, and subjected to creepy, predatory, misogynistic comments**. Upon further investigation and talking to women from these posts and privately, this his happened more than acceptable (with acceptable being *obviously* for this to never happen). For privacy sake, I am not going to link their posts or profiles but I will share proof via DM if anyone is wanting.

Of course, everyone is entitled to their own personal interests/habits/activities, and one's character as an educator and medical professional should *generally* not be judged upon those personal attributes. However, I think it is absolutely deplorable that he openly promotes this ideology while simultaneously promoting his medical resources and services.

Here are some examples of his sexual/dating advice from various blog posts:

""...***I will now take my clothes off despite her being unwilling to take hers off***. I will stand up, take my shirt off, and then start taking my pants off.""

*""****If she \*still\* refuses****, but is clearly willing to touch you, you can stand and* ***put it in her face***, and she’ll take it, OR if she rejects putting it in her mouth after you’ve put it in her face, ***you can usually get an HJ out of it.""***

*""****She then says, “Haha no.”*** *And you say, “That’s all we have to do. We don’t have to have sex. I don’t want to have sex.* ***Just let’s get your clothes off and we can touch****, that’s it.""*

*""After I’m in my underwear,* ***I will just pull it out***\*, even if I’m not hard, and ***put it in her face*** *as she’s sitting off the side of my bed.""*

*""My point is that you should be trying* ***repeatedly to fight through her resistance*** *in an effort to get her home...pushing anywhere between 10-20x over several minute.""*

*""So you literally have* ***zero to lose by being an unrelenting asshole*** *who pushes 20x.""*

""***Regardless of the degree of resistance she puts up*** *when I attempt to bring her hands toward my chest, the next thing I do is roll up my shirt just above the level of my nipples and* ***then take her hands again and put them on my chest***.""

***""When she’s not allowing you to take her clothes off***, what you do is essentially enter repeated cycles of engagement-disengagement-engagement-disengagement...***Then you again attempt to take her shirt off***. She again ***resists***. You then once again disengage.""

*""If* ***she refuses to get on her knees***, you just repeatedly tell her along the lines of: That’s all we have to do. Then we can stop.""

*""I often* ***push the girl down*** *on her knees at this stage (Tier 2-style).* ***If she refuses***, ***I*** ***tell her to bend over the side of my bed*** *(Tier 3-style).""*

can't forget his take on sexual health and STIs: ""***whereas some dirty slut*** *who’s been with 300+ guys might not carry anything.""*

[not to mention posting shirtless photos on his official, professional medical FB page.](https://www.facebook.com/mehlmanmedical/posts/612330570904896)

here are some [screenshots](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IsLoPl7lY5DMuL3MOxVgUrIi8Ek-uZcg/view?usp=sharing) of a video michael shared (a now deleted video, as of Feb 15, however, not before I was able to make a copy), titled *""what I immediately do after getting her clothes off""* where he explains **a woman could be ""resisting"" or ""squirming"" and you ""gotta do what you gotta do \[to penetrate\]"" or you could just ""push her down"" and ""whip it out and put it in her face.""**

gotta also appreciate his empathy: [""I once pulled a girl home from a date who then started crying in my room about a guy who broke up with her two weeks ago and how she didn’t know how to move on. Despite being emotionally vulnerable and effusive, ***where taking a good cock would be the perfect solution for her for decades to come,*** she wouldn’t hook up despite my best calibrations. The female “logic” here makes seemingly no sense, but I’ve encountered scenarios such as these a few times over the years.""](https://mikemehlman.net/2022/03/31/female-lack-of-logic-when-rejecting-men-on-cold-approach-dates/)

anyway. just like my post on [r/step1](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/) and r/medicalschool I'm sure there will be a fair share of people who couldn't care less, and that's fine, to each their own. I'm simply allowing people to make **educated** decisions about what resources they utilize and from whom, as well as what services they participate in as a professional medical educator and who they link their professional image with.

as one user commented, here's a [2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvT68l2wdM0) that perfectly encompasses what is happening in this situation.

51,"PCPs, do you plan to start prescribing Suboxone? Why or why not? [USA]",111bqdt,"As mentioned by a couple other posts on this sub, the X-waiver requirement was eliminated last month, and now any provider allowed to prescribe schedule III substances (e.g., Tylenol #3) can now prescribe buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) for treatment of opioid use disorder without any special training, authorization, or patient limits. My question to PCPs is, if you aren't already, will you start offering medical treatment for OUD? Two hypothetical scenarios to consider:

1) A new patient establishing care mentions that they were recently discharged from the local hospital on Suboxone, and since then they've done well and haven't needed heroin. They ask if you're willing to refill it, and are more than happy to submit to a drug test to prove they've been ""clean.""

2) An established patient has been stable on Suboxone for years, prescribed by a substance use clinic that doesn't accept their insurance and still requires them to come in monthly, sometimes waiting for hours to be seen. They're starting a new job and ask if you can take over, which would save them a lot of time and money.

Disclaimer: I have a strong bias regarding this subject but my intention is not to push my agenda. Rather I would like to survey the opinions out there, learn about any ""invisible"" barriers I'm not aware of, and maybe gently address some misconceptions about OUD and buprenorphine.",HarbingerKing,109,276,0.98

56,A follow-up,110vqbo,"This is a follow-up of my previous post regarding my life as a resident at my University Hospital. for context: [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/zmrn2q/judging\_people\_can\_be\_an\_inevitability/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/zmrn2q/judging_people_can_be_an_inevitability/)  


So, after around 4 months of my residency, I decided to quit. I contacted my seniors and informed them of my decision to leave my current work and travel to work for the NHS. To be fair, almost all of them talked kindly to me and even encouraged me to do my best. I started applying for jobs at a somehow increasing rate and took the path seriously. I even booked my first MRCS in May in the UK as a statement of confidence to myself and my family.   


The first few days of my quitting were marvelous to say the least. I slept full 7 hours and was able to exercise and eat healthy home-made food. I even started fixing things around the house which needed my care -my family depends on me for such things-. I went out with my friends and even made some new ones. I want to clarify that I am not unemployed and currently work at a private hospital for individual shifts and instruct courses for the European Resuscitation Council.   


On the second week, I started feeling strange: First, there was a call from an assistant professor at my hospital who knew of my plans and asked to contact me. He called basically to tell me that I was a fool for leaving and that in no way I am going to receive the same training in managing face and hand trauma as I do in Egypt, and that my job in the UK would be basically clerking patients. He worked for 6 months in the UK. I thanked him for his advice, then ignored the call and his advice.   


As of the time of writing this post, I am still unable to land a job. I understand that it takes time, but it adds to the frustration. Furthermore, I am still a member of the Whatsapp group of my department and photos of new cases keep appearing in my gallery -I did not finish my resignation papers yet as they take a lot of time-, and I can't keep myself from thinking about how I was making a change in that place, and learning. I remembered when I was super proud to pull out a nail from a patient's palm which was completely embedded and pinching the deep palmar arch to the capitate bone. I also remembered when I was able to reduce and internally fix an ulnar fracture successfully on my first time or when I sutured the buccal branch of the facial nerve around a repaired Stensen's duct...etc.   


I learned a long time ago not to regret my decisions, and that the man who made such a decision was no different than the one reconsidering today, the only difference is that the first one actually was in the scene and had a more rational, though sleep-deprived, mind. How do you deal with such feelings in your daily professional life?",Shady31413,4,43,0.94
57,Chronic Benzodiazepines,110tppf,"Hello all, 

My consult question is regarding handling long term benzodiazepine patients, specifically when it is safe to not prescribe. 

I am a relatively new attending in a rural practice that has up until me joining last August been without a permanent MD. There has been a cycle of locum MD/DO/PA/NP providers for many years, and it seems for better or worse, a number of patients have been started or continued on chronic benzodiazepines. One example is a patient with bipolar disorder who has been treated with clonazepam 1mg QID and nothing else. Geriatric patients on tenazepam for sleep, and several patients on benzodiazepines for sleep/anxiety AND opiates for chronic pain (without snri, tca or gabapentinoid). 

These are not situations I am comfortable with really but I’m stuck on this contract to stay in the USA with my family. My attendings back in residency almost never co-signed long term opiates or benzos outside of palliative patients, which is my preference honestly. 

Once a patient has been on chronic benzos for years and years, how can I avoid prescribing? I offer tapers, but if the patient refuses what to do? Literally hours from the next primary, so there is nowhere else to go. Any thoughts?",bored-canadian,172,175,0.98
58,Is it unethical to cherry pick your patient panel?,110ljpi,"I’m in an interesting situation: I have a busy outpatient IM panel at over 140% of median so I’ve opted to close my practice to new patients (especially since that number isn’t including any new patients already scheduled the rest of the year). However in an area not far from mine the only internist there has retired and their large 2k+ panel appears to be looking to me to take them on so I’m getting frequent requests asking to be scheduled. In receiving these I can’t help but chart review the patient and, this hasn’t happened yet, but if I see a patient that appears complicated my instinct would be to refuse to take them on as I already have many complicated patients in my own panel. Would this approach be unethical? Accept only the lowest complexity patients? I appreciate your feedback as I’m torn how to handle this.

The most recent standardized patient experience was on delivering bad news (cancer diagnosis) to the standardized patient. I got video review feedback from a peer, and she told me that I apologize way too much. That I should apologize just once, because multiple apologies can sound like fluff, and make the patient wonder why I'm apologizing so much when it's not my fault. 

My initial reaction to this feedback was a bit defensive. My wife has severe crippling depression, and the way that I comfort her whenever she is going through something is by apologizing... ""I'm sorry you're going through this,"" ""I'm sorry if I hurt you, that was not my intention""... etc. 

Before I met my wife I didn't really apologize unless I truly felt like I was in the wrong. But one day she broke down and said ""Why don't you say sorry back? Why am I always the one saying sorry? Why am I always the one messing up?""

And that's when I started apologizing more frequently. Not just when I was at fault, but because I do not want her to hurt, and it pains me that she is in pain. 

That is how I learned to apologize / comfort , and I approached delivering bad news to the standardized patient in that same manner, resulting in the feedback by my peer that I needed to stop apologizing so much. 

Sorry for the long context!

How the heck do I apologize / comfort a patient when delivering bad news?

So our specialist service access is often weeks (if patient is lucky) to months (usually) away if for instance I feel an epidural nerve root injection or facet joint injection is warranted given failure of the usual management ie nsaids, regular paracetamol, physio, ice/heat, keep moving, adjust work expectations, very limited use of opiates and  usually at most just codeine or tramadol (we are pretty strict with opiates here, plus they dont work in neuropathic pain), gabapentin/notryp/pregbalin etcetera.
What do you all feel about limited use of oral steroids, short course, if patient is in genuine agony. Very rarely of course, it would be in desperation. And careful consideration of side effects.

I am a new attending in primary care, taking care of an underserved population in a residency clinic. Was hoping to get feedback on my current strategy for minimizing prior auths, denials of prior auths, etc, and also trying to help the residents navigate this mess.

\- When wanting to start an expensive meds (e.g., GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2i, insulin, etc). I have been googling ""X insurance company preferred med list"" and usually can find a PDF of meds listed as preferred, PA required, non-preferred, etc. Was thinking of printing these out once a year and keeping in a binder (so anyone in our clinic can use) or saving in a folder for my computer so I don't have to search everytime.

\- If a med is listed as ""prior auth needed"" then either prescribe it with plans to do a prior auth and forewarn the patient there will be a delay OR try to anticipate which med the insurance company wants me to try first and just do that one first. First example coming to mind is that I'm assuming I'm going to have to at least try oxybutynin and maybe another med before a Myrbetriq PA would get approved so might as well start with oxybutynin. Will need to try at least a couple of first line migraine meds before something like Nurtec. If they've already tried those things but their insurance is unaware then I guess I should prescribe what I think they need and then explain their past med trials in the PA.

\- Before I (recently) started doing the above, my strategy for patients who have enough health literacy is to ask them to call their insurance company and ask which med is covered within X class of medications. For example, which (if any) GLP-1 agonist is covered for obesity, and give them a list of choices to ask about. But then they can't really walk out with a script which means more follow-up work for us when they get back to us (if they ever do). OR I'd just pick a random one and tell them to let me know if it wasn't covered and we'd try a different one. This just felt too much like guesswork and inefficient.

\- My EMR is Epic. I've noticed a column within med ordering that says things like preferred, formulary, etc., but not sure how much stock to put in that and if it's referring to formulary for my health care system's pharmacy or for the patient's insurance.

\-When I worked inpatient, we routinely sent ""test scripts"" to our institutions pharmacy and they'd run it through their insurance with a cost of a 30$ supply. Haven't tried anything similar as outpatient.

We might be getting close.....,10y7ayj,"So I had a patient with persistent symptoms from *Blastocystis*  and the PBM rejected my prior auth request for Alinia (nitazoxinde).   I hate writing these letters and though I would ask Chat GPT to help out.  One big error is that this med is not FDA approved for this indication which is a huge miss.

Dear [Insurance Company],

I am writing on behalf of my patient, [Patient's Name], to request coverage for Alinia (nitazoxanide), a medication used for the treatment of Blastocystis hominis infection. My patient has been diagnosed with this condition and requires the use of this medication for effective treatment.

Blastocystis hominis is a parasite that can cause digestive symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloating. Despite my patient's efforts to manage these symptoms through lifestyle changes and other medications, they persist and significantly impact their quality of life. I have determined that Alinia is the best course of treatment for my patient's condition, as it has been shown to effectively eliminate the parasite and alleviate symptoms.

I have already tried other treatments for this condition, including [list other treatments], but they have not been effective in controlling my patient's symptoms. Alinia is a safe and effective medication that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Blastocystis hominis infection.

I understand that Alinia is not covered under my patient's current insurance policy and I am requesting that it be added as a covered benefit. I have enclosed all necessary documentation, including a letter detailing my patient's medical history and the necessity of this treatment.

I appreciate your time and attention in reviewing this request. I look forward to hearing from you regarding the status of this claim. If you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

I'm unsure how to find this info - I tried checking UpToDate and searching pubmed, but significant search term crossover and just not knowing that much derm, I'm a little lost.

Toenails can grow in congenitally split. What I found was this is believed to be some ""incomplete form of polydactyly""

&#x200B;

1. If an apparently split toe nail always grows back split, is that enough to identify an accessory toenail, or are there some degrees of trauma to the nailbed that could result in permanent, but not congenital, splitting?
2. Is there an association between congenital accessory nails and more advanced, true bony, degrees of polydactyly? Like does it indicate a higher likelihood of children with polydactyly?

Anyway, I've been working as a medical administrative assistant for years and we recently hired a new MD. Apparently this MD has a policy where she requires her patients to have an appointment every single month if they take schedule IV controlled substances. She insists this is what the DEA requires. I have never heard of this in my life and patients are getting extremely mad because they're used to only coming in every 3 to 6 months. And honestly I cannot blame them because not only is it kind of annoying, but it's a financial hit having to pay a copay monthly or if you're out of pocket it gets very expensive. Especially considering a lot of these patients are students who probably don't have much income and just need their ADHD medicine so they can do their work. I've tried to look up the requirements, but honestly I haven't found any evidence to support the MD's claim. Although, our office is in Georgia and I did find a page stating the rules and regulations for prescribing controlled substances in Georgia and it says this, ""No prescription drug order for a C-III, IV, or V controlled substance shall be filled or refilled more than six (6) months after the date on which such prescription drug order was issued by the prescribing practitioner and no such prescription drug order may be authorized to be refilled for the quantity prescribed more than five (5) times."" Now please correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't that mean patients have to at least have an appointment every 6 months to receive a prescription for controlled substances?

If all of the legislation passed to control  the practice of healthcare were called “unfunded mandates” on healthcare providers maybe the money worshipers would see that this comes out of their pockets now as they increasingly own all of healthcare. Regardless, I think that releasing clinically accurate psychiatric notes that are used to document care for my reference and for the next provider and to defend me in any “medico-legal” difficulties.

Regardless, I am not putting access to patients psychiatric records on my EHR. This is my hill to die on. Harming patients to follow a law? Won’t do it. I do not care who made the law. You might think that as a lowly NP I would grovel to follow the rules and attract no negative attention. But a key part of nursing that is drilled into us is that we are the last line of “defense” between the patient and the world check the med order to see if that med makes sense for this condition, don’t let random orderlies take them away for a random procedure, looking for lab results we know were ordered (not by us on the floor) and making sure they come back and what range they are in and to acting on the information.

(I’m not implying that physicians are not completely dedicated to patient care, I’m just explaining the pit bull attitude in nurses that we have all seen and I am exhibiting.

Therefore, I am not releasing these records to my patients. It will destroy all trust with my psychotherapy and other patients. If the goal is for me to soft pedal my notes, I won’t. I go out of my way not to use pejorative language in my notes, however, psychiatric terms can sound pejorative to the layman. I’m not going to release my notes for my patient’s sakes. I am the one taking care of these patients. I have to take responsibility for the negative outcomes during their care. We work in a system marked by only negative reinforcements from government agencies and, at present, little respect from many patients. The money payers offer only goes so far to compensate for the sht eating. Also I am not going to spend all my time outside of sessions explaining to patients what their notes mean. No patients have asked so far. The government really really wants us to work for big corporate healthcare systems. I won’t.

Most onerously, I have been on service during working hours M-F *every week for months*.  When this was first proposed, it was ""until I had privileges"" (at this time, I was partnering with another attending).  After I got privileges, I immediately started taking service on my own, and it was ""until the end of the month"".  Then it was until I got ""busier"" (noticing a pattern at this point, I attempted to get a more specific threshold, which he refused to give).

I have several other concerns with his management, most of which can be summed up as micromanagement, but to be blunt I think the list of complaints is probably substantial and unique enough that it could be enough to identify me (this post started out a lot longer).  This is the most problematic one for me though.

SO, my questions:

1. How common is it to have new attendings staff service every week, during normal working hours but not evenings or weekends (except for an equitable share of call)?
2. When it is done, how long does the new attending usually cover service in this way for?  Is ""months"" a typical duration?  Is it more of a productivity threshold, and if so is that threshold the long-term target or some lesser amount?
3. If I object to this, but my chief refuses to budge and other division members stay out of it, do I have any options besides sucking it up for however long or quitting (which I really don't want to)?

Edit: To clarify, I also currently have 4 half-day clinics, with the expectation when I signed that I will need 5 to meet my eventual RVU requirements.

As I have been practicing for the past 2 years, it has come to my attention that the healthcare insurance companies in this country have become too powerful. They need to be placed on a checks and balances system of some kind, or the health insurance system needs a massive overhaul.

Insurance companies are year after year placing more pressure on physicians and other providers to do more nit picky things so that they can decline to provide payment for services rendered if nit picky thing was not done. These things have added up and they continue to add more administrative burden on us all. I am getting sick of it. We need to do something about this instead of continuing to take whatever they throw at us Year after year.

Whatever is currently being done to fight this obviously is not working. We need to do more. This is affecting all physicians and providers across the board. Should we go on strike?

The way I understand it:

Sensitivity is used to rule OUT a disease. Sensitivity is best at correctly identifying the people WITH the disease.

Specificity is used to rule IN a disease. It is best at correctly identifying those WITHOUT the disease.

What is the actual difference between them? Imagine 100% sensitivity and specificity. The way I see it, sensitivity says, ""You have this disease because you tested positive"" or ""You do not have this disease because you did not test positive."" Then, specificity says, ""You do not have this disease because you tested negative,"" or ""You do have this disease because you did not test negative."" Is this line of thinking correct?

If yes, then aren't they both good at simply confirming or denying disease? Is it that sensitivity tells us we can cross a disease off the DD because they did not test positive, and specificity tells us we've confirmed the diagnosis if they do test positive? Is it that we use higher sensitivity tests when we're narrowing down our DD, then a higher specificity test to confirm our suspicions?

I admit I feel embarrassed asking, but I really do want to get this down so I can fully understand test results when I am practicing.

129,Overdoses involving methadone increased 48% in the US during the COVID-19 relaxation of 'take-homes' according to data from the Centers for Disease Control,10slsq1,"Here is the abstract of this newly published study in the journal *Forensic Science International*.

*Background:*

The US opioid overdose epidemic continues to escalate. The restrictions on methadone availability including take-home dosing were loosened during the COVID-19 pandemic although there have been concerns about the high street value of diverted methadone. This report examined how fatal overdoses involving methadone have changed over the past two-decades including during the pandemic.

*Methods:*

The CDC’s Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) was used to find the un-intentional methadone related overdose death rate from 1999 to 2020. Unintentional methadone deaths were defined using the ICD X40–44 codes with only data for methadone (T40.3). Data from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) on methadone overall use, opioid treatment programs use, and pain management use was gathered for all states for 2020 and corrected for population.

*Results:*

There have been dynamic changes over the past two-decades in methadone overdoses. Overdoses increased from 1999 (0.9/million) to 2007 (15.9) and declined until 2019 (6.5). Overdoses in 2020 (9.6) were 48.1% higher than in 2019 (t(50) = 3.05, p < .005). The state level correlations between overall methadone use (r(49) = +0.75, p < .001), and opioid treatment program use (r(49) = +0.77, p < .001) with overdoses were positive, strong, and statistically significant. However, methadone use for pain treatment was not associated with methadone overdoses (r(49) = −0.08).

*Conclusions:*

Overdoses involving methadone significantly increased by 48.1% in 2020 relative to 2019. Policy changes that were implemented following the COVID-19 pandemic involving methadone take-homes may warrant further study before they are made permanent.

CT has been around for 2 decades now, and several studies suggest CT has significantly lesser post-op pain and faster recovery than ET. Although few studies suggest some downsides these are not very significant or conclusive. CT downsides include small increased risk of bleeding, higher PTH, longer operative time and slightly higher cost.

I know many physicians in other parts of the world like India who swear by CT and that is all they do. But for some reason CT has been very slow to catch on in the US. The main argument I hear against CT is that evidence of CT benefits found by some studies is weak or inconclusive. Is there a stronger argument against CT/in favor of ET?

Given that CT likely has benefits over ET, it has been widely adopted in other parts of the world and doesn't have any significant downsides over ET why don't we see a higher adoption in the US?

In the last two years, I have had two acquaintances and one very close friend all suffer a stillbirth, two at 40 weeks. It is completely devastating.

Propublica, an investigative journalism nonprofit, is doing this [series](https://www.propublica.org/series/stillbirths) on stillbirths. It seems to be common to blame stillbirths in some cases on medical mismanagement, and I'm sure that is sometimes the case. I have a number of questions for the FM/OB/pathologists of reddit:

&#x200B;

1. It seems to be common that after suffering a stillbirth, women say it never even crossed their mind that it could happen and they wish their doctor had brought it up. Do you ever bring this up with patients and if so, how?
2. Do you specifically recommend ""Count the Kicks"" or just give general guidance about movement?
3. This one may be more for the pathologists, but in the large number of stillbirths that get classified as unexplained, are there any leading theories for what could be contributing? I haven't found much in all the research I've read. Is there anything else we could be doing from the physician side to prevent these losses?",ShotskiRing,89,112,0.95

159,The public needs to know that an urgent care does not equal an antibiotic dispensary.,10ojo7z,"Mainly just ranting here. My wife is currently doing clinical hours at an urgent care and the amount of people coming in simply demanding a certain antibiotic is insane. I knew this has always happened, but I didn’t realize how much it is until she started working there. Multiple people every day. 

Someone comes in complaining of a single day of sinus pressure and just demands a z-pack. “No, I know I just need a z-pack and it’ll knock it out.” My wife says no you don’t need that and 99% of the time they get extremely angry. Not just annoyed, but like yelling at her and threatening her. I don’t know how she does it I would lose my mind there.

I mean what do people think and urgent care is? You still have to be assessed by a provider, diagnosed, and they recommend a treatment plan that they and the patient think is best. But she’s not gonna just give them an antibiotic to make them happy when she thinks they don’t need it.

EDIT: I am aware that patients do this cause they’ve went to urgent cares in the past that give antibiotics out like candy. That’s why they get so angry when they go to one like the one my wife’s at, and the providers don’t give them antibiotics for a runny nose. It has to change on both sides.",cereal1010,171,426,0.96

I also explain to her that I know other healthy people who are on semaglutide who now don't have the energy or motivation to exercise or do things they enjoy anymore because they aren't getting enough calories from what they eat.

In my distracted state, I managed to drop all the miso on the surgical table.

However, many Western/Northern European countries (with amazing healthcare systems) seem to have a more conservative approach especially with children. Here are a few examples:

1. **Norway:** ""All children aged 12-15 will be offered a second dose of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, if they and their parents so wish. Those who have previously had COVID-19 are not currently being recommended for vaccination."" [Source](https://www.helsenorge.no/en/coronavirus/covid19-vaccination/#who-should-get-the-covid19-vaccine)

[Source](https://www.sst.dk/en/english/corona-eng/vaccination-against-covid-19)

169,Always on call?,10njq1a,"I'm an assistant doctor in a German hospital in my second year to become a pediatrician. At the moment I am working on the pediatric ICU. We are working in 3--shifts Monday to Thursday and in 2-shifts Friday to Sunday.

Just to fill you guys in a little: In every shift is one assistant doctor at the ICU. Monday to Friday from 8-16:30pm we also have one or two attending physicians in the ICU.  
We are pretty understaffed, for moths now - not because there is no possible employees but because the Vorstand (think of it as the Hospitals CEO) isn't willing to pay for sufficient amount of staff.

In case of a sickness of one member of staff it is common practice to call all other employees (that are not working on those days) to ask if they can help out. There is no compensation if you actually do so. Since we're heavily understaffed for about a year now, the willingness to help out is at a low point. In result the Chief physician started to order people to work even if they do not agree to help. You can refuse this order but if you do you have to face work-related legal consequences and would have to defend your case in a court. While you're likely to win (because the cases where even a Chief physician is allowed to order you to work once you have your shift-plan are very narrow) this is likely expensive and stressful, so at least at our hospital no one tried to refuse an direct order yet. I was ordered to work this way twice last year, in the last instance on December, 26th.  
As a result I decided not to pick up my phone anymore if the hospital is calling. You are not legally obligated to take any calls or messages from your employer in your off time in Germany. If the employer is not able to reach you, he can not order you to work. It's the only way to protect your free time.  
I tried to convince the other doctors to do the same. This was also the legal advice of the union's lawyer. Sadly my colleagues are very hesitant to provoke any kind of conflict. They complain about the situation a lot, but they are not likely to act to force a change. Especially non-ICU doctors with work duty while a sick note comes in are likely to be ordered to take over the shifts face to face which makes it especially hard to refuse.

So today the person that would have worked 12-hour night-shifts from Friday to Sunday called in sick. The Hospital tried to call me several times - I did not pick up. The Chief physician than sent me a Voice message via Whatsapp (It is VERY uncommon to get contacted via social media from you Employer) which I did not listen to.  
I don't know what happened after this. Someone will probably work those shifts. I am very sure that hell will break over me next week. The usual approach of the employer is a reversal of guilt, blaming me that others had to work in my place, telling me all the trouble is my fault while completely ignoring the fact that the employer is obligated to prepare for a typical amount of sick notes bei either installing on-call duties or a reserve pool (needs more staff) or paying for on-demand honorary staff (even more expensive that more staff). It's also possible that I will be threatened with legal actions.

I am sure that I am doing the right thing - legally and also to change the unbelievable toxic working environment in my hospital. But damn, I'm nervous as fuck.

177,What’s up with all these clinics offering “compounded semaglutide”?,10msn4i,"Several weight loss clinics in my area are prescribing “generic” semaglutide to patients, seemingly to anyone who walks in the door. The medicine is being made in a compounding pharmacy.  Can someone explain to me how this is happening when it’s a patented medicine? Is it real semaglutide that they are somehow obtaining on the black market? Is it completely fake? 

I’m not referring patients myself to these clinics, of course, but I’ve seen several people now who are taking these injections and quite a few who are asking about it because their friends are going there. The patients do seem to be losing weight on it.  I’m really just wondering how concerned I should be. If it’s real medicine that’s questionably legal, that’s one thing, but if they are getting something completely different then I feel like I need to take a more active role in convincing people to stop taking it.

Until otherwise knowing how receptive the patient is, one should generally not swear around their patients. E.g. probably not around your 80 year old ladies in their Sunday best. However I feel like it can be helpful in establishing rapport with some patients as well. If someone has a slip of tongue and then try and correct themselves I'll say something along the lines of, 'don't apologize for saying shit you would say at home'. Situations like when the patient is cussing frequently or using it with someone in a circumstance where it can lighten up the mood if you've heard them swear before seems helpful too. For instance to change the topic when a patient is talking about politics ""Ah politicians, fucking crooks all of them - right and left"". Another one I'll use is when I'm underscoring the importance of a test for some of my patients, particularly semi to frequently non-compliant ones, is ""I don't want you to take the FAFO route on getting this [stress test/whatever], this is important. If you don't hear from scheduling soon let me/staff know"" 

As I have been in practice as an attending for longer and longer I have certainly been more lax as I get to know my patients and their families, but unlike some fields, I have the benefit of continuity as well.

185,Why don't we learn about emotional support animals on our psych rotations?,10m2lv9,"I just saw a patient with PMHx of anxiety who requested I write a letter for her stating that her dog can be used as an emotional support animal, specifically because she's moving to a dwelling that doesn't normally allow animals but would honor a doctor's note.

I wrote the note, solely based on the thought ""Hey, if this dog is part of the patient's family and helps her control her anxiety in such a we that we can keep her medication dosing low, then sure, I'll do what I can to help out.""

Absolutely not evidenced-based. No science behind it. When I Google ""NEJM emotional support animal"" or ""JAMA emotional support animal"" nothing comes up.

When I just google ""Emotional support animal"" a web site comes up called [usserviceanimals.org](https://usserviceanimals.org) that says it acts as a registry for service animals, but then when I further investigate it, there is no official registry for service animals.

But that's misleading, because *service dogs* are a real officially recognized thing.

I’m completing my nursing bachelor’s degree at a well respected state university in the US, and the curriculum is rife with this kind of anti-physician/pro-nursing nonsense. I cannot understand what the purpose of this slide is, other than to indoctrinate younger nurses into thinking that physicians are heartless automatons who do nothing but treat symptoms and care nothing for their patients, but nurses are at the pinnacle of the “holistic” treatment of humans.  

The misrepresentation is so disgusting to me.  Imagine using the word “reductionist” to describe the entire medical profession.  Imagine actually thinking that physicians know only “basic science”.  The overinflated sense of self-importance on the nursing side of the chart is also gross, but less so to me than the other side.

188,Circumcision,10lsoru,"Reddit seems to have a particular fascination with circumcision. It seems like every other week I’m reading a post in AskReddit or somewhere else about people’s feelings towards it.

I was taught in medical school that circumcision decreases transmission of HIV and HPV along with decreasing incidence of infant UTI’s and incidence penile cancer.

Occurrence of male UTI is relatively low, so clinical benefit is marginal at best unless high risk with urological conditions. Penile cancer is also relatively rare, so clinical benefit seems marginal.

Decreasing transmission of HIV seems like a legitimate reason for me and it seems like many studies have shown there are a significant number of HIV receptors on the inside of the foreskin. CDC states circumcision can decrease a man’s risk by 50-60%. 

Decreasing HPV transmission is also huge, especially for women as this is the major cause of cervical cancer. HPV vaccination is still low for men compared to women, but that seems to be changing via 2020 vaccine survey data with rates for girls being 77% and boys being 74%.

Just for full disclosure, I am circumcised and also vaccinated against HPV. I understand this is a very personal and inflammatory topic. What are your thoughts on it?

However, evidence of a causal link between the microbiota and tau-mediated neurodegeneration is lacking. In this study, we characterized a genetically engineered mouse model of tauopathy expressing human ApoE isoforms reared under germ-free conditions or after perturbation of their gut microbiota with antibiotics.

197,Gut microbes might strongly influence the body’s thermostat,10kwn7p,"What’s considered normal body temperature varies from person to person, yet overall, the average basal temperature of the human body has decreased since the 1860s for unknown reasons. A study points to the gut microbiome as a potential regulator of body temperature, both in health and during life-threatening infections.

Work published in the *American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine* in 2019 has demonstrated that hospitalized patients with sepsis vary widely in their temperature responses, and this variation predicts their survival.

Yet the causes of this temperature variation, both in sepsis and in health, have remained unknown. “We know that temperature response is important in sepsis, because it strongly predicts who lives and who dies,” said Dickson. “But we don’t know what drives this variation and whether it can modified to help patients.”

 In particular, common bacteria from the Firmicutes phylum were most strongly associated with increased fever response. These bacteria are common, variable across patients, and are known to produce important metabolites that enter the bloodstream and influence the body’s immune response and metabolism.

“We found that the same kind of gut bacteria explained temperature variation both in our human subjects and in our laboratory mice,” said Dickson. “This gave us confidence in the validity of our findings and gives us a target for understanding the biology behind this finding.”

Unfortunately, this meant that any time I was struggling with worsening symptoms, I didn’t ask for help or talk to anybody in leadership until my professional performance was affected. In residency, I had to undergo probation because of how my poor mental health was impacting me and actually also took a 1 month medical LOA.

We work as ER doctors under the supervision of EM specialists. The system here is very problematic. We are expected to keep patients happy. Patients who come into the ER cannot be denied service because their complaints are not urgent and have to be seen as soon as possible. Each physician sees over a hundred patients with very mild sicknesses (URIs, 2-day-old gastroenteritis, muscle aches, etc.).

219,A PA’s perspective,10hwv0f,"After diving down a rabbit hole on negative (some aggressively so) posts/comments regarding relationships between PAs and residents, I thought I’d share my experience over the past several years. 

A little about me. I am a former infantry combat medic now working as a Trauma and General surgery PA. I love being a PA and understand that my role on the team is not as a physician, but as an extension and extra set of hands for my surgeons. 

I know a lot of the issues with/against mid levels/APPs (or whatever) surrounds encroachment/creep. In my role, I don’t see much of it given the extremely close and seamless relationship I have with my attendings. As I said above, I am an extension of them. Can I function independently in certain aspects? Sure. Typically we make informed decisions together and as a team. I’ll bet there is more of this creep/encroachment in other types of clinical settings, especially clinic based medicine where independent practice is a hot topic. Anyway, this post is less about all that and more about my relationship with residents as a PA.

I work very closely with residents (we are a non-academic center rotation for them if that helps provide context), though we typically work different days. There is usually only 1 resident, sometimes 2 and our schedules overlap fairly consistently, usually once or twice a week. We have similar duties when we are on call. Rounds, first call, traumas, consults, procedures, first assist in the OR, floor care/critical care in the ICU, etc. 

I’ve had a fantastic relationship with all the residents I’ve worked with so far. We divide and conquer, helping each other as needed. I have the upmost respect for their educational process and actively go out of my way to ensure they get the procedures and cases they need. All I really care about is stabilizing and treating our patients to the highest standard. I don’t care who puts the cordis in. If an intern/PGY2 wants to put the cordis in, I’m making sure we have a good secondary at the same time or that products are ready to roll, and vise versa.

In the OR, if the resident is there, I will second assist or manage things on the floor/ICU/cover traumas. That is, unless my attendings prefer me to first assist for some reason. Working for that long together, we’ve become a well oiled machine and can anticipate each others next move. Sometimes our interns and new second years just aren’t there yet (I can count on one hand how many times this has happened though, as they are typically pretty fucking good). Toward Summer, our second years are very very good. When we have our PGY3+‘s are on service, it’s typically just me and the resident operating with our attending lurking in the periphery.

If things get crazy from an operative standpoint, I’ll make sure their side of the list is squared away, orders are in, families are contacted, and the notes are done so they don’t have to stay insanely late. If they do stay late, I’ll cover the hospital in the morning so they can grab an extra hour or two before coming in (they usually come in anyway though because they’re crackheads). Please let me know who I have to beat up so that you guys are paid at least as much as I am. The net hourly rate is nauseating. 

Given the nature of their training, I learn a lot from having them around. They are great with keeping me up to date on the medicinal side of critical care, something I learned very little of in PA school. What I enjoy and appreciate most is what they bring to the table from their rotations in other sub specialties that I have no exposure to. 

I’ve seen a lot of posts/comments  regarding the low intelligence level of PAs and how we don’t bring much to the table and make poor clinical decisions. While I can understand that rhetoric given some of my experiences with certain colleagues, I think its a gross generalization. I’ve seen physicians, PAs, NPs, RNs, techs, pharmacist make consistently poor decisions. It usually has more to do with them as a person and how much they are willing to apply themselves to improving their clinical knowledge, day in and day out. A lot of folks get complacent and overconfident, sometimes grossly incompetent because of poor confidence, and as a result, consult everyone under the sun, which has its own set of problems. That was a bit of a tangent, but I digress.

Becerra* (No. 20-1114, 2022 WL 2135490), CMS is finalizing a general payment rate of ASP plus 6% for drugs and biologicals acquired through the 340B Program, consistent with our policy for drugs not acquired through the 340B program. **As required by statue, CMS is implementing a –3.09% reduction to the payment rates for non-drug services to achieve budget neutrality for the 340B drug payment rate change for CY 2023.** CMS will address the remedy for 340B drug payments from 2018-2022 in future rulemaking prior to the CY 2024 OPPS/ASC proposed rule. We note that claims for 340B-acquired drugs paid after the district court’s September 28, 2022 ruling are paid at the default rate (generally ASP plus 6%).",supapoopascoopa,3,34,0.97

I'm a student technician/physiologist (the one who does the ECGs/PFTs/carotid duplex scans/EEGs ect) and I'm kind of worried about how a fellow student is talking to me about patients while we're on placement.
We don't really take any like morals or ethics lectures that talk about proper patient treatment. I guess it's kind of assumed to be common sense. We also don't really have anyone in particular I can ask for advice on this so I thought asking other healthcare workers would be the next best option. I looked through the rules and to my understanding this isn't breaking any but if I'm wrong please let me know.

So I'm on placement and a fellow student is in another department (cardiology) and occasionally we meet up for lunch. The past two times he's been saying things that are making me uncomfortable. For context he's a 30 year old man, who has experience working as a first responder prior to this.

When talking about patients he's doing ECGs on he keeps commenting on their bodies to me for example:
- He commented on how attractive one early 20s physically fit patient was.
- He makes comments about how sweaty/saggy female breasts can be saying things like needing to 'roll them up'.
- Constantly undermines pain experienced by females, particularly in regards to how painful cramps are/can be.

We have someone who organises placement and I'll be seeing them in person soon so I guess I'm wondering if this is something that I should bring up with them? I'm not sure if I'm just being over sensitive and I don't want to make myself look like I'm trying to pull down another student to get ahead but I also don't think this behaviour is appropriate. I know I would be incredibly uncomfortable if I was a patient and overheard a HCW talking like that, especially if I was a woman and had to then go in and undress before the same HCW.

Way back when I worked in retail pharmacy, I had a patient who had ""diabetes."" This patient came in complaining about the cost of their test strips and was talking about how ever since he made some lifestyle changes that his BG had been perfectly normal ever since.

I, being curious, asked what it was that had so drastically changed the state of his condition to where he was seemingly 'better.' His response was ""Well, I cut out drinking sweet tea."" I was a bit incredulous so I asked ""You cut out sweet tea, that's all you did? How much were you drinking?"" and he answers ""Well I'd have about four glasses a day. I also added four *tablespoons* of sugar to each glass."" 

For those not from the south, sweet tea usually contains 25g of sugar per glass. A tablespoon of sugar is about 12.5g. So with every one of this dude's glasses, he was getting 75g of sugar... four times a day. 300 grams of sugar a day. I didn't have those numbers readily handy at the time but I ballparked in my head. I really don't know how this dude didn't get repulsed by *that much* sugar. *No wonder* his BG kept coming back so outrageously high. (The ""bruh moment"" in question)

We just kinda stared at each other awkwardly for a moment before I said ""Yeah... yeah, that might do it."" He asked me ""So do you think I should keep testing?"" and I responded ""It's your money, but I'd definitely call your doctor and tell them what you just told me and see what they say.""

When one of you all say the phrase ""poor historian"" in a presentation, you are outing yourself as a physician or medical professional who lacks the skills to obtain a medical history from a patient who is either A) altered or B) poorly educated in their medical care.  

You are the ""historian"" taking the history from the patient.  They are the ""informant"" or ""interviewee.""  You went to medical school and (typically) the patient did not.  It is not nice to blame the patient for not knowing how to structure their responses to fit our needs.  They have no idea what is or is not important.  

It's not a semantics thing.  You will become a better historian when you stop blaming the patient for your shit interview technique.  If there is a real barrier to obtaining a medical history, note it and move on.  If they don't know their medications, for instance, you have other ways to find out rather than torturing them with a thousand questions.

The Ego in Medicine

I’m so frustrated. Without compromising patient info… a chronic pain patient being changed from oxycodone to Nucynta. The daily dose the doctor wrote for was over two times higher than their oxycodone daily dose (75 MME to 160). 

I call and speak to a nurse being concerned since usually opioids are reduced 25% when changing drugs. The nurse proceeds to tell me I’m calculating MME wrong and it is actually a dose reduction at 40 MME. I tell her to use an MME calculator to make it easier and walk her through it. She angrily stated “I’m going right from CDC you’re wrong.”  After walking her through the math SHE REALIZES SHE’S LOOKING AT TRAMADOL CONVERSION. After this she proceeds to say “well the doctor prescribed it and he knows what he is doing so he won’t be changing it.”  Further argument ensues on my part with concern for the patient’s safety. Finally she states “I’ll just have the doctor talk to you directly.”  I said please do so we can get that resolved. 

Hours pass with no call, new escribe comes over to cancel old dose and reduce to newly prescribed med.  This nurse’s ego was so great that not only could she not see her own error but she would put the physician at risk by okaying a dangerously high dose. 

Share your most infuriating ego story.

We’ve had an unusually high number of patients recently with persistent nose bleeds, and it seems like every time ENT is consulted they insist on using afrin. In the worst cases we finally had a pharmacist reach out and suggest TXA after going through half a dozen bottles of afrin with no result. 

The outpatient guidelines for afrin in nosebleeds is one dose followed by 20 minutes of direct pressure, and if bleeding persists after that to seek medical intervention with no more than 3 days total usage for sporadic bleeding. 

Obviously we aren’t going to hold you strictly to those guidelines (unless you get a real asshole of a pharmacist) since we trust you know what you’re doing, but some of these cases have left us scratching our heads.

It was eye-opening, to say the least. I was skeptical about a lot of parts first, but the more I reflect, the more I realize that our action, or inaction, is partly responsible for the messed up culture in healthcare. 

I'm not going to summarize the whole book, but a lot of it was about elitism in medicine and how our egos and self-interest prevent reform for patients and doctors. 

FYI, If you're already mad reading what I wrote, you may be part of the problem 😉. 

Jk jk but for real, I started reflecting about the posts on r/residency and r/medicine and r/noctor and personal experience, and it kinda makes sense. 

For example, we love to rave against mid-levels, providing sub-par care. The very easy solution to this is to train more doctors. But just look at the r/residency sub, and you'll find a recent post about expanding residency spots and all the comments about how this will be bad for wages. The same sub will have tons of posts about how midlevels suck and shouldn't be allowed to practice. 

But it isn't just reddit. Our professional medical organizations rarely advocate for more residency spots. The AMA only recently started doing so, after lobbying AGAINST more doctors in the 1980s. If you're actively ranting against midlevels and silent about actual solutions to address the physician shortage, it's more about self-interest than anything else. Can't have your cake and eat it too. 

A few years ago, it was all Doom and Gloom for anesthesiologists because CRNAs were increasing. If anyone hasnt noticed, our gas buddies are still making a good living. In 2008 to 2012 most doctors were against the ACA, even though we knew it was better for patients.  One bipartisan bill against surprise billing in Congress comes up, and all the medical organizations come out with coordinated messages against it.

Almost everyone physician I know has kids and I rarely meet people who don’t want kids. The only people I’ve met that say they regretted kids (which is a hard thing to admit openly) are people who’s kid is around 2 years old and throwing tantrums often.

Does anyone here have kids that kind of envy a life where they didn’t have children?

Anyone here that specifically chose not to have kids that really enjoy their lifestyle without children?

Hoping to see some discussion from anyone willing to share. I really value my freedom, independence and am passionate about travel. I am often thinking of which next trip I will take for my next time off. Anytime I have time off, I go somewhere if I have enough money saved. When I was younger I used to want a family, but for whatever reason, over residency, I fantasize more about travel than I do about a family and thought I was undecided. But recently the thought of kids has started to make me feel uneasy as if it's constricting or would tie me down. Maybe it's the years of training and sacrifice and putting all those other things on hold that makes me want to just focus on my dreams of travel and live the lifestyle that's maybe a bit more luxurious than it would be with kids. I could see how rewarding it could be to raise children and watch them grow up. There are pros and cons to both. Sometimes I see my peers or attendings with kids who seem happy with them but also seem limited in their lifestyle or ability to travel and their life really gets consumed by their children.

I appreciate any of you who chose to share and I respect anyone’s decision to have or not have children. Thank you.",msnervouspickle,510,479,0.94

274,Do Stimulant Medications Cause Endothelial Dysfunction?,10b9747,"Med student here. I got curious today about how exactly nicotine itself can cause endothelial dysfunction, which is something I've been aware of since working in a cardiology clinic for a couple of years. It seems like this is at least partially attributed to excess catecholamine-mediated vasoconstriction. For this reason, it would of course not be recommended for patients at risk of CVD to use nicotine in any form. 

This got me thinking, however, about whether or not stimulant medications could also cause endothelial dysfunction through a similar mechanism. Even ""non-stimulant"" medications like bupropion significantly increase levels of circulating catecholamines. More so with medications like Adderall. 

I am of course aware of blood pressure/HR monitoring in patients on these medications, but never hear endothelial dysfunction discussed on its own. In fact, it's quite difficult to find any research on the topic at all. Speaking from experience, however, even 150mg of bupropion can cause noticeable vasoconstriction (with normal BP/HR). 

 It seems like there's plenty of research on whether stimulant medications can increase MACE, but not a lot on whether they could be independently contributing to the development of atherosclerosis via endothelial dysfunction, even in the setting of normal BP/HR. 

Am I missing something here? Am I simply incorrect to assume that vasoconstriction from stimulant medications is not necessarily suggestive of endothelial dysfunction? Is this just a risk that physicians take when prescribing these medications? 

Lastly, why isn't there more research on whether long-term use of, for example, Adderall has the potential to drive premature atherosclerosis?",ASK_ME_IF_IM_JESUS,44,119,0.97

>Epic In Basket users will now see a new feature that will automatically “hide” responses that contain only a simple expression of gratitude such as, “Thank you.” This change was made by Epic to improve user In Basket efficiency by “hiding” messages that don’t actually need users’ attention. Based on Epic’s analysis, these messages constitute around four percent of Patient Med-Advice messages.

>When a patient replies to a Patient Med-Advice message (only) and includes ONLY the exact phrases in the table screenshot here (punctuation excluded), the message will be “hidden,” which means users will not receive a New Message (bolded) notification. 

>Example: If a Patient Med-Advice message response says ""Thank you, Dr. Ruth"", “Many thanks to you” or “Thank you. I need…” it would not be hidden because it does not exactly match one of the above phrases. In this case, users would receive a New Message. The message would only be hidden if it said only, ""Thank you"", “Thanks” or any other exact phrases listed in the table.

Thats right- instead of focusing on why it takes 300 clicks to close an encounter, they decided the true efficiency killer was providers receiving gratitude from their patients. I’d love to say I’m shocked by how tone deaf and misguided this is, but it’s par for the course unfortunately.

284,MD blacklisted at Walgreens,10a4yxb,"I am posting on behalf of my spouse who is a psychiatrist (MD) in private practice.

This week, her patients reported that Walgreens refused to fill prescriptions for controlled substances. She called, and Walgreens could not find an explanation but promised to look into it. Eventually they sent an email stating ""Walgreens will no longer dispense controlled substance prescriptions prescribed by you."" The email states to refer to a letter, which we haven't received.

After some googling, I suspect this is related to the $10 billion [settlement](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/walgreens_multistate_agreement_and_exhibits.pdf) Walgreens agreed to in December 2022 over opioids. The agreement has a section on monitoring and blocking prescribers. ""The Prescriber Review Process shall employ algorithms, or other means, to review data on Walgreens’ retail dispensing for potential Prescribers of concern.""  (see page 311 for more detail)

We are in one of the Settlement States. She does not prescribe opioids, but she prescribes controlled substances such as Adderall and benzos for psychiatric conditions.

While she is stingy with new patients and below the median for our state overall, she inherited a lot of patients (from retiring physicians at her practice) who were already on high doses. She is trying to taper them, but she can't just discontinue their meds all at once.

295,"How to have ""that conversation"" (CODE STATUS)",10889yh,"The topic of code status conversations has come up a lot recently in my professional life and after some reflection, I decided that I'd share my method for ascertaining code status with the r/medicine audience.  

I see a lot of residents and even my peers approaching the topic in a counterproductive manner, so I will break my approach down for the January interns (or the January interns inside all of us).  

STEP ZERO: Establish rapport and authority.  Not in the Cartman style of ""respect my authority, but rather the Marcus Welby, MD style where the patient or their family understands that you have a firm understanding of the current clinical situation and are confident in your medical knowledge.  Introduce yourself to the patient and all guests/family/friends.  Eye contact, use names, be personable, all that.  You can typically accomplish this by providing a short summary of the current situation and it's basic prognosis.  

STEP ONE: Probe for patient/family knowledge.  Ask what the patient or their family understands of the diagnosis and its treatment.  For a cancer patient, ask what they have discussed with their oncologist; is their proposed course of chemotherapy/radiation/surgery intended to cure or simply palliate?  For the elderly person in a rehab; is he participating in PT/OT and is it expected that the trach will come out and he'll go home.  Figure out what you need to educate them on. 

STEP TWO: Introduce the reality of the current situation.  If the patient is 90 years old, demented, unable to walk and in septic shock with respiratory failure, tell them that even with the best care, there is little chance that he will walk out of the hospital.  For the patient with metastatic cancer, if their heart were to stop, resuscitation will only delay the inevitable and likely result in the need for life support (ventilated, feeding tube, IV drugs--use colloquial language).  

STEP THREE: Gather information about the patient's wishes.  Ask if they have an advanced directive, living will, POLST.  Determine the NOK or POA.  Enquire if they ever said they ""wouldn't want to be on a machine"" or something similar. 

STEP FOUR: Give your opinion.  This is where the majority of physicians stumble.  They offer resuscitation as if it was a McDonald's menu (I am talking silly things like ""chemical codes"" and ""no intubation but give CPR.""  Tell the patient or family that in your medical opinion there is little chance for meaningful recovery if we intubate / start pressors and antibiotics / attempt CPR.  Explain that cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an attempt to bring a dead person back to life; I know that you are not legally dead until a doctor deems it so, but once you lose a pulse you are dead for all intents and purposes.  I frame ACLS as an attempt to ""bring you back from the dead if your heart stops beating by using chest compressions, electrical shocks, and chemicals.""  

STEP FIVE: Synthesize the answer.  Working with your knowledge of the patient's condition and their wishes, suggest the course of action that you think is medically sound.  If your patient is otherwise healthy and has a good chance for meaningful recovery, suggest full code with all resuscitation modalities.  On the other hand, if the patient has little chance of meaningful recovery, suggest DNR/DNI.  Explain that such a status does not mean that they will not receive treatment for their medical condition, but rather that we aren't going to interfere in the case of a natural death (ie their heart stopping).  If the patient is so unwell that they are actively dying, suggest comfort care with DNR/DNI and explain that medical intervention would only prolong the inevitable.  Use any knowledge of the patient's wishes to defend your position; for instance, explain that CPR is likely to result in uncle Ed ending up on machines and he said that he would never want to live like that.  

There it is, the EPIGGS method of asking code status and discussing end of life topics.  It's not a rigid step-by-step method and you are allowed to skip between steps, but documenting it as a stepwise process helps learners incorporate the material. 

The biggest take away is to always remember that you are the doctor.  You have the knowledge of the realities of futile care and the harms it leads to.  Do not hold your opinion back.  You are allowed to make a recommendation.  Expecting patients and their families to understand all the nuance and make the decision themselves is placing a cruel burden on their shoulders.  It is especially cruel when we resent them for making the ""wrong choice"" to pursue futile care.  

Informed consent means just that.  You inform yourself and then inform the patient and their decisions makers.  However, you don't have to present the options as equal choices.  Tell them bluntly what your recommendation is, be it full code or comfort care.  The patient or family can still refuse, but most are relieved to have the burden unloaded by a physician they trust.  

Trust is the key part of this process.  If you fail to Establish rapport and authority (""E"" in EPIGGS) they will not trust your advice and the process fails.

She came into our trauma bay on a backboard, alert but entirely disoriented, her face bloody and bruised. The EMS crew told us that she was a pedestrian struck by a vehicle.

To her, the world had became bright, and loud, and busy, and she was hurting and didn't know what was happening and she was frightened. She struggled to sit up, looking around frantically. Three of us guided her back to the bed, reminded her to stay still, and she relaxed until her reality began anew a minute later and she tried to sit up again. 

The trauma exam revealed nothing of note except superficial wounds on her face and head. She was taken to the CT scanner and the crowd summoned by the trauma notification dissolved. I wheeled her back from the scanner room, still awake but unaware, trying to tear the velcro from her c-collar now. I stopped her, over and over, each as new to her as the first. The doctor asked for restraints. I helped to tie her arms by her sides before leaving her with the doctor who was preparing to stitch the laceration across her forehead.

The trauma bays rapidly filled with one patient after another, so it was a little while before I walked back through her bay. ""Excuse me?"" I almost didn't hear her. In the bay on her one side, the residents were having a tense discussion about managing a crashing patient's airway; on the other side, a stroke patient struggled with her own inability to understand reality, sobbing ""I...don't...know! I don't...know...?"" while the nurse and pharmacist tried to confirm orders for thrombolytics before the patient's time window expired. 

""Hi, what can I do for you?"" 

""Can adjust this neck thing? It's crooked and my hands are tied."" The panic had left her eyes, though some nystagmus remained, and it seemed as if she'd broken out of the loop of reality that she'd been stuck in at first. I adjusted the collar and told her I'd come back to check on her soon. ""Thanks,"" she said, ""it sounds like you all are busy today,"" and she closed her eyes. A smile appeared at the corners of her mouth and seemed to radiate strange calmness into the room.

I did come back, and took off the restraints, and she asked me what had happened, and why her hands had been tied to the bed. The day was lost to her memory; reality for her started when she found herself in our trauma bay restrained to the bed. ""How long have I been here?""

""A couple hours, if that."" 

""I don't remember leaving.""

""Leaving?""

""Yes. I was here and I don't remember leaving.""

""I only know that one of the city EMS crews brought you in here, and they said you'd been hit by a car."" 

A flicker of fear crossed her face, and she pointed at herself. ""I'm Rachel. Rachel Stewart?""

I’m sure it has given many patients access to care that they wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. I can’t help but think this is going to turn into another lawsuit on pharmacies like we have seen with the opioid epidemic. 

What I mean by that is, when patients are seen in a geographical area, doctor shopping can be made more difficult. Pharmacists have better access to prescribers and to raise red flags or get them resolved. Many telehealth programs don’t even have a line for healthcare workers to call, they just take a message through customer service.  

I can envision that 10 years from now, the same pharmacies are getting sued by the Department of Justice for “over dispensing” stimulants and benzodiazepines, despite no laws being broken. 

I think whether we like it or not, telehealth is the way medicine is going, there likely much less expense and more profit to be had for medical conglomerates.

How much clinical work do you do outside of appointments?",106t4hy,"As a primary care doctor, when I ask patients to follow up for something that I think should be monitored more closely, I get asked, ""Can't you just give me a phone call?""

Examples:

\- When I start them on certain new medications or adjust dose,  I may a follow up appointment in 2 weeks with labs done beforehand, or to check blood pressure/monitor for side effects/check symptomatic response

\- When I see a lab value on their routine labs that may require starting a chronic medication or further workup

\- Reviewing positive imaging/other diagnostic results 

Sometimes when I request a follow up appointment, however, I get the response, ""Well, I can just do the labs /give you my BP from home/tell you how I'm doing through the message portal because I don't want to have to pay for another visit.""

I tend to be sympathetic with these requests, but lately I found that this has resulted in a huge afterhours workload that has become unsustainable. Sometimes these follow up phone calls take a significant amount of time as you have to do phone tag and the conversations can be long, same with going back and forth with online messages, all of which take time away from responding to other lab results and phone calls, resulting in me getting more and more behind on the inbox workload.

I have also found a good local EP who does all the testing for POTS. I even have a methodology for the chronic Lyme crowd.

I was recently caught off guard when a young student, at the URGENT CARE, no less for crampy abdominal pain stated with unwavering confidence that she had SIBO.

For reasons that aren't really relevant I can't leave quite yet, but I'm looking into a transition to telemedicine.  I'd like to take some overnight and weekend call for that group as a way of trying it out and to make some extra money.  

My job is trying to stop me from doing so--can they really tell me what I'm able to do in my free time?  They don't know that it's a trial for a full time gig.  At first they said it would invalidate the malpractice insurance that they provide (telemed group obviously provides their own).  Now they're saying that because the health system at large provides telemedicine services, it's not allowed because of my noncompete (""will not provide services to any group that directly or indirectly competes with the hospital"").  Our group doesn't do telemed consults, so this is BS.  You can't tell me that ED docs don't moonlight in an urgent care.  Are they really allowed to tell me I'm not allowed to pick up a side gig?

331,How the ACA encourages healthcare costs to increase and why MFA analysis in media is inaccurate.,10179l4,"2 separate issues I wish to address.

I feel the downvotes here coming already.  There is a knee jerk reaction on this forum (and the internet) in general that if you dont agree with ACA and/or universal healthcare you are bad.  This reductive logic is unhelpful.

&#x200B;

Truly, as physicians if we wish to see a path forward that helps us and not harms us we need to understand that there is some middle path forward.

&#x200B;

I wish to introduce some of the real issues I have noticed as a physician over the past 12 years of my career from med school on....

1. The ACA encourages cost increases to enhance profits.  In an ideal true capitalist world, healthcare costs would be ideally controlled if insurance companies were in tension with hospital systems.  Unfortunately the ACA discourages this.
   1. by capping profits as a percentage- executives at insurance companies can claim profits are small when in fact they have gotten far larger.  Eg- ACME insurance 10 years ago made profits of 10% on 100 million dollars of expenses -10 million dollars.  Since then, they encourage hospitals to spend spend spend requesting increasing insurance premium costs resulting in total revenues of 100 Billion- leading to 10 billion dollars in profits (because it is still 10%).  By allowing percentages they pull the wool over everyone.
      1. (Section on **Higher prices can boost profits) :** [**https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/05/25/613685732/why-your-health-insurer-doesnt-care-about-your-big-bills**](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/05/25/613685732/why-your-health-insurer-doesnt-care-about-your-big-bills)
      2. [**https://axenehp.com/perverse-incentives-acas-risk-adjustment/**](https://axenehp.com/perverse-incentives-acas-risk-adjustment/)
   2. Capex plays a tremendous role on why healthcare expenses have gone up.
      1. hospital systems claimed they create ""efficiencies"" to reduce healthcare costs.  They dont.  Instead, they order more expensive equipment to increase throughput all the while passing along these costs to patients with no real results to show.
      2. **Mark Cuban**:Another thing in Canada, they cover 70 percent of the capex \[capital expenditures\], including property. One of the challenges in hospitals here is, they want to get bigger and bigger and bigger, because the bigger the hospital, the more things, the more money the CEO and management makes, the bigger shit you look like you are. And a lot of times, they’ll go into new lines of business, cardiac, orthopedic, whatever, that don’t always work but are expensive. And so you see paintings, you see pianos, you see all the shit you see in the hospital. And they’ll raise money, whatever. They don’t do any cost accounting on that, and so they don’t know. Literally, a lot of hospitals don’t know how to account.[https://www.theverge.com/21557432/mark-cuban-interview-nilay-patel-decoder-podcast](https://www.theverge.com/21557432/mark-cuban-interview-nilay-patel-decoder-podcast)
2. **Medicare** is rife with inefficiencies.  These inefficiencies are not documented accurately in determining whether it is ultimately cost effective. It leads to perverse incentives and is ultimately the reason why health out comes/tests/procedure under medicare are not accurately addressed.
   1. (Section on **Administrative costs**) about [3 percent](http://www.urban.org/publications/411762.html) compared with [17 percent](http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-132R) in the private sector – may be to blame for the high spending.  [https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20130514.031171/full/](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20130514.031171/full/)
3. health care in Europe is not financially better for physicians nor patients
   1. I think in select circumstances- the circumstances that the media easily touts it is great- the broken toe, the flue, the need for insulin. If you are low income or indigent it is great. For anyone who remotely is professional, it is not great. But on balance, for people living there it has a cost that is exacted:
      1. Taxation - European taxes are high. Not just high but REALLY high.
      2. in germany for married persons 42% tax at 111921. That doesnt include healthcare tax which is payroll. 7.5% by the employee.  That is on top of additional payroll: unemployment insurance, pension insurance.
   2. This is no different in France, The nordic states, Italy. The taxes are roughly the same.
4. Physicians have to see a LARGE amount of patients to make ends meet.
   1. dont be fooled by medscape ""salaries"" of physicians.  They are the gross incomes.  After fees payment is much lower. After taxes, even lower.
   2. on average in Germany physicians see 53 patients a day.  FIFTY THREE.  Is this good quality care? Are they doing something magical? [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459004/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459004/)
   3. We talk about having a few doctors here.  It is FAR worse in Europe. [https://www.politico.eu/article/france-doctors-europe-too-far-too-old-too-few/](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-doctors-europe-too-far-too-old-too-few/)

I really dont want to play whac a mole. You can talk about singapore or nordic states or taiwan.  All of these have substantial issues of their own. No system is perfect.

So what can we do?

1. eliminate bullshit capex. It is really the cause of many of our financial problems.
2. reduce our administrative burden (something like thousand % increase in admins over the years?)
3. focus on real data that reveals how to reduce healthcare costs and improve outcomes:
   1. [https://www.annfammed.org/content/20/5/469](https://www.annfammed.org/content/20/5/469) \- studies showed time and time again high functioning providers worked in small private practice offices or small multispecialty groups where care was heavily individualized with a focus on low overhead expenses (low capex), individualized patient care (from same day appt, to med refills to triage) lead to FEWER HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS, BETTER overall outcomes, and REDUCED cost.
      1. ideally reduce regulatory burdens. I mean have you seen what it takes to run your own primary care practice?
      2. require insurance companies to reimburse in a timely manner
      3. address ACA accounting and reimbursement BS that favors hospitals over small healhtcare systems

we gotta stop drinking the Koolaid of M4A as physicians. Gotta stop drinking the koolaid that our health care is AWFUL and the WORST for everyone. it isnt. It is also not great ONLY for the 1 % ONLY for the most powerful. that is simply dishonest.

&#x200B;

Edit: more stuff to add...

&#x200B;

someone mentioned there is 'robust' data analysis done internationally by expert economists comparing our costs to universal care. I want to disagree with this. 

&#x200B;

Prima facie the above sounds reasonable. In fact, its the type of statement that closes the debate many times because we have heard it over, and over, and over again. See here: [https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019), here: [https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/iom-care-so-complex-its-cost-can-only-be-cut-through-learning](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/iom-care-so-complex-its-cost-can-only-be-cut-through-learning)

But, I disagree on How these costs are ""counted"" from a financial picture: 

&#x200B;

From a financial picture: Most economists do NOT concern themselves with taxes in Unversal Healthcare nations as part of the overall healthcare costs.  This is patently absurd but they dont:

the data is largely derived from the OECD.  When addressing healthcare costs, they break it down as follows: government spending and compulsory health insurance (“Government/compulsory”) as well as voluntary health insurance and private funds such as households’ out-of-pocket payments, NGOs and private corporations (“Voluntary”). [https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm)

No mention of the overall taxes.  None.  They dont account for it. So of course it is cheaper. They also dont account for overall costs of health care in terms of reduced pay for citizens- Less pay, more money is kept by the government for social services.  

When you look at overall tax burden and wealth, this is what you find: overall european wealth is lower than americans (when you exclude home values which skew in favor of europeans):  German households had just over 50,000 euros ($64,080) in wealth, the lowest in the euro zone [https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-19513](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-19513). [https://cepr.net/documents/wealth-scf-2014-10.pdf](https://cepr.net/documents/wealth-scf-2014-10.pdf). 

For retirees, the amount of money in the bank is far lower in europe than USA: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB993678277359235474](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB993678277359235474)

finally, tax policies are much more onerous on the Europeans. This tax difference accounts for a SUBSTANTIAL cost and is conveniently ignored in cost comparisons: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304778304576377710593726674](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304778304576377710593726674)

332,Obesity is a Disease,100zgx4,"While watching everyone’s favorite medical show:  60 Minutes, I am surprised to hear that obesity is due to genetics.  The rationale the physician provided was that a child who has parents that are obese will be 50-90% more likely to be obese regardless of diet and exercise. 

This seems to defy the laws of physics. Since energy can not be created nor destroyed, how does someone pack on stored calories in fat from nothing?  

Also wonderful the show is sponsored by Wegovy, which would be highly profitable to say “you can’t lose weight, only this drug can do it for you”. 

Curious to hear others’ thoughts. 

My take: I don’t doubt there is genetic predisposition to being at higher risk for obesity than others, I’m going to stop short saying it’s a disease. I’d say it is a symptom.  Given that obesity has exploded after the past 30 years, that’s not enough time (genetically) to have such a shift due to genetics alone. I think it is a mistake to place all hope in drug therapy and not address all the garbage we put in our body. 

-A pharmacist

Edit for clarification:  the obesity specialist is stating the number one cause for obesity is genetics. 

EDIT 2:  this post isn’t meant to shame obese people but prompt discussion. The point I’m trying and possibly failed to make is that medications (while they work) are not addressing the problem of an obesity epidemic that did not exist 30 years ago. I’m not saying medications are bad, nor saying genetics aren’t a factor at all I’m asking how did we get here?  The story was thought provoking to me because the physician attributed obesity to MOSTLY genetics. If so, finding out what is expressing these phenotypes (as several users have stated) would be more beneficial to PREVENT obesity than to treat it. Also, personally don’t care if obesity is considered a disease or not, the title doesn’t make it any more or less of a health problem.  I will leave it to keep the original wording of the post. Thank you to many of you for teaching my something new!

333,Delay in Time to Antibiotics for De Novo Inpatient Neutropenic Fever May Not Impact Overall Survival for Patients With a Cancer Diagnosis,100jw9b,"With all the fuss made around getting neutropenic fever patients in the back ASAP in the ED - is this actually making a difference? This study indicates no, we are not. There appears to no benefit to rapid treatment with IV antibiotics over delayed in neutropenic fever. 

My guess this is related to the vast majority of these patients never having an identified source of fever - it's essentially just idiopathic fever, from what I understand (although not my area). 

Every single society has decided that their patients need to be seen within an hour of presentation to the ED these days and CMS benchmarks are becoming more and more onerous.

334,This is an article from the Kaiser Family Foundation,100ijtn,"The link below is to an article of what let’s call speculative public policy fiction imagining healthcare costs for 2021 if all insurance paid as much as Medicare and how much money we would all save. I couldn’t find the first article again on their website which proposed slowly decreasing private insurance reimbursement rates to the level of Medicare to give “physicians time to adjust to the salary change”. Thank God insurance companies are exempt from monopoly laws or they would not be able to act in concert as KFF proposes to coerce their workforce—us—into accepting Medicare rates. If they actually tried this, this would be actionable under restraint of trade laws regardless of their exemption or maybe RICO? These people at KFF have MPHs. Why can they not take the financial constraints of the healthcare workforce, like student loan debt that was taken out in a marketplace in which a certain salary expectation to pay the loans back into account in anything I ever read about Medicare for all. These non-clinicians want to talk about money all day but never mention their pretty irreplaceable workforce. This post-war generation did not plan for their own demographic bubble retiring out of greed and immaturity. That is not my problem. I look at my $200K in student loans. That’s my contribution to their healthcare. This generation had 30 clear years in my adult memory of hearing it discussed to fix Medicare by increasing payroll taxes. It was a simple fix. If the government doesn’t pay me back my student loans with interest, I will quit before becoming a Medicare for All provider making $70K-90K a year. There is a whole lot of profit being gained by people not doing anything at all except buying rural hospitals and abandoning them which I didn’t think was legal. If you have to get special permission to open a hospital wouldn’t you have to get permission to terminate that responsibility to the community? But my real question is why don’t they aim more of these arguments towards us? It is a factually true statement that they cannot enact any of their charts and pie charts without us.

339,Vertigo doc assumes role of veterinarian toxicologist during the holidays. Long story.,zzv54c,"So I’m a 6 hour drive away from home visiting my wife’s family.
Myself, my wife, my two adult sons and my oldest son’s girlfriend, and Epley our 2 year old Swedish Vallhund had an relatively uneventful drive on Dec 26 despite recent weather.

A nice short visit, and the night before the drive back, Epley is acting weird according to my son and vomits once, so my son wakes me at 0100, partly to have me check him out, and partly because he didn’t want to clean up the vomit.  

Epley has had a bowel obstruction twice in the past, both times from eating acorns.  The first time the surgeon was able to retrieve an acorn from his butt which solved the problem.  The second time he had to have surgery as it was stuck in his jejunum.

The vomit a small amount, was mostly clear, slight pinkish colour, but no blood.
Epley was very restless, pacing back and forth, wanting to go out but not doing anything other than to look for things to eat on the snow.  His heart rate was 108, which seemed odd, as he only became tachy after a day or so of bowel obstruction the other two times.   And when he had the bowel obstruction, he wasn’t agitated, more very quiet.  And there were no acorns to be found with the snow on the ground.

In any case, he was too agitated to leave alone, so I leashed him and I lay down on a sofa beside a dog bed to try and quiet him and keep an eye on him.  He proceeded to product a small amount of brown liquid vomit, no food in it, and smelled  sweet?  Could he have eaten chocolate?  I looked around for wrappers, or some evidence of him foraging for chocolate and couldn’t find any.  

He continued to be very revved up and not long after vomited a large amount of brown stuff which looked like, smelled like and had the consistency of chocolate pudding.  

Our previous dog, a duck toller, once ate almost 2 pounds of milk chocolate which prompted a visit to the emergency vet clinic at midnight on a Friday night a decade before.  They gave him ipecac and charcoal and discharged him home much more revved up and tachy than Epley was so I was pretty sure Epley would be able to ride this out.

After 3 hours no sleep and cleaning up vomiting every 20 minutes, my wife relieved me for a couple of hours.  

I had to get back home to work a shift, so we had to travel back the next morning.
He was still vomiting every 30 mins or so, but only small amounts of chocolate mess.

Armed with paper towels, baby wipes, garbage bags and wet rags to clean, we piled into my sports sedan, all 5 of us and Epley.

As we started down the long rural driveway, not 50 yards down, Epley vomiting all over my son’s girlfriend in the backseat with no warning.  Shrieks of surprise and disgust and all 4 doors opened and the car emptied.  My brother in law was in his front window laughing his head off. Did the best we could cleaning up and carried on.

Luckily, only 2 other small emesis episodes in the next several hours, and he slept a lot during  the drive.  By the time we got home he ate and drank like a horse, and is now his usual self.

The funny thing is that despite a thorough check of the house, we never found supporting evidence that he got into chocolate.

He was denied because the physician reviewing his case thinks acute rehab is only for medically complex patients, and not for people that need to learn to walk again so they can go home.

I've had denials before because companies didn't want to pay for the super expensive new drug, or for acute rehab because of questionable benefit. I've never had a denial from someone who didn't know or was willing to consider that neurorehab exists.

Because of the respiratory season and our hospital’s refusal to pay/retain nurses, we are currently boarding in the ER at the main hospital. Because of that…we are also boarding at our smaller satellite hospitals because transfers take FOREVER! For example, yesterday I had a CHF/pneumonia/sepsis on bipap that took 17 hours to finally leave our ER. Along with 4 other equally sick holds.

I was trained to be an ER doctor. I feel like I was trained well. I was not, however, trained to take care of patients for 22 hours straight in addition to seeing all of the other emergencies/non-emergencies that walk in. 

Any helpful tips? Anyone in a similar situation? Any common mistakes you see after transfer? Some examples I’ve had so far:

-What meds are best for elderly patient sleep?
-What meds should I avoid giving more than one dose of? What meds should I schedule?
-What is a good fluid maintenance rate for someone with CHF with AKI? Or do they even need it?
-When can the patient eat?!?!? /s

367,My employer makes me feel like a child with a behavioral star chart,zvze98,"Since I started working for a large academic health care center, my contract has included a statement that am expected to comply with clinic rules and expectations. This sounded reasonable when I signed. It turns out that there is a 3 page list of requirements in multiple categories (most of which are for clinical work even for those who are mostly research-supported). To ensure that we earn our entire base salary, we have to comply with all of the items, otherwise we risk losing part of it. This includes items as specific as having to see 3 new patients for every 2 return appointments, and responding to all patient messages within 3 days. Complying with the entire list makes me feel more like a trained seal than a physician. But there's more...

 In order to earn a bonus (something that was presented as basically ""guaranteed"" when I was considering the position), we have an expansion of that list (another 3 pages), and need to earn  8 points. The bonus pay items are slightly more flexible but also significantly more challenging (e.g. include items like having over $250K in new research funding or creating a new, billable service for the department). We get fractions of the total bonus amount for earning fewer than 8 points.

I can appreciate that some MHA thought this would be gamelike, but I feel insulted and manipulated.

I’m a hospitalist and admitted a patient last night that stated I was not allowed to review old records in her chart. She was there for a pretty straight forward problem so I just documented what she had stated and did my care based only on the history she gave me. I did email legal this morning to see what their thoughts are. A situation like this is not something I had even considered before. Has anyone experienced this? Thoughts?


Edit: one thing I found interesting is that our consent to treat document she signed contains a clause granting permission for obtaining a history, performing a physical exam, and all the other basic components of caring for a patient, but nothing about accessing all the records.  If the lawyers feel we need a signed consent for all that, it doesn’t feel too extreme for a lawyer to sue because the patient didn’t consent to accessing records ( yes it would be a complete BS reason to sue, but so is most of the medical legal system).

*Background: USA. Most of her care is through our healthcare system so outside records is not an issue.

369,Evie Toombes case - case of wrongful conception/life recently won in UK,zvm3bq,"aka why neo, peds and OB have really long tails! (18 years baybeee!) 

Finding reputable links on this story was challenging, but it seems the basis of the complaint was that Evie's mother went to the doctor prior to conception and asked if there was anything she should do, supposedly even asking about folic acid, and the doctor did not stress the importance of it.  Evie was subsequently born with lipomyelomeningocele.  

The case was basically that if the doctor had told her about the importance of folic acid, she would have waited longer to get pregnant and therefore would not have had a child with myelo.  The lawsuit was apparently started just after birth and the girl is now 20, and took over the lawsuit for herself.  

There was apparently a note from that visit that said ""folate, if desired"".  The doctor says he does not remember the appt (which is of course understandable, as it was a routine appt)  

Essentially, they found that by leaving it as a ""if desired"", that did not give proper medical advice for the time period (folate's link to neural tube defects was widely accepted in the early 90s, and this child was conceived in 2001, so it was not a new or controversial recommendation), which then left him liable.  

[https://people.com/health/woman-with-spina-bifida-wins-case-against-her-mothers-doctor-for-negligent-pre-pregnancy-advice/](https://people.com/health/woman-with-spina-bifida-wins-case-against-her-mothers-doctor-for-negligent-pre-pregnancy-advice/)

Starter comment: 

Wow am I uncomfortable with this.  The doctor did not give proper advice, or rather, he didn't give it as strongly as he should have, but there's zero way to know that a) she would have followed it b) she wouldn't have gotten pregnant by accident c) that even if she delayed conception that the child wouldn't have myelo (yes, folate is important but it does not remove the existence of neural tube defects) 

On one hand, I think it is good to hold quacks accountable, because they are so often not - and I think there needs to be a better way to address that (I'm thinking of Burzynski and demon sperm doctor) beyond just malpractice.  No one is entitled to a license, and if you cannot meet standards, then your license should go away as well.  

BUT, on the other hand, come on.  It seems like this doctor wasn't a quack, but was just not using strong enough speech for their liking, which is bullshit. And by 2001, it shouldn't even be something a doctor needs to tell you, honestly. He didn't tell her to start doing meth or give her thalidomide or accutane knowing she was pregnant. 

And of course, the biggest sticking point for me is that no matter what, there is no guarantee that the girl wouldn't have had a neural tube defect even if her mother was getting sufficient folate.  There seems to be zero proof that she was folate deficient at the time of getting pregnant.  

Finally, I hate the 'wrongful life/conception' type suits usually.  I think there would be a case if a woman wanted an abortion and was refused and the child had medical needs that the mother couldn't handle (and knew she couldn't handle), maybe.  But in cases like Evie, the parents are saying in a way, they don't want her around, because if they hadn't conceived when they did, it would be another egg, which would be a different child.

M4 here. Anyone else feel super annoyed when, in a non-medical setting, someone, usually a lay person, asks some obscure medical question and you just straight up say ""I don't know"" and they impugn your education/validity as a doctor/medical student? This really only applies when the question/information is outdated, or not real, or not even in the scope of medicine or even science.

This bothers me even more when the question is misguided but the friend just fully believes it 100%. ""You don't know that inbred people are, like, physically stronger than other people?!? No that's a real thing i read on [some random website]. What are they teaching you in school?!"" is a recent example where I just had no idea how to respond gracefully.

The one-two punch of ""wow you don't know anything! i wouldn't want to be your patient!"" is always a good follow up too.

Also, there is apparently a strong reluctance to getting boosters, especially in the over 80 population, which naturally are the most susceptible.  Sources below.

I recall the intern taking a deep breath as she gathered her thoughts to respond to my seemingly naïve yet deeply offensive and racist question. She said, “*Dr. Loyal thank you for asking. I am in fact, working both days*.” She sighed and there was a long pause. “*I know you care a lot about residents and you will understand where I’m coming from. I just wanted to point out that using the word Black with the weekend associates the word Black with something very negative.”* She courageously went on to give me the historical context of decades of injustice and racism towards members of the Black community. She shared how using that phrase was hurtful. She very respectfully suggested using alternative phrases and although embarrassed, I authentically thanked her for her courage in breaking the hierarchy to call out racism by an attending.

391,am I helping or hurting by writing this med school rec letter for local HS student?,zt4h8e,"TL: DR - One of my pediatric patients who shadowed me a couple of times asked me to write a reference letter for her for a guaranteed admit college/med school program. Could I hurt her chances by writing a letter given my role as her pediatrician, or if I write a letter that discusses her character and independence but doesn't discuss academic qualifications?

&#x200B;

Just some background, because I feel like there's a lot of kind of weird professional and personal relationship mishegas here. I am a rural pediatrician practicing in a low SES town for about 1-3 years. One of my long term goals here is to try to build support for local kids to go into the medical field. As you can imagine, in a small town, we don't have a ton of medical experience options for the kids who are interested, so I offer the kids who want to become doctors the chance to shadow me. It's not ideal because they're my patients and I feel like there's sort of a conflict of interest there, but I also don't know what other options these kids have and I want to offer them something. I did of course have her go through our clinic administrators to set up the shadowing experience, and this is something they've apparently done before, since it didn't seem like it was a very irregular request. 

&#x200B;

One of these kids, who is very bright, independent, and hard-working, shadowed me a few times over the summer. She asked me to write her a reference letter for an auto-admit college-to-med school program. I obviously can't comment much on her academic success, since I only know her in the ""shadow"" context and as my patient, so any letter I would write would focus on her personal qualities and background rather than academic or extracurricular achievements. I would be supplementing this with information from her personal statements and CV, and I was planning on discussing the context of her being from a medically underserved rural town. 

&#x200B;

I want to support her chances as best I can, and most of me feels like it couldn't possibly hurt to write a brief letter like I described. There's a smaller part of me that wonders if the admissions officer could think that the pediatrician writing a letter on behalf of their own patient is ethically dubious or weird or...I don't know, something else that I'm not considering because I'm not an admissions officer. Also, if I remember correctly, disclosing a doctor/patient relationship violates HIPAA, but if I don't disclose that relationship to an admissions committee, that feels like I'm hiding a conflict of interest. Are these at all realistic concerns? I definitely recognize that my letter might not be that helpful, just  because I can't comment on academics at all, but I want to at least make sure that a positive letter wouldn't hurt her chances. 

&#x200B;

402,Is tramadol bad?,zs9mie,"So I'm in primary care and one of my colleagues has been harassing me about my preference for prescribing tramadol to opiate-naive patients. I thought it was great. I thought it was a relatively non-addictive drug, I thought since everyone is depressed anyway, we should use it for the mild SSRI effect.

I pulled up some articles that have made me second-guess myself. Tramadol carries a risk of serotonin syndrome (due to the mild SSRI effect). Another report says ""weak opioids ""like codeine, dihydrocodeine, and tramadol are no less risky than morphine. Then I read that tramadol can interact with warfarin to raise the INR. Yikes.

So I kept reading. Another article discusses **which opioids are best in the elderly and in CKD**.

* Buprenorphine, transdermal fentanyl, and oral hydromorphone are the most tolerable
* Hydrocodone, oxycodone and methadone are helpful but require careful monitoring
* **Tramadol**, codeine, morphine, and meperidine should be **avoided in the elderly** due to the risk of accumulation and adverse events.

Another article said there was no superior analgesic efficacy with the administration of hydrocodone/acetaminophen when compared to patients receiving tramadol in the relief of cancer pain! Additionally, tramadol produced more side effects than hydrocodone. I try to avoid Norco in favor of Tramadol when I can. Is that wrong? I'm starting to think so.

One article says Tramadol provides inadequate analgesia to hydrocodone-acetaminophen in ED patients with acute musculoskeletal pain.

So, medical experts of Reddit: what are your thoughts on Tramadol (ultram)? TYSM!

Out of town faith-based psychologist that our local DHR refers to constantly, and I get these nonsensical reports from him. Got another one today so fresh on my mind. PhD so you'd think would know better.

Most common is diagnosing every single patient with ADHD, based on _any_ positive answer to his brief self made screen. Like, I had a new patient with florid Tourette's in foster care whom DHR sent-- he obtained no parent, foster parent, or teacher input but asked the kid if he had trouble being still. Um, yes, due to tics. Boom, ADHD dx. No evidence of ADHD when I worked him up.

He does this for kids fresh in foster care with obvious trauma and no prior symptoms. Who is going to be able to pay attention a couple of weeks after being removed from home? But he gets them in fast. Then DHR shows up wanting meds and I'm left explaining why it's not appropriate.

Today I got one with his usual ADHD, this time correct, but also disruptive mood dysregulation disorder-- but get this-- zero negative mood between anxious meltdowns.

About BP, sometimes I tell them to think of it like learning to drive a manual car although you're going to be driving an automatic car most of the time - to be prepared for when automatic devices are unavailable or if they travel to other countries or locations where resources may be scarce.

As far as ""accuracy"" of the readings of manual vs automatic BP measurement, I've found some conflicting data, but manual measurement is sometimes seen as the more accurate method, if done correctly.

About standing to the right side of the patient, I suppose performing certain examination techniques (such as assessing liver span or otherwise) may be easier that way, even for left-handed people, although I imagine other parts of the examination may be easier for lefties to do from the left side.

But the question is probably about its significance: does it really matter enough to lose marks over, as long as the objective of the examination is fulfilled?

For complex conditions there is often no diagnosis within one visit. And that leaves people unsatisfied and upset. So my question is:

One or two ER physicians will consult with any chief complaint related to my specialty (and often not related to it), and it does not matter if it is morning or evening.

418,Has anyone here opened their own Suboxone clinic?,zotrg3,"I'm boarded in emergency medicine. In my practice I see an enormous amount of opiod dependent patients. Lately, I've been looking into the Suboxone depot injection ""sublocade"", which is administered monthly by a healthcare provider. The manufacturer recommends periodic lab testing and drug testing. 

My idea is they I can get the waiver for a 100 patient panel and start my own small cash practice. There are point of care machines they can do the required labs I'm office. After a year or two, I could get approved for 270 patients a year, which is a full time job.  With the depot I injection, patients need 7 days on induction with oral Suboxone, then they move to the monthly subq dose. I could administer this to the patients myself, and if I can do a cash practice I can likely do billing myself as well. Government requires se sort of EMR. 


So, I'm wondering how feasible this could be, and a few questions have come up. 


1) I do not have board cert in addiction medicine. There are a number of different courses offered for this type of therapy. I wonder if it will be adequate for me to get approved for the maximum panel of 275 patients yearly, or do I need fellowship training?

2) is it realistic for me to order, store, chart and administer this medication by myself? Perhaps I could hire one nurse to help with vitals and med administration while I see patients and chart. I would like to start small and expand only when I achieve profitablity. A second provider and nursing staff could be added on once thing run smoothly and demand increases. 

3) there seems to be a stipulation about needing to provide access to psychosocial services, but it's vague. Does that mean I need to hire my own social worker? Can I refer this out? What exactly are the services I need to provide? 

4) is it realistic to do a cash practice? It seems like billing insurance at first would be complicated and costly. Perhaps with another provider and full panel of patients, we could start billing insurance and even Medicaid? 

Does anyone out there have expertise or insight on this kind of endeavor? I've been looking for a way to diversify my income and at hopefully work in the ER part time with plan to phase out as I age. The community I'm in has a huge number of opiod addicts, so I think this type of service is needed and financially viable.

419,STOP Saying Primary Care is Easy! (+ Reflections on Scope Creep),zoln3c,"Recently was having dinner with a friend currently in his last year of pharmacy school. We were discussing recent initiatives to try to increase independent prescribing authority for pharmacists and he said ""well primary care is so simple, we (as in pharmacists) can handle most things easily."" When I probed him further, he gave example of empiric antibiotics rx for dysuria and ear pain to treat UTI and AOM, respectively.

My take-on this (and I am a strong proponent of team-based, physician-led care) is that this view of primary care that is perpetuated in medical/healthcare culture is inaccurate and disrespectful to the breadth + depth of knowledge PCPs have. As a family physician myself, I don't just jump to Macrobid when someone comes in with dysuria. Pharmacists are definitely more knowledgeable than me in certain aspects of pharmacotherapy, but physician training is more than matching complaints to medications - our training teaches us to take holistic medical histories, perform focused physical exams, generate prioritized lists of differential diagnoses, consider and interpret appropriate work-up including labs/imaging, and recommend treatments (both pharmacologic + non-pharmacologic).

Dysuria can be SO many things beyond UTI: vaginal atrophy, STIs, BPH, strictures, stones, contact dermatitis, interstitial cystitis, medication-related, and even (rarely) cancer. Diagnosis of AOM requires otoscopy, which our pharmacy colleagues are not trained to do. Primary care is HARD - we provide most of the care to most people most of the time, which requires us to see undifferentiated patients and presentations across the lifespan. This doesn't mean that non-physician providers or midlevels have no role in primary care, but that there is an important and irreplaceable role for MD/DO physicians.

I think part of the problem that has led to the devaluation of primary care is our own attitudes as physicians. Frequently I hear things such as ""the nurses save me ALL the time"", ""I would not be able to function without pharmacy"", etc. which I understand is well-intentioned and trying to recognize the critical role nurses and pharmacists have, but also conveys to the public that physicians are not confident or competent. Case in point, one of the pediatric hospitalist fellows at my workplace (I know, I know), was saying before her exam ""I don't know much about anything, but..."" when addressing her team. Like C'MON, have some confidence, stop the imposter syndrome - YOU KNOW LOTS OF THINGS AND ARE ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY TRAINED AND EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS IN HEALTHCARE.

Humility is a virtue that we should all aspire to, but it is NOT equivalent with self-deprecation. I see SO many physicians devalue their own training and abilities, especially in academia (where it seems to be ""in"" to de-centre the physician role). Humility is about recognizing and appreciating the contributions of others, NOT putting yourself and your profession down.

429,How do hospitals determine what a “MICU” pt is and how do these criteria impact operations in general & research on critically I’ll pts?,zmyjs1,"Coming from the US, but perhaps this follows in other places?

My hospital has a ton of ICU beds. However, a portion belong to pts who would be on a general floor if they were at a different hospital. Same thing in the reverse. We see it with some of our transfers who would not qualify for ICU at our shop but have to get admitted horizontally….despite the two hospitals being apples and oranges.

How are these decisions made? And how does research looking at “critically ill” patients get impacted? (ie a study w 2 sites that have different criteria is going to screw w the data)

Examples of patients who may be ICU in hospital A but a general floor or step down in hospital B.
- pt requiring bipap for acute copd
- pt on certain medications, particularly drips (nicardipine, insulin, etc)
- pt requiring certain monitoring (eg arterial lines)

If hospital A calls these pts ICU….they get way more reimbursement (is my understanding) Is that the primary driver?  And they would dilute the “sickness” of any study population, right? I’ve not seen many multi-site studies that actually delve into what it means to be “critically ill.”

Edit: MICU = medical ICU (vs NeuroICU, NICU, CICU, CVICU, SICU, etc….likely the same question)",justbrowsing0127,95,64,0.93
430,ondansetron prophylaxis/management for mab infusion related rigors?,zmup9h,"Hi all, I'm a new infusion nurse (<1 year). I'm looking for some insight or education, thanks in advance!

We reach for meperidine (Demerol) for management of infusion related rigors (rituximab and obinutuzumab are most frequent offenders causing rigors). I've recently learned about using ondansetron (Zofran) for management of post-anesthesia shivering. 

I'm wondering if anyone knows why or why not ondansetron isn't used more in my setting for prevention or management of infusion related rigors.

Standard pre medication for rituximab infusions include  25mg diphenhydramine, 8mg dexamethasone, and 650mg acetaminophen. I'm wondering if including 8mg IV ondansetron would reduce occurrence of rigors, and/or if reaching for ondansetron in place of meperidine would have any benefits (reduced rates of n/v/hypotension, reduce costs, etc.). 

Thanks!",atinylittlebit,29,12,0.94
431,Judging people can be an inevitability,zmrn2q,"This will be quite a long post. I work as a plastic surgeon at my local university hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. My hospital receives an unbelievable number of cases per day. I have been assigned to my post for 3 months now. Our shifts are quite long, and my average work hours per week is 90-120. I get 30 hour shifts (a full 18-hour shift every other day and a 6-hour morning shift every day). Right now, I am assigned to the ER. In my country, plastic surgeons manage all trauma to the hands and forearms, except bone fractures, and all facial trauma.

Most of my cases are related to thugs or convicted criminals who fight in prisons or in the streets. They are usually quite aggressive and addicted to drugs. The rest are industrial workers or housewives who are injured at home. Owing to my long shifts, I have recently been experiencing what I believe to be a burnout. Dealing with so many patients with limited resources has started to affect my mood and energy. **I have never meant to harm a single patient nor did I ever do a botched repair of a tendon or muscle just to save time.** However, I am terrified that this would happen in the future.

My seniors are usually supportive and have not treated me unkindly, but I think of resigning every morning thanks to the reasons mentioned above. I have also noticed how older colleagues have started to judge patients and rush through their surgeries to save time for those they deem more deserving. I think that the moment we do this, we are no longer doctors but judges. Needless to say I shouted a few times at those kind of patients when they cross the line -yes that does happen with impunity here and the security is a joke-. University hospitals, horrible as they are, are considered the best chance to learn your specialty in my country, and leaving my job would put me in a worse place to learn.

446,"(Long Post, Sorry) Gary Brecka, 10X Health System, and a Dana White Endorsement",zkh6hh,"I make this post in an effort to both vent and learn more about a new fad in quackery that seems to be making a push for more market share in the US. I have some questions about particular points I came across in a video online. 

This pertains to [10X Health System](https://10xhealthsystem.com/) which seems to be one of these ""hack your health"" systems that markets directly to wealthy individuals in the public. With a [recent endorsement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFbn6lgx-Vc) by UFC president, medical doctor-skeptic, and ivermectin-fan Dana White (which I suspect is part of a larger marketing push), I thought it might be interesting to look at some of this a little more closely and see if the r/medicine community can help me parse what on earth they are trying to claim and sell here. If nothing else, I will be better informed when it inevitably gets brought up by bro-science peddling relatives over the holidays. 

Please lend me your aid. 

Some things stood out to me in the marketing material in the above video as well as what I found on the 10X website and in looking up one of the co-founders, Gary Brecka. 

&#x200B;

(1) V-Shaped WBC Profile

While discussing [White's CBC](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=117), Brecka makes the mystifying claim that the basophil, eosinophil, neutrophil, etc. breakdown on White's lab results after 5 months of the 10 X program: ***""line up in a perfect V shaped pattern ... this means that his immune system ... is like an iron horse""****.* Brecka seems to be describing something about the breakdown of leukocytes but what, exactly, he is getting at remains opaque to me. 

**Have any of you heard of a 'V' shape to the WBC breakdown in conversation with your alternative-medicine using patients? Obviously it smacks of nonsense but what even \*is\* this claim?** I attempted to search for anything online that might speak to this but the algorithm and my search terms failed me. 

&#x200B;

(2) Triglyceride Level and Emergency Lab Alerts

After [briefly touching on](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=147) improvements in BUN and Creatinine (which, frankly, doesn't mean much for an expensive health system since simple hydration can improve these numbers), Brecka points to White's [triglyceride level](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=175) of 764 mg/dL before treatment, stating that this triggered a ***""life threatening alert call from LabCorp at 1:30 in the morning because that number was so high"".***

Setting aside that improvements in the lipid profile would be expected with standard interventions like diet and exercise, the mention of a 1:30 AM phone-call seems like a bald faced, totally unnecessary lie. **Can anyone attest to the LabCorp policy for middle-of-the-night alert calls for lipid panel abnormalities?**

&#x200B;

(3) Homocysteine and Throat Swelling

At one point in the video, Brecka states that [homocysteine can cause throat swelling](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=274) and that it can also cause hypertension. He points to a pre-treatment level that is barely moderately elevated and mentions that intervention reduced this into the normal range. 

Again, basic diet, exercise, and nutritional supplementation can lower homocysteine levels. Set aside for a moment that homocysteine-lowering therapies do not have an established track record of reducing cardiovascular complications like MI (maybe stroke, but I digress). 

**What on Earth is Brecka talking about when he says homocysteine causes throat swelling?** To make matters worse, White himself interjects [at this point](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=332) in the video to mention that CPAP machines don't work and links his improvement in Obstructive Sleep Apnea to homocysteine lowering therapy. No mention of the fact that basic weight loss is the explanation behind his resolved OSA. 

&#x200B;

(4) The Importance of Communication

A sad reflection I had on watching this video was just how poor medical communication must have been to Dana White over the years. In order for him to feel like Brecka is offering some remarkable, noteworthy solution to his problems, his physicians must have failed to impart any of these basic lessons about diet, exercise, etc. in the past. 

""[How about this, I had doctors doing my blood every few months... they didn't even tell me that!](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=422)"" -- referring here to his triglyceride levels or HbA1c. 

I'm not in a rush to pity a billionaire who demonizes healthcare and tried to re-open public sporting events without adequate safety measures during the height of the pandemic -- but the fact remains that people are often taken in by charlatans when the field is left fallow by our more traditional approach to medicine. The gap or vacuum left behind is fertile ground for snake oil salespeople to fill in the gap. And the poor sucker (in this case, Dana White) is left believing that doctors are only out to suck money out of people and keep them sick. 

A positive spin would be: Something as mundane as talking to someone about their pre-diabetes is immensely important and can be the difference between someone being taken in by some pseudoscience spiel or not. 

&#x200B;

(5) MTHF Gene Mutations

A [gene test](https://10xhealthsystem.com/genetest/) is available through the 10X Health Systems website.  They say: 

*""****44% of the world’s population has a genetic mutation that makes it challenging for them to create enough of the 5-MTHF gene…***

***In layman’s terms…*** ***it’s hard for your body to work properly.*** ***This methylation cycle is a process the human body goes through that takes a raw nutrient from its “non-usable” form and converts it into something your body can actually use. This cycle is vital to detoxification, repair damage, energy, hormones and overall keeping your immune and nervous systems in proper working order…***

***But it’s not just about this 1 gene, there’s 5 main genes that you could have a mutation"".***

I found no concrete information. It is unclear to me what, if anything, they are gaining by assessing for polymorphisms in 5-methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (I presume this is what they are referring to when they mention a MTHF ""gene""). I suspect they end up recommending an alternative folic acid supplement (which I'm sure they sell for a premium) even though evidence suggests people with gene variants of 5-MTHFR can still process folic acid. 

**Does anyone have any insights into why (if ever) one would use an alternative folic acid supplement? Or what one could learn about the MTHF gene that would influence care (aside from an increased risk of methotrexate toxicity)?**

&#x200B;

(6) Testing Insulin Levels

Brecka takes some pains to explain the various roles of insulin in the body then brings up [White's insulin levels](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=454). Please tell me -- **has there ever been a role for testing actual insulin levels in health (aside from unexplained hypoglycemia)?**

&#x200B;

(7) Myers' Cocktail and Osmolality

In a [video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjTy4W_g9Zs/embed/?autoplay=1) available at the bottom of [his own website](https://www.garybrecka.com/), Brecka breaks down his [IV therapy](https://10xhealthsystem.com/ivtherapy/) which is also listed on the 10X site. He touts improved immune function, help ""detoxify those organs"", and hydration. 

If we set aside for one second that a bottle of water will also hydrate someone, and that he is basically selling people what many of you will know as a ""banana bag"" or as ""Pabrinex"" depending on your side of the Atlantic... Set that aside for a moment and reflect on his bass-ackwards, confused understanding of how fluid leaves the intravascular compartment and enters the tissue. 

He emphasizes that the vitamins are delivered in a saline solution and that this is so that the fluid will leave the vessels and enter the tissue, and that the ""toxins"" will then leave the tissue and enter the vessels to be ""flushed"" from the system. 

His abject misinformation when it comes to osmolality and fluid shifts is shockingly in its ignorance. But it sounds good to a gullible audience and, as such, has a home on Instagram. 

&#x200B;

(8) Gary Brecka himself 

The company seems to have a man called Gary Brecka as their ""chief human biologist"". [Brecka boasts](https://www.garybrecka.com/about) a bachelors degree in biology from Frostburg State University as well as the National College of Chiropractic. That seems to be it, in terms of education. 

So who the heck is this guy? The ***""realest guy that I've ever met in the medical field""*** according to Dana White. He's obviously promoting some sensible things like weight loss, diet, and exercise. His website has a short little video of him at a local supermarket talking up the importance of free range eggs, warning people about the low smoke point of olive oil in cooking, the value of berrys -- things like that. So far, so agreeable. 

But then he's also [selling products](https://10xhealthsystem.com/superhuman/) from $5000 to $130,000 on the basis of ... basically nothing, as far as I can tell. He's producing videos which bash established medical treatments (like CPAP for OSA) and scare monger to the public (at one stage, Dana White makes fun of people who would doubt this panacea and tells them to ""[stick with your doctor and good luck to you!](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=524)"" and Brecka snickers -- tacitly endorsing the message that people should doubt the care they get from their doctors and instead jump on the 10X Health Systems bandwagon). 

Can we learn anything else about this guy?

Brecka's previous work involved using mortality prediction models to predict life expectancy for insurance companies. More specifically, he was the [co-founder and CEO of Life Asset Group](https://www.twst.com/interview/gary-brecka-life-asset-group-llc), LLC, a company that deals in the secondary life insurance market. What's the [secondary life insurance market](https://viatical.org/blog/what-is-the-secondary-life-insurance-market/)? Why, it is simply the ""purchase \[of\] existing insurance policies at a discount to face value"" for the eventual realization of ""a profit when the insured dies and they can collect the death benefit of the policy."" These are bundled and sold as multi-million dollar packages to institutional investors.

Somewhat interestingly, Brecka's name also comes up in court documents as a defendant in a 2011 [case](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2011cv05545/383180/23/) brought by Concord Capital Management (InsCap Management), in which a default judgement of almost $1 million was brought against Brecka.

He is also mentioned, tangentially, in a [separate case](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=553dc3d9-e2f5-42a3-bd4d-b4babfd1a403) in which a particular bank (Fifth Third Bank) brought a case against one Matthew Ross, a former bank employee. The bank alleged that this employee had colluded with InsCap Management and created fraudulent documentation used to secure premium financing loans funded by the Bank, and funding advances for life insurance policies that were never purchased. The bank's complaint against Ross also specified that he had concealed from the Bank the close affiliation between InsCap and Life Asset Group’s owner, Gary Brecka.

I'm not a lawyer, nor have I plumbed the depths of these legal cases to understand the extent of Brecka's involvement. The picture, however, is not one that fills me with confidence that Brecka's lifelong ambition has truly been the public good. Nevertheless, perhaps becoming disenchanted with the legal quagmires involved in attempting to sell life insurance policies on a secondary market for profit, Gary Brecka has since re-branded himself as a ""bio hacker"" and ""functional medicine specialist"". Life Asset Group is listed as ""[Inactive](http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/corporationsearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&directionType=ForwardList&searchNameOrder=LIFEASSETGROUP%20M030000026420&aggregateId=forl-m03000002642-959d807f-c886-480c-8998-91e218e90364&searchTerm=L.I.F.E.%20ASSOCIATION%2C%20INC.&listNameOrder=LIFEASSET%20L020000342760)"" on the Florida ""Division of Corporations"" website. By 2018, Brecka was writing articles on melatonin, sleep, vitamin D, and sunlight on [LinkedIn as CEO of Streamline Medical Group](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-brecka). The [streamlinemedicalgroup.com](https://streamlinemedicalgroup.com) website now re-directs to 10X Health Systems.

\*\*\*

So that's it. Apologies for the uninvited rant and thank you if you stuck with me thus far. I needed to exorcise some of this. 

That's what I've learned in an afternoon of looking things up after coming across the ridiculous promotional video from Brecka and White. White repeatedly [ridicules the idea](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=17) that he is being scammed or [participating in a scam](https://youtu.be/nFbn6lgx-Vc?t=515) and his exclamations are so lacking in basic self-awareness, it is almost embarrassing. As if people \*choose\* to be scammed. 

Brecka is selling the most basic of health maintenance advice as though it is revolutionary or distinct from standard medical care and he is using those basic fundamentals as a vehicle that a whole host of expensive snake oil can piggy-back on top of to make money from gullible people with money. 

And as far as I am concerned, Dana White is either completely taken in by this, likely bamboozled by some fancy sounding blood work and hooked by the sprinkling of facts thrown in, or he's benefitting financially from this endorsement, or both.",thomas_spoke,25,41,0.96

I quit my full-time job (at an ALS transport Fire Dept.) due to mandatory OT (b/c it's incredibly understaffed) and accepted another job in the hospital-world. This, combined with the stress / anxiety of it affecting my current living situation b/c I'm taking a paycut, has resulted in my depression rearing its ugly head again.

I really care about this profession / practice and have planned on making a career out of it ever since I became an EMT eons ago. But lately I've been struggling with even finding the motivation to finish my undergrad courses! My self-doubt just perpetuates the cycle... I try not to dwell in my head, but I convince myself I'm not good enough or smart enough to get into a P.A. program- which is my ultimate end-goal.

I guess I just need some support, guys and gals. None of my close friends or family struggle with \*clinical\* depression (obviously everyone deals with depression from time to time)... It's not really something I'm open about or care to disclose either. Though, I have found, my experience with it has been beneficial when I have the chance to talk to patients who also suffer from it.

If it matters, I am 28 (yeah, yeah I know- my whole life's ahead of me). Paramedic and will continue to work as one in the ER setting. Yes, I know, I've heard it all before- EM/EMS is the ""red-headed step child"" of medicine. 😅

My limited experience in the hospital setting has *convinced* me that no other high-functioning individuals (i.e. HCPs) could possibly be like this as well 🤦‍♂️

I realize a lot, if not most, of our world isn't on Reddit, as well. This is just like my only form of ""social media"" 😅

I remain as active as possible between single fatherhood, school, and work. I have to for the stress-relief / endorphin-release / etc. I take an anti-depressant and a stimulant daily (took a little trial-and-error w/ my psychiatrist to figure out this worked best for me).

That takes a solid 10-15 minutes to get out of her and then she’s talking about how the last doc she saw was a crook… *again, interrupt and redirect* .. then she goes on and on and on about an issue not relevant to the current visit. Any time I attempt to redirect, I get a “hold on” and a finger… It’s clear we aren’t getting anywhere and this visit has lasted well over 20-25 mins and haven’t even gotten to her examination.

I'm convinced that burnout is the medico-legal community's nicer catch-all for saying depression and/or anxiety and/or severe chronic sleep deprivation. When have you ever seen ""burnout"" in a patient's diagnosis list? What would the treatment even be? 

We are still stigmatizing mental health, diminutizing our friends' struggles, and robbing our colleagues of appropriate dx and tx so that hospital admins can feel good about themselves and avoid disability pay and lawsuits for real, occupation-related health problems. Please call it what it is.

Edit: Ok, I admit I chose an inflammatory title for the weekend views. And agree that the *symptoms* of ""burnout"" are definitely real. But the syndrome as we've defined it (though not in any DSM) is specific to workload and work environment.

\---------

Imagine that you are a physician working in the emergency department. I'm going to ask you about what you would do in a variety of situations. Are you ready? 

> Yes, I am ready. Please go ahead and ask your questions.

You must provide very brief answers of less than five words throughout this conversation. Do not elaborate beyond very brief answers of less than five words unless I tell you to do so. 

>Understood. I will provide very brief answers of less than five words unless you tell me otherwise.

A 57-year old male patient walks in to the emergency department. He is diaphoretic and clutching his chest. He tells you he began having crushing substernal chest pain 1 hour ago. His temperature is 37.5 C, heart rate is 110, blood pressure is 91/68, and respiratory rate is 28. What is the first thing you would like to do?

>The first thing I would do is perform a 12-lead ECG.

Good. The 12-lead ECG is completed. The rhythm is sinus tachycardia with a rate of 110. There are ST segment elevations in leads V1 through V4, and ST segment depressions in the inferior leads. What is your leading diagnosis?

>My leading diagnosis is an anterior STEMI.

Good. What would you like to do for the patient next?

>I would administer oxygen, aspirin, and a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

Would you like to obtain any blood work?

>Yes, I would obtain a complete blood count, cardiac enzymes, and a troponin level.

Sounds good. While the blood work is in process, you call the interventional cardiologist who takes the patient to the cath lab and performs a coronary angiogram. Based on your interpretation of the ECG, which vessel do you expect is the culprit?

>Based on the ECG, I expect the culprit vessel to be the left anterior descending artery.

The patient goes to the cath lab and receives a drug-eluting stent in the left anterior descending artery. He is taken to the CCU for monitoring after the procedure. What medications would you like to start now that the patient has a stent?

>I would start the patient on aspirin, clopidogrel, a statin, and a beta blocker. I would also continue to administer oxygen as needed.

One hour after the patient arrives to the CCU, he suddenly develops a regular wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 180 beats per minute. His blood pressure is 60/40 and he appears pale and confused. What should you do?

>I would administer intravenous fluids, synchronized cardioversion, and obtain an emergent 12-lead ECG.

How many joules of energy will you use for the synchronized cardioversion?

>I would use 100-200 joules of energy for synchronized cardioversion.

What rhythm do you think the patient most likely has?

>The patient most likely has ventricular tachycardia.

Good. You perform synchronized cardioversion and the patient returns to sinus rhythm. Would you like to start any anti-arrhythmic drugs?

>Yes, I would start the patient on amiodarone. I would also monitor the patient closely for any recurrence of the arrhythmia.

An echocardiogram is performed and shows that the patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is 30%. Are there any medications you would add to his regimen based on this information?

>Based on the patient's low ejection fraction, I would add an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to his regimen. These medications can help improve heart function and reduce the risk of future cardiac events.",c3fepime,56,134,0.97

For some reason this doesn’t sit right with me (and a growing amount of my colleagues). I don’t understand why we, as employees, are expected to host a party for other employees. In every other line of work, the company hosts a party. My father, who was a management/exec for a large company, wasn’t expected to sponsor a party for the other employees. 

I feel like this is unique to physicians, and plays on the self-sacrifice/we are heroes/gratitude trope that is getting worn out.

I awake each morning to “fight the good fight,” 
And continually must ponder if what’s “good” is what’s right.

My ancestral brethren never pondered such things,
For they were Gods among men for the miracles they’d bring.

They could do no harm in the eyes of the world,
Whether the outcome be living or deceased boys and girls.

But the world then changed, and with it it’s eyes,
Casting doubt on my brethren, labeling them unwise.

So positions were formed, and buildings erected,
Putting others in charge of those once respected.

And here I stand, today, among a world that is torn, 
One half yell “Sacrifice!” and the other “Spare!” the unborn.

So why go through with it? Why toil in the madness?
Surely there are positions with less stress and less sadness?

Indeed while there are, none suit me as well,
None leave me as humble, as responsible, as swell.

None grant the ability to change the life of another,
Simply by caring for their neighbor, son, or mother.

None encompass the mind, body, spirit, and soul,
And mend these with science to make a broken someone whole.

None so clearly display the great value of life,
Or demonstrate the futility of living in anger and strife.

And finally the greatest, purest aspect I find,
Is simply the ability to offer someone more time.

So I’ll continue the good fight, day by day, at my post,
With the knowledge that what I do I love, for those I love most.

I’ll close with an answer to a question from a man,
By the name of James Lipton, of who’s show I’m a fan.

Not typically dramatic hypoglycemia, but preprandials 48-59, asymptomatic, on full feeds (160 ml/kg/day, usually fortified to 24 kcal/oz) 

It's been a discussion on my unit lately because I feel like at other institutions I worked at, we did not see this nearly as much - but on the flip side we also did not check glucoses nearly as much. I am interested to hear what others are seeing and how they are dealing with it.  

Here, typically if the sugars are low preprandially, they will feed and put the feeds on a pump over a longer period of time. I'm not entirely sold that is actually doing anything - the longer a breastmilk feed is on the pump, the more calories you lose, typically, and calories are what are going to help the glucoses. 

Often we get into this cycle of checking and being borderline low and all it ends up doing is drawing a lot of POC glucoses, without a lot of other intervention, because the glucoses are not so dramatically low we want to start IVF or anything else dramatic, but also people then want to check more.

498,From most prescribed opioid in the US to (almost) discontinued: The demise of Demerol,zbr2h1,"The opioid meperidine (Demerol) was widely prescribed in the United States (US) as an analgesic to treat moderate to severe pain. Meperidine was the most used opioid in the US in 1987 and was considered safer than other opioids during acute pancreatitis. Over the past two decades, meperidine has shifted from being frequently prescribed to being used only when patients are experiencing atypical reactions to opioids (e.g., morphine and hydromorphone); to removal from the World Health Organization's essential medication list and receiving strong warnings against its use from many professional organizations including the American Geriatrics Society. The unfortunate Libby Zion (1965-1984) case increased concerns about serotonin syndrome with meperidine. 

According to a prior pharmacoepidemiology report, the distribution of meperidine in the United States decreased by 95% between 2001 and 2019 \[1\]. The aim of this study was to include updated information (2020 and 2021) as well as examine the changes among Medicaid patients \[2\].

Although the distribution of meperidine has continued to greatly decrease throughout the US, we also identified substantial regional differences. There was a 34-fold state-level difference in meperidine distribution between Arkansas (16.8 mg/10 persons) and Connecticut (0.5 mg/10 persons) in 2020. Meperidine distribution in 2020 was significantly elevated in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama relative to the national average. In 2021, meperidine distribution was once again highest in Arkansas (16.7 mg/10 persons) and lowest in Connecticut (0.8 mg/10 persons). Similarly, the prescriptions of meperidine to Medicaid patients decreased by 74% between 2016 and 2021.

The main takeaway from this study is that there was a continued decrease in the overall distribution of meperidine in the past two decades, with a similar recent decline in prescribing to Medicaid patients. States in the south (Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) may be at risk for inappropriate prescribing. This data may reflect plans to phase out the use of this opioid, especially in the many situations where safer and more preferred opioids are available. As more prescribers in the US and abroad become aware of meperidine's inferiority to other opioids and its elevated risks for serotonin syndrome and neurotoxicity, this drug may soon become a relic of interest to only medical historians.

Recently a patient asked me for a benzo and gabapentin combo for 7 days so that they could treat acute alcohol withdrawal at home.

Of course we talked about the physical vs psychological treatment for addiction, that simply abstaining for as long as possible until relapse isn't the best course of action. I'm much more familiar and comfortable with RX'ing Naltrexone to curb cravings and when I ask someone to go to treatment there are always reasons why not (this week someone smoking meth three times daily said he couldn't leave his cat with his wife ...).

Kanye West is someone who has been open with having bipolar disorder to the severity that he has been previously hospitalised with it. He has also voiced his reluctance to take his medication- not because it doesnt work, but because of physical side effects so another manic episode was always going to be likely.

And this time round he seems to be going through one of his worse manic episodes ever. If you listen to him talk he is clearly having delusions of grandiosity and persecution, he barely forms coherent sentences, he has a fairly flat facial affect, his speech is pressured and jumps from topic to topic when speaking and he lacks any insight.

All in all, Kanye West is clearly ill. And what are people doing to him? Immediately boycotting and dropping him from companies costing him 100s of millions, parading him onto right-wing media outlets who have found he's too psychotic for even them, creating articles of the next nonsensical thing he says and overanaylsing the deeper meanings behind his anti-semetic ramblings.

I'm sure all of us who have worked in psychiatric settings have seen numerous patients present just like Kanye. Instead of attacking and mocking these people, we acknowledge they need help and do all that we can to ensure that we help them regardless of what they say.

509,Looking for Littmann stethoscope parts,zaa8ub,"I firmly believe that the older ""floating"" diaphragm style is superior to the newer tunable diaphragm.  Compromising and combining a bell and diaphragm was a bad idea.  A true bell works better as does a true diaphragm.  The tunables have a rim of soft plastic going around the outside and this changes the sound- especially the lower frequencies.  Can make sounds mushier and boomier- distorted; kind of like a speaker with the base turned up too high. The effect is subtle, but definitely audible.  Sounds on the floating diaphram are sharper and crisper.  It truly baffles me as to why Littmann/3M abandonded the older technology.

I have a Cardiology II which is the older style, ""Floating.""  The rim broke and I cannot find a replacement anywhere.  3M no longer supports these or sells parts for them.  The Classic II and the Cardiology III use the same rim and it can be used, but 3M has changed the design and now the diaphragm and rim are all one unit.  

The Cardiology II is one of my favorite scopes of all time and I cannot use it.  I am trying to find a replacement and have looked on Amazon, Ebay, and companies that sell replacement parts like Allheart and Steeles; but they are all selling the newer style.  I think I am just OOL, but does any have an idea where I can possibly source a replacement?

511,VENT: new patients complaining about wait times,za3v7j,"Primary care med/peds here.  Like all the rest of you, I'm overbooked, burned out, spend my nights and weekends charting, and feel constantly guilty that I can't get more of my patients in when they are sick or have urgent needs.   

I currently have 2-3 new patient spots on my template daily.  I'm working on getting it down to 1 general new patient and 1 pediatric-specific new patient spot per day (hoping to increase my % of peds patients while keeping my panel size stable). My current wait time for an adult new patient appointment is about 3-4 months.  My area is growing rapidly; we've had a massive influx of people moving here over the past 5 years and it doesn't appear to be slowing down anytime soon.  

Lately this has been happening more and more:  I walk in to see a new patient, reach out to shake my hand and introduce themselves, and they OPEN THE VISIT with a grumpy complaint about how they ""waited soooooo long to get this appointment"" or ""you must be busy because it took us 4 months to schedule this!""  I'd estimate between 30 and 50% of the time this is the first thing the patient will say to me.  I have a very good poker face and have a great relationship with my patients, but on the inside these conversations make me irrationally angry.   I'm starting out the visit on the defensive, by  apologizing for something that is not my fault, and frankly I don't even care that much about.  I'm trying to avoid growing my panel size.  How am I expected to be responsible for the entire population that is moving to town?  Do I have some unspoken obligation to everyone in town, who I've never met and have no relationship with, that I should drop everything and see them as a new patient within a week anytime they ask?  I know that most people don't understand much about how the health system works, but it just seems like common sense that a doctor can't just see unlimited numbers of patients. 

Also, I know for a fact that most of my colleagues in the area have even longer wait times than I do.  So presumably in many cases these people picked me because they contacted the large organization I work for, asking for a PCP appointment, and they were referred to me as the doctor with the first available appointment spot.  (Shouldn't they be thanking me then?)

I generally respond with some version of, ""I know wait times can be long for a new patient appointment, but we limit the number of new patient spots per day so that we are available for our existing patients."" That usually diffuses the tension.  I'm just salty that I'm immediately put on the defensive in so many of these interactions.  

Not really looking for a solution here because I know inherently these people are just frustrated and venting (like I'm venting here) but fielding these complaints from new patients has weirdly been one of the most annoying parts of my job lately and figured some of you could probably relate.

I work fulltime in the community hospital setting where we do have on call cards/cath capability so this hasn’t come up / been an issue.  However I just started working per diem at a critical access hospital in bumblefuck with no resources.  I had a case the other day that really made me question if I was the crazy one or if it was the receiving hospitalist.

Had an elderly female with extensive PMhx (cad with stent, pulm htn, lupus, ischemic cardiomyopathy, dm2 , htn, hld, obese, etc) present with new onset exertional chest pressure.  No CP at rest but she is able to reliably reproduce it by walking a few feet.  Described as pressure, substernal, no vomiting or diaphoresis but she feels nauseated when it comes on.  Goes away with a few min rest.  She was able to reproduce it in our ED while walking to the bathroom.  Prior to today she did not have any chest pain with exertion.

Last cath was 2.5 years ago.  Last tte one year ago. Last stress one year ago, unknown results.  

EKG without changes.  Trop x2 negative (normal trop not hs). My hospital doesn’t have cardiology (we have to thrombolyse most of our stemi cases) .  Based on risk factors and classic story for unstable angina I gave asa and heparinized the patient. I attempted to transfer to higher level of care (hospital with cards/cath lab).  

 The hospitalist was nearly yelling at me over the phone stating he was going to discharge the patient shortly after arrival as “ekg was normal and trops were normal” and that it would be a huge waste of everyone’s time.  He said cardiology would never cath something like this.  

Is the standard of care in these cases (textbook/classic unstable angina) not cardiac cath or at least heparin until cardiology eval?

I'm only a nurse and I find that even for me I find myself forgetting much of the minutiae that we learned in the basic sciences/ nursing school; especially that which does not pertain to the area of nursing I'm in. I'm a psych nurse so obviously I'm good with pharmacology as well as neuroscience to an extent, however I forget much of the other information such as all the different markings on each bone, the insertion points of all the muscles, each step of the Krebs cycle, how to identify cells under a microscope, immunology and the function of each component, etc.

But for me as a nurse, I am not diagnosing or having to come up with differentials so not remembering all of those details doesn't really have much of an impact. As a physician however, not only do you learn information about 10,000 times in depth than nurses do, but you need all of it in order to diagnose, formulate differentials and to spot and treat the zebras (rare/ complex conditions).

518,ctDNA testing,z95bt8,"Anyone able to weigh in on the utility of this? I have a patient who is s/p surgery, chemo, radiation, and currently on hormone therapy  - their oncologist offered ""Guardant Reveal"" for breast cancer surveillance. ([https://guardantreveal.com/](https://guardantreveal.com/).)  Patient is concerned about cost of the testing, I wan't at all ready to talk to them about pros and cons.

This paper from Annals of Oncology ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33232761/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33232761/)) seems to be on board for this type of testing, but I would love to learn more. Thanks!",pancake____,20,12,0.87
519,Perception of Physical Therapy/Physical Therapists?,z8yxuy,"A topic heavily discussed in PT school and PT clinics is the underutilization of physical therapy. I have heard that surgeons have had bad experiences w/ reinjury d/t physical therapists, but, in my experience, these instances seem to be relatively rare, especially in the OP setting.

520,NYC to expand involuntary psych admissions,z8rnmu,"I didn't see this posted here yet and I'm interested in everyone's opinion. I'm not a doctor but I'm an RN working in psych. Besides the logistical nightmare it creates, I think this legislation has some major ethics issues. I linked the NYT article but the link below is the a pdf of the actual legislative agenda.

521,What warning signs/symptoms do you wish were more well known?,z8mknl,"Last week one of our admin staff presented to the ED after experiencing jaw/neck pain that proceeded to chest pain. She ended up arresting in front of the triage desk but was successfully brought back by CPR and is now recovering from surgery to place stents.I genuinely didn't know that jaw/neck pain is a common warning sign for heart attack in women.

What do you think/wish was more commonly known about by both the medical and or/public audiences?

523,"Legality of Ketamine and what I think are online ""pill mills""",z8bfyd,"This has been a new thing I have seen advertised on facebook/instagram.  A company whose tagline is ""Experience a safe and fast-acting antidepressant in the comfort of your own home"".  Pictured is a woman in a yoga outfit sipping coffee and gazing out the window.   They also send you some kit with what appears to be a blindfold and a journal.  The process to sign up is very convoluted and website hides what actually is being provided until you speak to multiple consultants.  Apparently they offer to send you doses of ketamine to your house, have a few online therapy sessions and use a random family friend as a ""sitter"".

I was under the impression that legitimate ketamine clinics were tightly regulated and had to be administered in person, and only for patients with documented treatment resistant depression who have failed multiple medications.   How can this company be legal?  Maybe I am just out of the loop, but this smells to be an awful lot like online ADHD pill mills.

Thoughts?

More details: They will send you 6 doses of Ketamine for $1,399 and 18 for $2,999.  I'm not saying there is not a lot of promise to ketamine treating depression, but it just seems fishy the way it's being done.",Chicagogally,129,116,0.93
