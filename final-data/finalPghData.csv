5,Missing: Lost Wallet in South Side,11vxjcx,"As the title says, I was in a hurry to get home last night from 8:30pm-9:00pm and lost my wallet somewhere between 18th street (was at Bird On The Run) and 24th Street. 

It contained my ID, health cards, credit cards, membership cards, and $70 cash - as well as some mostly used gift cards. 

Short after I lost it, 5 fraudulent charges appeared on my Citi account also: 2 at Glass Zone and 3 at Carson News & Lottery (all betweeen 11:00pm-11:45pm.)

I've filed a police report, per advice from my bank and the local police station - but figured I'd post here just in-case someone happens to come across it. (I'm honestly assuming it was tossed in the garbage or could still be in the possession of whoever had been using my Citi card.

12,"Seeking emergency housing for single LGBTQ person, plus one cat.",11uwmkq,"I understand that this is a real tough ask but I have found myself backed into an unimaginable corner today. I moved back to the area a couple of months ago to stay with family after the dissolution of a relationship. It’s a long story, but I came out to them today and am now facing homelessness with my cat as a consequence of that decision if I can’t figure something out immediately.

If we were out of winter I would just find a nice tree somewhere and make it work but I have health issues that make it difficult for me to maintain my body temp, so I could die in the cold. Also obviously worried about my cat, who I could never subject to that kind of life, but I also don’t know where is safe for the both of us. 
I’m going to bullet point some stuff to try to summarize more succinctly. 

• I’m 28, nonbinary, and currently in Verona

• I am autistic and physically disabled

• I am employed but do not make enough at current job, and haven’t had luck with interviews yet 

• I have about $500 in the bank currently 

• I do not have any other family to stay with, and I do not have any friends or other human support system at the moment. 

I reached out to a couple of coworkers in the hopes that I might get a header on someone that needs a roommate, but haven’t heard back from anyone. 

I know there is a shelter in the Alle-Kiski area that accepts pets at an adjacent kennel as well, but I am not sure if I will have the resources together to actually have a home by the time a short-term shelter stay expires. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m really scared. Please reserve any judgement if you don’t vibe with this post, but please, if you have any sound advice or tips or anything at all that could help, i would be so grateful. Thank you for reading.

Edit: wanted to mention I also applied for housing via the city’s housing authority a while back out of caution, and I am on a waitlist for three places, but it’s going to be a while I think. #75 for two apartments and #52 for the other; I read it could take up to a year or more and I might not be high priority as an individual.",corpora_sanguis,41,39,0.62
13,Questions About Tree Removal and Property Lines,11vm9dp,"I'm a relatively new homeowner. There's 2 large trees in my backyard, both are right along what I think is my property line. The first tree is dying, choked by vines and is hanging dangerously over one of my neighbors house so it's got to go. The second tree is alive and well, but hasn't not been maintained and has some larger branches over my roof so it needs trimmed at a minimum. 

First question - what's the best way to determine if the trees are on my property line? I'm 95% sure the first tree is on my property, but I'm 50/50 on the second tree.

Second question - if the tree that needs trimmed isn't mine, who's responsibility is it to maintain it? Mine (because the branches are over my yard) or my neighbor's (because the tree is on their property)?

Third question - any recommendations for tree removal/tree trimming services? I'm located in the south hills.",Flip3408,15,1,0.57

31,Greetings from 2 midwesterners living in Austin looking at Pittsburgh as a potential home,11ven36,"Hello Pittsburgh Reddit fam- I have always been very fond of your city and people from the standpoint of a touring musician who has burst out of the Fort Pitt tunnel and performed there on various occasions. (even had a drummer who lived there). 

Back story: I grew up in St. Louis, have lived in Chicago,Mpls,KC,LA,Florida,Colorado and Austin for the last 17 years. I have ton of family over on the East Coast. My fiancé who has never been to PGH, is a tattoo artist whose emphasis is “black and grey” art. She’s Polish, & from Detroit & has lived in Austin for the last 6 years.  Understandably she misses the 4 seasons and a closer proximity to family in MI. She loves forests with tall trees and skies loaded with gloom,& gorgeous autumns, which ain’t Austin). I dig hilly-mountainous topography as opposed to flat farmland. 

Having lived almost 2 decades through the dramatic changes in Austin, I am ready for a new adventure and hopefully a forever home for us. In the event of a move, we will miss friends & the simpler times when Austin was less crowded and more affordable with less lines to do pretty much anything. Those long hot summers tho😳! We don’t seek life in a massive metropolis.  ATX & PGH are somewhat similar in size. While the cities do tend to share some other similarities,I understand there exists immense differences that hopefully you can help us delineate .

In our quest to discover more, we are coming up to visit PGH in mid June. We have a few friends there and hope make many more!  We want to explore the arts, gothic architecture, food, unique neighborhoods, bars, parks/outdoors, and music scene there from Heavy metal-punk-jazz-avant-garde. (Yes we both love heavy rock music so any ties into those communities are encouraged) 

Any advice for us?
How do you see Pittsburgh growing and progressing? 
Healthy music/arts from your POV?
What ideas could people bring into PGH that would improve the city?
What would you want to see more of? Less of?
Up and coming neighborhoods to check out?

Again,PGH from a geographical standpoint puts us right in the middle of family and far more cities than down here in TX.

What if indeed there were two rivaling industrial cities in Allegheny county of equal population and economic interests. When pittsburgh annexed allegheny city in 1907 the population rose from 321,616 to 533,905. It's safe to say that if the city remained independent the populations would be somewhat similar, albeit pittsburgh having larger influxes.

The stories are typically supernatural in theme but are centered around subjects like county fairs and family beach vacations to Myrtle Beach. Think of it as an Appalachian Twilight Zone. 

Also, there’s a whole story in there about my dislike for Cincinnati Chili. We may not support the same squads but I’m sure this is a safe space for that opinion. In fact, the protagonists of that particular story are Pirates fans.

51,What do you like about Pittsburgh compared to other major US cities you have lived in or visited?,11ti4fv,"Hi all,
So me and my S.O (mid 20’s) are kind of at a crossroads of what we want to do. We are both originally from the area, moved away for college, and moved to the city proper for our careers. Our careers let us be transient so we have been deciding to stay in Pittsburgh (Our family is also all close here), Move to DC, Move to LA, or move to NYC (we would have col adjust). So I was wondering - For those who lived in other cities, What do you like about Pittsburgh compared to the others?

My pros:

-The people, Every city I have visited I feel like Pittsburgh has the best people. I don’t know if it’s the blue collar-esque history, But even out of town people who moved here everyone I have met has been great, and have made friends really easily here. I like how in Pittsburgh you can have a random conservation with anyone, And it’s natural like you’ve known them, Also the lack of stand-offness. I think this also shows in our Reddit, Compared to other cities reddit’s I’ve asked questions in. It’s like the opposite of the “Seattle Freeze” 

-The neighborhood aspect, I know this isn’t exactly unique, But I specifically love our neighborhoods and how each one could almost be a town. 

-The culture, I just love it, I grew up with it, and it’s something I brag about to my friends in other cities.

-Cost of buying a house, Especially compared to the others on the list.

Cons:

-Stuff closes early compared to other cities, This is a huge thing as I’m a night owl, When I visited a friend NYC I realized just how stark it is. Though I love certain parts of our nightlife, It all closes early. 

-The pollution, Though I do think Pittsburgh has a great trajectory, With such a tech and healthcare focus and constant tracking and talk about our pollution, You don’t see this as much in cities with worse pollution. (I had no idea how bad LA was) 

-Sameness, It would just be staying with the familiar, Though maybe tons of traveling could make up for this.

-Lack of options, Though I love the restaurants I frequent, It isn’t say - NYC in terms of food choices/Things to do.",TheMiddlePoli,141,28,0.71

118,10 story 117 apartment building in Shadyside approved by Zoning Board last night,11r5ci8,"This was posted about back in December when a NIMBY Shadyside landlord attached handouts to people's cars: https://old.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/zg5y29/nimbyism_in_shadyside/ 

Story from the Pure Garbage:

> #Size matters: Scaled-back Shadyside apartment project wins city zoning board approval

>A developer’s gamble to reduce the size of a controversial Shadyside apartment project to win city approval has paid off.

>The Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment approved several variances and a special exception Monday that will enable Mozart Management and Camp Eight Capital to move forward with the 10-story complex at 525 S. Aiken Ave.

>In its 11-page decision, the zoning board concluded that approving the requests was “appropriate” given the evidence and testimony presented at a November hearing, and the community commitments and parking mitigation measures proposed by the development team.

>The ruling represents a bit of redemption for Mozart and Camp Eight after the same board last August shot down their proposal to build a 12-story, 131-unit apartment building at the site.

>In response, the developers revamped their plan, cutting the number of floors from 12 to 10, reducing the proposed height from 132 feet to 108 feet, and dropping the number of apartments to 117.

>However, the revised proposal did nothing to appease some Shadyside residents who live near the site and who raised concerns about the impact on traffic, parking and the overall character of the neighborhood.

>But the zoning board, in its ruling, found that the requested variances related to height and unit size “will not adversely affect the essential character of the neighborhood or the public welfare.”

>It also determined that the developers had presented “credible and unrefuted evidence that the increased density represented by the proposed development will not result in adverse traffic impacts and sufficient parking will be available on-site.”

>As part of their revised plan, Mozart and Camp Eight cut the number of vehicle spaces from 101 to 82 and eliminated one level of underground parking.

>Fifty of the 82 spaces will be available at the complex and another 32 in the parking lot for the adjacent Arlington Apartments owned by Mozart.

>In a statement released Monday, Zsolt Bessko, Mozart managing director, and David Gefsky, Camp Eight founder, called the board’s ruling “the successful culmination of a 20-month community-driven process to achieve the optimal design for a site at the vibrant S. Aiken and Centre Avenue corridor.”

>“The building’s design, operations, and context in relation to the surrounding area were improved with community input as part of this process,” they stated.

>The developers also maintained that the project will be one of the first mixed-market multifamily buildings in Shadyside to voluntarily designate 10% of its units as affordable to households making less than 80% of the area median income.

>“To create vibrant neighborhoods and cities, we need more density — done responsibly, appropriately, and sensitively,” the developers said. “Creating high-quality housing options for renters across the socio-economic spectrum in Shadyside is a step in the right direction.”

>In its ruling, the zoning board stated that it “appreciates the applicant’s efforts to address the lack of affordable housing in the city through increased density and their intent to provide affordable units in the proposed development.”

>Janine McVay, a Shadyside resident who opposed the development, declined comment Monday, saying the ruling was still being reviewed.

>As part of its ruling, the board also concluded that the revised design was “consistent with the adjacent building and other multi-story, multi-unit residential buildings in the immediate vicinity.”

>“The board notes that the applicant originally requested more significant variances with respect to height and density and, in response to community concerns and this board’s recommendation, reduced the scope of its requests,” it said.

>It further ruled that the development “would be the minimum that would allow for the economically feasible development of the site.”

>During the November hearing, Mr. Gefsky testified that without zoning relief the total number of apartments that could be built at the site would be 28 — at a cost of $489,004 a unit.

>At 117 apartments, the cost for each, he said, would be $356,017 — meaning rents would be 37.4% less than they would if a developer was limited to 28 units.

>The approval did come with conditions, including the pledge designating 10% of the units as affordable to those at 80% of the area median income.

>It also incorporated community benefits promised by the development team. They included design features to mitigate impacts of the building’s size and operations on nearby residential properties and streetscape and landscaping improvements along South Aiken and Claybourne Street.

Then the weather changed and all the tenants started using their heat. The furnace in the unit above me produces a loud dripping sound basically 24/7 in my bedroom which is also my office (I WFH). Loud enough that earplugs don't work at all. It is genuinely difficult to fall asleep. Additionally, right where the dripping sound comes from there was a suspicious black spot on the ceiling. I cleaned it shortly after moving in but after a month of the dripping noise I did a mold culture and it grew mold. I've been going back and forth with the landlord's office since October and they went from saying there's nothing wrong but you can move out, to it's actually condensation from the exhaust and they'll try adding insulation to the pipe, and now back to they can't do anything. Is there an agency I can contact? It feels like they aren't taking it seriously. I can't imagine it being good for there to be something leaking in the ceiling like this, plus the mold. I don't really want to move and even if I do, the next tenant is going to hear this and complain. It's not like this place is a dump either. I've lived in worse apartments and have never had an issue like this.

153,"Planning to move family to Pittsburgh, what neighborhood/suburb fits our needs",11r8fg4,"Hi all, I searched and found a lot of threads similar to this that were aimed for a younger audience, I hope this is different enough to warrant its own thread.

Long story short, we've visited Pittsburgh in the past and just spent this last weekend there getting a feel for different areas.  We're due to have twins in September and are planning to make an offer in the next month or sooner.  We're both 35, stable in our careers with full WFH capabilities.  We chose pittsburgh because we've always liked it and it is equidistant from families..best of all worlds.

So we're asking the hive mind what neighborhoods or suburbs say within 30 minutes meet what we're looking for, in priority order:

1. Bigger (2800 sq ft+), single family detached houses with sizeable yards for a budget between 500-700K.  Newer or older construction isn't as important as size and yard.
2. Neighborhood/community safety -- it's important that we feel safe taking a walk, especially my wife who is on the smaller side and will be pushing a stroller soon enough
3. Very good or great public schools, or in the area of outstanding private schools.

Things we'd really like but aren't deal breakers.

* A walkable central business district with restaurants/shops, even if we have to drive to it.
* Sidewalks or parks with walking trails, even if it's a short drive away.
* Relative proximity to I79 or the Turnpike as we expect to have a lot of elderly family visiting from those highways. (we have friends in the Highland Park neighborhood which we like, but can't imagine either of our parents navigating to there)
* It's wishful thinking to predict the future but we'd like a neighborhood that is going to still be a good place to live in \~20 years or so as we plan on making this our home.    

We both drive so public transportation isn't necessary but wouldn't hurt.

She said something felt off about it so she kept an eye on the guy in the SUV and after too many similar turns, she pulled into a parking lot on Murray near Shady that has a security guard. 

The SUV went past the parking lot at first, but a few minutes later, the same SUV pulled into the parking lot and started driving slowly through the lot.

They are serving dinners- I am not clear if they will be monthly or more weekly, but it is very particular atm- one seating- 6:00 PM on Thurs, Fri, Sat. One set chef's menu- 5 course. It says it will be communal seating and parties of 2, 4, or 6. So I am super curious what this whole experience is going to be like. \*Pay ahead\* and the pricing is far and above any restaurant in the vicinity. I would say the price is at least double the most expensive restaurant in the county. You'd have to drive into the city for something to match it- hopefully the food is worth it. I am hoping they will pull a crowd from the city, because while there are a lot of great vegan options there, there isn't really a gourmet vegan place and a lot of the upscale restaurants don't have many, if any vegan options (give me recommendations if you have any favorites!). 

I have a reservation for next week, which is the first weekend. I will report back.

In the summer, they'll be doing more casual lunches and soft serve as well. 

The place is really lovely and the owners are fabulous, so anyone looking for a nice vegan weekend getaway, I recommend!

They did a take-out vegan Valetine's dinner and that was amazing. A cheesecake that was really mind-blowing and pistachio baklava. They are also very allergen friendly.

I'm also wondering what people do for storage (both during the summer and for the off season). Do you put your cushions away to protect them from squirrels? Do you leave them on but cover the furniture? Do you leave the furniture out over the winter or store it inside?",whethersweater,14,3,0.62

Haven’t driven it in a while because it needs a lot of work. I recently started the process of getting it fixed and found out that it’s gonna cost 6 or 7 thousand more than I thought. One guy told me I’d be looking at around 3 or 4k for the repairs. Another guy took a closer look at everything and said it’ll be around 10k which is more than the car is worth. It needs a massive engine overhaul including a new ignition coil(s), cylinder work, new spark plugs and possibly the motor among other things. Also the brake system needs looked at because even though it has new pads, rotors and plenty of fluid, the pedal goes all the way to the floor (this wasn’t happening at all when I initially stopped driving it) and they don’t know if it’s a booster issue or the entire ABS system.

I've loved Portland for its food scene (never-ending choices of independent restaurants of all cuisines), walkability and unique neighborhoods (I love how many neighborhoods feel like urban forests with plenty of trees and unique native plant gardens, etc), abundance of cool coffee shops, proximity to beautiful city parks and nature (parks where you can feel lost in the woods, close-by waterfalls), and how it feels like there is always something to do. I'll be living near Centre Ave in between Shadyside and East Liberty.

I know PGH may not have all of those in spades, but I'm originally born and raised in St. Louis, and I have a real love for underdog cities like PGH and STL, where locals know and appreciate what might not be obvious from the outside looking in.

365,Any other folks with experience moving to South Hills from out of state?,11j1qx2,"We are currently selling our home in CA and moving to Pittsburgh. We have researched the different areas along with working with a local realtor on trying to narrow down a location. I believe we will land in the South Hills. I actually like a lot of homes in the North Hills, but conveniences of the South. 

Cons I have seen with Mt. Lebanon are small one car garages and I believe no street parking (we will have two cars). Smaller yards, houses closer together. I have heard it is noisy with constant lawn mowers or snow blowers, but that could have been one person's experience. Having a community feel would be awesome. No busses. Not a huge deal, but it is a factor. My son wants to ride a school bus. 

Pros-walkable, great schools, great parks, T line. I am not finding houses that I love, but work ok. Nothing in my preferred style. 

My husband is leaning toward USC. Biggers yards, some two car garage, great schools and parks. I tend to like homes for sale here more than Mt. Lebanon. 

Con-no sidewalks, seems more right leaning (not a big deal if folks are civil). I read the township is strict on what you can do with your lot (fencing etc) and I hoped to add a 120 sq ft work from home space in the back like we did here. I assume people still walk the neighborhoods sans sidewalks and play outside? Less of a community feel (I have read). 

Has anyone else moved to the area from out of state that can fill me in on living in South Hills? I worry that the transition might be rough seeing that we don't have family in the area and are outsiders. I have two kids ages 4 and 7. My 7 year old can be quite anxious and introverted in new social situations. 

I can't say we have found a community anywhere we have lived in CA either. I am originally from two hours away in Ohio and my husband was born outside of Pittsburgh, but hasn't lived in the area for many years. Sorry if this seems rambling. Selling and buying and preparing to relocate a family of 4 with two cats across country has nearly fried my brain.

We stayed at the Marriot on Penn.. We walked down under a hwy toward this street that had all these shops.. it was a Saturday night. One way street. About a mile or two from hotel..

On the way we walked down Liberty I believe and on the one side of the street was this building that seemed like went forever.. Old bus station? Still in use? (Didn't look like it).. At the end I think we came across Greyhound so thats why we assumed bus station.. Can anyone tell me more about this place? What happened...

376,Looking for an outdoor range that allows steel targets and has a decent guest policy.,11ih7kb,"Moved recently from Baltimore and I'm surprised to find that there was better shooting back there than there seems to be here. Large outdoor compounds with plenty of lanes, rarely run by Fudds, relatively relaxed steel target rules, and no real restrictions on bringing guests (provided you pay a small fee everytime). So far I haven't found anything like that here.

I was originally looking at Pitcairn Monroeville Sportsmen's Club until I realized you can only ever bring the same guest 3 times EVER. Then I was checking out Clairton Sportsmen's Club but they seem to have pretty extreme steel target rules (and possibly not so great guest rules too). There's a public range just north of the city but no steel shooting whatsoever (respect though how affordable it is so can't complain). There were two clubs that seemed to allow steel shooting, Dormont-Mt. Lebanon Sportsmen's Club and Collier Sportsmen's Association, but both are closed to new members. 

I plan on calling Washington County Guns, Lawrence County Sportsman Association, and Rochester Sportsmen's Club next unless anyone here already knows how those places are. Also open to any recommendations. Would love to be shooting again somewhere when the sun comes back out (especially where I can shoot steel and bring friends).

Fifth, Forbes, Penn and Liberty are all streets that could make sense for a light rail line. I know the busway exists, but it is not as convenient and acts more like a commuter route to bypass many blocks of the city as opposed to a rail line that has a dedicated right of way and stops frequently to connect to many neighborhoods.

Essentially there's no reliable search function. The app goes back and forth between allowing free access and the forwarding of stories to suddenly throwing up a paywall on some days. I recently got a digital subscription for an introductory dirt cheap rate, so now they send me a daily digest which I can't access.

Then there's the Giant Eagle. I've shopped at Waterworks for about 6-7 years, and before that at Shadyside Market District. Now when I go to the website it suddenly tells me my designated favorite store is Squirrel Hill which I haven't been in for at least 12 years. I wouldn't care except that I always order online and Squirrel Hill doesn't do delivery. I clicked on ""only show Curbside stores"" and manually selected Waterworks, but every time I've gone to the site for the last 2 months, I have to repeat the process to get rid of Squirrel Hill, which is also a few miles further from me than Waterworks, so there's no reason why it would be picked for me.

And Next Door! Don't get me started on the incredibly idiotic comments on there, but the website itself is certainly the worst that I've encountered. A few months ago they started the option to ""make it a post"" when you comment on someone's post.

440,Help me design my urban hike through Pittsburgh,11esixo,"Sometime soon, I plan to take a leisurely urban hike from one end of Pittsburgh to another. 

I am excited about this hike, but the problem is that I haven't lived in Pittsburgh since 1985, and don't know the lay of the land anymore. I hope to use this experience to reacquaint myself with the city that I loved dearly before I got swept up in the Pittsburgh diaspora--mainly as initial research for a project that I haven't completely thought through yet, but I suspect will end up being a kind of love letter to the city. 

I just looked at the map and quickly tried to plot a route. I did this quickly, but he idea is to start at the edge of McKees Rocks, hike up and around to Mt. Washington, taking the incline and then probably the Smithfield Bridge across into downtown--and then out through the Strip, wending my way through both Schenley and Frick Parks and ending up in Regent Square. I plan on taking two days, and hope to talk to some colorful Yinzers along the way.

I know there is one place in Nashville that can do it, but before I commit to that, I was wondering if anyone local could do it. After the console is resurrected, there are a few other things that could use some love, but that's the most urgent.

I obsessively save copies of everything, so I went back and looked at the application we filled out in the hospital for the record and the father's name is spelled out as clear as day... that means someone at Magee likely didn't put that into the computer and send it off to Harrisburg like they should have.

Having the birth record and certificate amended to add a parent is a huge pain the the butt and quite the expense if proof documents of the parents are required to be ordered from other states.

I went to a GetGo for gas. I used my Perks and used a gift card. I didn't save the extra 30 cents with Advantage Pay because I didn't actually use the card to pay for anything. 🙄

Maybe someone has experienced this, but if I would have put, say, $1 over top of my transaction, would I have saved the 30 cents for the whole transaction or would the pump really only discount that $1?  It's only $2.40 that I lost, but that's still $2.40.

527,Maximizing Kennywood Fun!,11bapx6,"Here's my plan on getting the most out of a single Kennywood season pass with my 20 month old - thought it might be interesting for other folks in similar boats.

Same fall/next year (eg 2022/2023) season passes go on sale in late August. KW and Sandcastle (SC) has free admission for kids 3 and under, Idlewild (IW) for 2 and under. The platinum pass gets you 2 free tickets to KW (not same day) and bring a friend pricing (around $20) on specific weekends for all parks. These perk weekends are, of which I don't think all of them will be bring a friend, are:


KW: Apr 22,23; May 27,28; Jun 24,25; Jul 22,23; Aug 26,27
SC: Jun 3,4; Jul 1,2; Aug 5,6; Sep 2,3
IW: Oct 22,23 during HallowBoo (maybe more)

Platinum also gets your parking and soda fountain drinks.

So after accumulating all this info across four websites and past emails, it makes sense for me to get a season pass this August given my kids birthday in July when he'll turn 2. I'll be able to bring my partner and 2 friends to HallowBoo this fall, being him to KW/SC up to every Sunday, save the free tickets for Fright Nights and take advantage of other discount pricing for other events, and hit up alternating bring a friend days when we want to go with others.

531,Freedom House Ambulance: The FIRST Responders,11aoxwc,"In 1967, Pittsburgh's inner city produced America’s first EMT service. Comprised solely of Black men and women recruited from the city’s Hill District neighborhood, the paramedics of Freedom House Ambulance became trailblazers in providing pre-hospital and CPR care. Freedom House was initially conceived to respond to the needs of Pittsburgh’s African American community who often times, couldn’t rely on police and fire departments during an emergency. Their ground breaking work became the basis for all paramedics training in the country. However, despite its success - racism and power dynamics in Pittsburgh shut down Freedom House in 1975, leaving its legacy almost lost to history.

This 30-minute documentary explores the rise and fall of Freedom House Ambulance. With rare archival images, the program features the story of inception from an original founder, compelling reflections of surviving paramedics, stories of the world-renowned doctors who trained them, and memories of lifelong Hill District residents.

From the Botanic Garden:

A few hours later, probably midnight or so, I was crossing the street at Becks Run and Carson to get on the bike path by the river and one of the FBI security guards came driving past, stopped, and out of his window said ""hey you look familiar, I hear you fuck with dips.  What's your phone number?""  I responded ""yeah, do you have any drugs?"" at which point he said ""man..."" and drove away.

Now, I'm pretty sure he meant 'guns' when he said 'dips', however my understanding is that 'a dip' is a gun (generally that you would need to bend over to reach, like in a car trunk or under the seat) while 'dips' is heroin/dope (because you keep nodding off after doing some).

95,Whom to Report Sales Tax Under-Collection To?,117d08f,"This is sort of a followup to a previous conversation on a thread here.

I'm going through my tax files, and hardly any companies I purchased online from last year collected 7% sales tax for Allegheny County. For small businesses that probably have 10 people on staff, I get it. But companies like Amazon need to be held accountable to stop them from systematically undercutting local businesses and shortchanging the county. To whom do I complain?

Part of the problem is that I'm not sure if it's officially fraud or more of just an unfair business practice that needs to be cracked down on. Also, I'm not 100% sure if it's a county or a State issue. I was going to default to the state AG's officer, but their Consumer Complaint form doesn't really seem cut out for this.

FYI, major companies that consistently charge ***my household*** 6% sales tax instead of 7% for online sales (I've heard some evidence that it varies person to person):

* Target
* eBay
* Amazon (except there were a couple transactions from 2020 where they randomly collected 7%)
* Best Buy (okay, I only bought one thing... so I can't prove a pattern)

Major Companies that DO seem to collect correctly:

* Steam
* Ikea

And of course reputable local retailers are charging the correct amount for their online sales. Stuff has to cost 0.94% more at White Whale Bookstore than on Target.com and Amazon.com, even if the sales price is the same.",leadfoot9,18,0,0.38

    You’re making my ears hurt and I completely understand if I’m supposed to hear this but just to know you I might be the one that is tuning you out and you don’t need me anymore 
    And you know me better than i know myself
    I make myself believe every little lie that you say to me and i’m only as easy as you want me to be and I’m still can’t let this go starting to lose interest and out of control
    It’s hard to say goodbye when you’re gone from the start
    I’ll be on the next flight down to Georgia
    You know that’s where I’ll be cause that’s what’s always on my mind - call me if you need me to come back home to send a postcard marked from the atlantic coast

98,What do you love about your neighborhood?,117ah1z,"Hi everybody, it's your favorite Anti-Litter Specialist from the City of Pittsburgh. You may remember me from such threads as [*""We're going to install Ballot Bin cigarette butt receptacles throughout the city,""*](https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/v6ujw4/were_going_to_install_these_ballot_bin_cigarette/) and [*""Let's talk trash, Pittsburgh!""*](https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/ph4riu/lets_talk_trash_pittsburgh_litter_illegal_dumping/)

*Quick question for you* \- **What do you love about your neighborhood?**

*Long, unnecessary backstory for you* \- Last year Mayor Gainey's office asked for an anti-litter campaign, and we pitched it to the full cabinet last week. Our presentation acknowledged that most of these type of campaigns tend to fail or even make the problem worse. So instead of us going out and yelling at people calling them awful little litterbugs creating an adversarial relationship between local government and residents, let's do something entirely different: 1) acknowledge the problems with urban blight that people are living through, 2) take responsibility for the problem, 3) and show how *we* are changing to have better outcomes for residents. Simply put, we change how we operate on all things related to urban blight, we fix problems like we are supposed to, and we simply share that with people as that's what people get excited about. 

The Mayor's office was very receptive the strategy, but Mayor Gainey had a very good question for us: *""Where's the love?""* He noted that internally, as City employees, we are overly fixated on problems because that's literally our jobs, so oftentimes our messaging can be overly dour. We want to brighten up our messaging by tying the work of remediating urban blight like litter to the idea of protecting and promoting everything you love about where you live. To do that, I want to go right to the people and learn what that is.

To my surprise, a ""weather adjustment charge"" pops up at the bottom, bumping my bill up a whole 7% more than what it should have been. After I look into it, sure enough, [its a charge for warm weather](https://www.wnep.com/article/news/verify/whats-with-the-wna-ugi-weather-normalization-adjustment-national-weather-service-gas-bills-verify/523-47687b0a-c512-4af7-b874-6aee56ac3123). 

How is this ok? I understand its supposed to be a charge/credit system to keep things balanced for warmer and colder weather, but there's no guarantee that it equals out. Especially with climate change, milder winters will likely be more normal, so this seems like a way to pad their pockets while they on average lose usage. Or am I just balancing on the cynical edge of conspiracy insanity?

I just don't understand. It's like going to a restaurant and only getting an appetizer because you weren't that hungry, and then getting charged for an entree because you didn't spend enough. 

And before anyone chimes in with the budget plan, thank you, I know, but thankfully I can afford my gas bill. This just seems dumb at best, or corrupt at worst. So I'm curious how it even became a thing.",dingurth1,44,76,0.89

I went to elementary school in the Pittsburgh Public Schools in the early 2000s so this would have been between 2000 and 2006.

There would be days when people would come to the school with some kind of activity or presentation. Some that I remember was a recycling guy that I think did a magic show where ""Reduce, Reuse, Recycle"" were the magic words, a woman who taught about germs and would have us wash our hands and then see how clean our hands were by showing the germs under a microscope, and people coming from Carnegie Library to read us a story.

But the one that stands out to me most was the person that would come with this giant plush dummy to teach us about the body. This thing was at least 4ft long/tall, probably more like 5ft. It was very similar to those giant teddy bears. Pretty sure it had blue yarn like hair. It's stomach velcro-ed open and there were a bunch of stuffed body parts. I clearly remember learning about the small and large intestines because they'd pull out the intestine and it would wrap around the room.

I've been with AHN throughout my pregnancy, specifically with Century Medical Associates in Robinson. I most likely will be having a c-section, so I'm super interested on anyone's c-section experiences recently and which hospital you had yours at, but I'd love to hear any and all labor and delivery experiences at the AHN hospitals! 

Due to a most likely elective c-section, I have the choice of West Penn (where my OBGYN Dr. Vasquez practices at) or the new Wexford Hospital (but I have not met any of their OBGYNs). 

Any advice or experiences? I had my growth scan at Wexford and it's a really beautiful hospital. However Dr. Vasquez has amazing manners and I feel comfortable with him.

Over the past two years, we've been trying different types of medications to try and have a positive effect, and it's something we're still working on.  

Their symptoms manifest in a number of ways:  Unable to get out of bed in the morning, anhedonia, negative thoughts, anxiety attacks, and others.  Things have improved a bit with therapy and medication, but we're still a ways off from being stable.  When these symptoms began to really heavily affect their life, we made the decision that they would become the ""stay-at-home spouse"" and look after things while I was the ""breadwinner"".  That's worked out fine, but they have begun to wonder if they are eligible for disability benefits from the SSA.  Their symptoms would make it very difficult to hold a job, if not impossible.

I've done a little research online, and honestly it's all very confusing and I still don't know the answer to that question.  We're thinking it might be best if we speak to a professional about this - i.e. a lawyer who specializes in this kind of thing.  If possible, I'd like to get some recommendations from real people, since it can be rather intimidating to navigate this space with all the commercials, billboards, and the negative opinions that some people have about mental illnesses.

About a week later, I get a hefty bill of $300 from the property company. 
Each Sink $25, Oven $100, Fridge $30 etc etc . It was just a breakdown of charges and not an invoice from a cleaning company. I  understand a bill of $150, but not $300.

Reading the Yelp reviews, it sounds like the Mozart gestapo comes banging on the door at least every month and one needs to have passed the bar in order to sift through the lease. There's nothing under a year old though, so is it possible they have changed.

I'd totally give them a pass except I'm moving from out of state which makes this a little harder. My girlfriend needs an elevator (or at least a first floor apartment) and we have two cats. 

We're looking Squirrel Hill/Shadyside/Bloomfield/Friendship area.  Mozart's places fulfill all our requirements and they seem nice but I'm afraid of being that character in the horror movie who stumbles into the haunted house despite all the warning signs.

I was watching other couples who were all dressed up walk in and the disappointment hit their face. The wait staff looked lost and we’re just kind of in the way.

294,Transplants: What Made You Decide to Leave Pittsburgh After Moving Here?,110vkgj,"This question is for a specific set of people. For those of you who moved to Pittsburgh from out of state, what made you decide to leave? I guess the question is also relevant for anyone who has decided to leave Pittsburgh.

I moved here 5 years ago and loved it for the first 2 years. I immediately met the man I thought I'd marry and was so happy here. A really rough breakup and Covid hitting launched a depression that I haven't kicked. Yes, I'm in therapy and on meds. I tried many things to connect to the city more and tried to make friends but it just was too hard. 

I feel like if something is that hard when it should be more simple, that's kind of a sign it's not right for you. If you ask your neighbor several times to get drinks and they say ""yes definitely"" and never follow up, I mean what more can you do?  If you ask your coworker to brunch and they say ""yes I'd love that"" but then ghost you, what more can you do? 

I don't think these are mean people. They're just busy and maybe depressed themselves. I don't think people have much energy these days and new friendships do require a lot of energy and equal effort.

I'm not looking for advice on making friends or anything like that. I've followed those tips and they didn't work and then depression hit harder and I don't have the energy to give to it anymore.

Disclaimer: I apologize, I'm not trying to spam, I'm just new to posting on reddit, more of a reader than poster.  
I posted yesterday in relation to the old Toynbee tiles, but I didn't realize using the link tab would apparently hide my text and photos (or wipe it out). That other post has lead to some hints of maybe a Toynbee tile still being in place, which is cool!

So, I'm going to try again this time without that link tab getting in the way.

For the past 6 months or so, I've been stumbling upon some new, fascinating, little art installations on the asphalt of some streets in downtown Pittsburgh.  One is near the intersection of Sixth & Smithfield near Mellon Square.

They're VERY reminiscent of the now nearly apocryphal Toynbee Tiles that were in several places around Pittsburgh (and the world!) during the last quarter of the last century.  In my earlier post, I mentioned that there is a decent Wikipedia entry on them and linked to a still functioning [site](https://toynbeeidea.com/) about them; which seems to be what scarped my text and photos.

These new pieces seem to be similar in media (colored linoleum tiles and asphalt glue) and they have some writing incorporated into the images. But so far it's pretty generic, or obscure text. 

Nothing mentioning any movies or books, nor any calls for resurrection on Jupiter or any other celestial body.  Still and all, i LOVE them and am very excited when I stumble on one.  Has anyone seen any more around? I'd love to see them if they exist.",StevInPitt,9,8,0.74

393,Recon Trip - Information & Opinions Wanted,10xi873,"I'll be visiting at the end of this month, to hopefully find a 1 bedroom cat friendly apartment with laundry for a (flexible) March move-in, in the East Liberty / Friendship / Shadyside area. Specifically, walking distance to Whole Foods, Trader Joe's etc. or a little further out for the right place.

I read a lot of related posts but some are pretty old, so I wanted to ask for recent experiences. Thanks so much for anything you have to share!

&#x200B;

* Is it feasible to find an apartment in a short time frame, outside the summer college lease schedule?

My reason for asking is non-Summer listings are like:  
 — No date, then goes off market a few days later

— Available now, and also goes off market a few days later

— Available for a date in the past, but it’s a new post

— Availability in 1-8 weeks

&#x200B;

* Are Zillow & Trulia the best sites, or are there others locals use?

— So far, everything on Zillow & Trulia are pretty much what’s also listed on Hotpads and Craigslist, or better. Someone suggested [Apartments.com](http://apartments.com/) but that’s been mostly corporate owned complexes and not a lot of unique listings, either.

&#x200B;

* Is there, or should I be using, an apartment locator service or realtor to make my life easier and find properties for me?

— My experience includes MA, where you almost always need to go through a realtor or broker (and pay hefty fees), and in TX there are apartment locators or realtors who get a fee from the apartment complex or owner.

— So far, most listings are management companies/realtors and not individual landlords. Is that common for the area?

&#x200B;

* I saw the post about management companies to avoid, but it’s pretty old.

— Any more recent problematic ones to watch out for?

— These are the most prolific on Trulia/Zillow right now:

Costello Management

Franklin West

HH Property Management

Howard West Properties

JJ Land

Rubix Management - Michael Caliguiri

&#x200B;

* What is the best way to see a lot of places in a short period like one weekend?

— What's worked for you, when you've been short on time or couldn't spend weeks looking?

&#x200B;

* How do the rental management companies work in PGH?

— Do you meet them at their office and they drive you to the properties? (that’s common here in TX with apartment locators and realtors who do property management)

— Or would you meet them at each property on your own and/or use a lockbox code for a self-guided tour?",BitsOfPuzzle,13,17,0.73

408,Weekend trip: should I visit Pittsburgh or Columbus?,10x5ixl,"I’m from Southern Ontario, Canada and I’m looking to go away for the weekend with my girlfriend. It’s our anniversary and we’d like to see a place we haven’t been before. After checking distance and activities to do, it looks like like Cleveland and Pittsburgh are the best options. But after doing some research I saw that Columbus has more to offer and is safer than Cleveland but it’s a couple hours further. 

I like the fact that Pittsburgh is very walkable but there seems to be a limited number of food and daytime entertainment options. Columbus seems to have it all (food, nightlife, comedy clubs, cool daytime attractions) but it’s also a bit less safe from what I’ve read. 

So, if anyone can share which of the two (Columbus & Pittsburgh) you’d recommend checking out for a weekend at the end of feb and what are some good entertainment options we should do. Also, we’re on a bit of a budget.

EDIT: 
I’m leaning toward Pittsburgh based on everyone’s suggestions so please lmk if there’s certain things you’d recommend checking out.

472,The Future of Downtown,10vbthx,"I wanted to start a thread after reading various posts over the past several weeks/months on this subreddit regarding the state, and more specifically, the future of Downtown.  There are several things that I think are fairly clear.

* We will never see a full return to pre-pandemic numbers of workers downtown. WFH has proven to be viable for plenty of industries, and many employees are unwilling to return to a full in-person setting.
* Because of this, we will never see a return to the office occupancy previously utilized, which will lead to a large amount of vacant real estate downtown. Not only this, but a large part of the foot traffic that drove local businesses in the area may never return.
* I have seen many people advocating for mixed use/residential to take up these vacancies, but have also heard that the costs and logistics of converting some of the larger/traditional skyscrapers, would make it unfeasible.
* There has been a notable increase in crime and homelessness in the downtown area.

If I'm being honest, these items make me very nervous about the future of our Downtown. It is a vital economic center of our community, and failing to find a way to revitalize it will lead to ripple effects throughout other parts of the city and metro area. I often see comments around here that basically equate to shoulder shrugging about the prospect of Downtown failing, but I don't think people realize what effects that will have on the larger region. It is impossible to ignore that prior to the pandemic, our Central Business District was on a very good trajectory, and now that appears to be stalled, and likely in decline.

So TL;DR - What do you see as the future of Downtown Pittsburgh, and how do you think it can be accomplished within the framework of our current economic state?",StormFreak,185,143,0.86

>  
>The Pittsburgh-based steelmaker saw revenue of $21.06 billion for 2022, up from $20.27 billion in 2021, and earnings were $2.5 billion, $9.16 a share, for the year, down from the record last year of $4.17 billion, $14.88 a share. [The earnings were released Thursday afternoon](https://investors.ussteel.com/news/news-details/2023/U.-S.-Steel-Delivering-on-Strategic-Commitments-Reports-Solid-Fourth-Quarter-and-Second-Best-Earnings-in-2022/default.aspx) after the close of the New York Stock Exchange.

>""2022 was another exceptional year for U. S. Steel, marking our second-best financial performance in the Company’s history,"" said President and CEO [David B. Burritt](https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/search/results?q=David%20B.%20Burritt) in a statement. Burritt and other executives will be talking with financial analysts and reviewing the company's performance Friday morning in the quarterly conference call.  
>  
>U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) fourth-quarter revenue dropped from $5.6 billion in 2021 to $4.3 billion in 2022, while revenue slid from $1.1 billion, $3.75 a share, in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $174 million, 68 cents a share, in 2022. The big story in revenue was in the tubular segment, which saw a sharp increase. The mini mill and U.S. Steel segments posted losses while flat-rolled steel saw a drop in sales.  
>  
>""Our fourth-quarter results exceeded our guidance expectations thanks to the combined efforts of our domestic steelmaking operations and Tubular segment,"" Burritt said.  
>  
>He said there was a positive EBITDA in mini mill in December and that showed positive momentum.

>Burritt also voiced optimism for 2023, saying that the company would continue to with shareholder rewards after $900 million was returned to shareholders in 2022.  
>  
>""We are already delivering on strategic commitments, including the Gary Works pig iron machine that was commissioned ahead of schedule and on-budget,"" Burritt said. ""Later this year, our non-grain oriented electrical steel line at Big River Steel will begin producing advanced steel grades to meet the growing electric vehicle demand.""

You go up to customer service and tell them you have Flashfood items. They come out from behind the desk and, if it's perishable, they get your item from a dedicated refrigerator at the front of the store, the one that was in the picture on the app. You order from the picture. You purchase before you go.

There are meats (e.g., $24 roast for $12), but anything from breads to fruit and veggie boxes (you have to buy it based on the picture, at $5), you get the idea. It's a way to move nearly out of date items. I got beef short ribs at Squirrel Hill GE at $7 marked down from $14.

554,Robinson Walmart in home delivery is a joke.,10rvqc5,"So my wife and I enjoy the convenience of Walmart delivery. It’s worth paying a little extra to a dasher or the subscription to Walmart+. We had a couple less than ideal interactions with dashers. Nothing serious or even worth complaining about, but we recently opted for the Walmart+ in home delivery since that is apparently serviced by Walmart employees and we have no intention for anything to be delivered further than our front door. It is a complete joke. 

We had an order that was to be delivered last Sunday. Not arrived. Tried to call the store. No answer. Called customer service. They couldn’t get ahold of the store. We were told the order would be delivered the next day(Monday). Nothing arrived. My wife and I decided to not stress about it because it is just not worth getting worked up about and we expected that this is just in process. Tuesday nothing arrived. Called customer service a again they could not get ahold of the store and had no explanation. So today (Thursday) we found that our order has been canceled due to driver unavailability.

In addition to this being aggravating in general it’s worth noting that each time we contacted customer service we were given a 10 dollar credit to apply to our next order, but apparently they have to be used on separate orders. This is in addition to not knowing if we should go to the closer Giant Eagle and purchase food that should be in our order. Being GE is more expensive and not wanting to duplicate purchases. And then also if I was going to go shopping anyway why would I even attempt delivery. We ended up door-dashing and making due until now when we have found our order canceled.

This is also the second time something like this has happened. The last time I opened the door to get the mail a couple days after the order was expected to find parts (just some of the items) of our order including frozen food sitting outside. It was not cold enough to stay frozen and we had no idea it was there. Also, this last time on Sunday when we checked the status in the app it said “no video available because delivery was hand delivered to customer”.  We had received nothing.

I think I’m going to rather pay fees and tips to door dash than to have no idea if the order will actually arrive.",Extra_Security_665,37,0,0.26

But to qualify for it, you have to be uninsured (or ""underinsured"") and that's where it gets confusing to me. Because:

- If one's income is low enough, one qualifies for Medicaid itself and wouldn't need this program.
- If one's income is above that cutoff but not too high, one can qualify for and buy private health insurance and get assistance with premiums through the Pennie PA state health insurance marketplace. 

So how would a person find themselves uninsured? Because they chose not to buy a private insurance plan? Would there be any downsides to doing this and using the UPMC program?

Either live in northside (near Allegheny center/ Allegheny west specifically) and walk/bike to work (near football stadium) but have to drive to meet people OR live in more ideal social scene such (Lawrenceville or Shadyside) to meet people in my age group (22-30) at expense of commuting  25-40min via car during peak traffic each way (according to google's ""depart at"") as well as have to walk additional 5-10 from parking lot to office. In either case it, it seems like I will need to commute half the week so not sure which is better.

EDIT #1: Big reason why I wanted to consider the more social areas vs short commute is because I am moving here across the country and don't know anybody at all and am afraid it will be difficult to meet initial group of people if I live where there isn't too much to do relative to lawrenceville/shadyside.

EDIT #2: Didn't expect this many comments so probably won't have chance to respond to each of you but wanted to say thank you to all since all opinions give me a better picture even though some of you disagree with one another which is honestly expected since everyone has different preferences for living.

EDIT #3: Also I hope I didn't give off the impression that I think people outside the age group I mentioned are not social, I mainly emphasized that age range since in that last place I lived, all my neighbors were 10-40 years older than me and even though they were all awesome people, there was a disconnect since they have other responsibilities such as children that at this time, I could not relate to.

Greetings yinz

I just want to put this here in care anyone needs it and is in a similair spot to me: no care credit, stuck with insurance, making too much to get sliding scale but living paycheck to oaycheck. You are worth the effort to live, and that means taking care of ur teeth.

I ended up going to Dr. Julia Dentice's practice at the rec of a friend. My dentist was Dr. Rumbaugh. 

There's not a lot of info online but the whole practice is a hidden gem. They have their own in house payment plan. Together with my Cigna 5000/250 insurance I have a way forward that is in what i can do. The entire time I was treated like a real person and not a wallet and she was ready and willing to do everything on my teeth without even discussing money in depth. She answered all my questions, was patient with my anxiety and teeth in need of serious work. I'm two appointments in and I finally feel like I have a way out of the muck. 

She encouraged me to keep my teeth and go for root canal rather than extract the worst of it, for my long term health. When I yold her the thousands I'd been quoted for several root canals at a ""chain"" dentist, she explained why that wasn't what i needed and that they could save my teeth. With the payment plan, and how kind the entire staff is... I really can't describe how I feel.

Please if you've been putting off dental and you can't get help on a sliding scale and are too anxious to go to the student clinic like me, and can pay but just need more time, patience, etc, please please please get to a dentist. You are worth that effort. I couldn't recommend Dr. Dentice's practice enough. I hope this or even the information others have posted here helps you.

-=-=-

Hey y'all, giving a bit of context- thanks for reading-

I've been in the burgh for 2 years now- I have bad adhd and am suffering the toothy consequences despite trying to get my life in order, lol- So was finally able to get onto dental insurance- Cigna 5000/250- but I learned that on top of the 24 month waiting period, I can only get one major procedure done every 60 months. They don't really put that in your face until after you buy in, and I guess I didn't have enough insurance experience to even think that was a thing. I know I'll have some fillings, some root canals, which means crowns, or extractions and eventually either shelling out for implants or bridges or who knows.

Anyways. Looking for any answers/experience/dentist recommendations from anyone in my shoes- needing major dental work, has (bad?) insurance, possibly if you've used a discount plan. I'm not sure I have the guts to go to the Pitt dental school. I don't think Care Credit will take me, as I have a good credit score but was denied the pre-approval on a guesstimate.

I'm looking at potentially switching to Spirit Dental or the Cigna Dental Discount Savings Plus Plan, but I'm not getting clear answers from dentists when I try to call about if it's accepted. Spirit goes through Ameritas and when I called one dentist about the savings plan, the receptionist said ""they might not take it, it just depends, it can be too cheap."" And I just don't know if dropping money on something that might work but might not is worth it.

I've tried reaching out to sliding-scale clinics. Northside Christian isn't getting back to me and the one in Southside isn't taking new patients. 

If you have any experience, in any of these plans or services or anything, I'd greatly appreciate your input. I am so afraid of dying to an infected tooth that I'm going crazy, haha. Thank you!",Furlabun,21,0,0.5

Weather is a bit of a drag but the totally flat landscape with decent parks and nature and views hours and hours and hours away is the bigger deal breaker. 

I already asked about your pizza 😂 and it seemed good enough to do the trick 

Generally speaking, it seems a fair bit warmer if not drastically (officially the average is 5 degrees I believe). It has about a month less sun sadly - but recreational opportunity seems vastly superior (avid hill runner) 

Driving (I don’t own a car in Chicago just rent one from time to time) seems tricky based off the ice and hills I here. I imagine I Can find good walkable neighborhoods (I lived in Oakland CA without a car and didn’t find it a major trouble. Although I did go on some quite long walks to do many things.

But I realize a car will basically be essential when it comes down to it -

It's just me and my fiance, I shower at the gym 4 days a week (more relevant to water heater cost than water bill) and we set our thermostat to 67 degrees.

Over the past 3 months our utilities bills have averaged

Water: $43/mo

Electric: $335/mo

Gas: $225/mo.

That's a total of $600/mo, which is over 40% of what our freaking mortgage is!

Before we moved we had an 1,110 sq ft place in Roanoke VA and our electric was about $130/mo and water was $9/mo and the electric included our heating so this is a shock to us unless something crazy is going on like we're somehow getting charged for our neighbor as well by mistake.

Is this normal for the area?

It contained my ID, insurance cards, credit cards, membership cards, and $70 cash - as well as some mostly used gift cards. 

Shortly (~2-hours) after I lost it, 5 fraudulent charges appeared on one of my credit card accounts: 2 at Glass Zone and 3 at Carson News & Lottery (all betweeen 11:00pm-11:45pm.)

I've filed a police report, per advice from my bank and the local police station - but figured I'd post here just in-case someone happens to find it. (I'm honestly assuming it was tossed in the garbage or could still be in the possession of whoever had been using my credit card. I've already cancelled and re-ordered all cards but I wouldn't mind getting back my ID.)

The second tree is alive and well, but hasn't not been maintained and has some larger branches over my roof so it needs trimmed at a minimum. 

First question - what's the best way to determine if the trees are on my property line? I'm 95% sure the first tree is on my property, but I'm 50/50 on the second tree.

Second question - if the tree that needs trimmed isn't mine, who's responsibility is it to maintain it? Mine (because the branches are over my yard) or my neighbor's (because the tree is on their property)?

30,Greetings from 2 midwesterners living in Austin looking at Pittsburgh as a potential home,11ven36,"Hello Pittsburgh Reddit fam- I have always been very fond of your city and people from the standpoint of a touring musician who has burst out of the Fort Pitt tunnel and performed there on various occasions. (even had a drummer who lived there). 

Back story: I grew up in St. Louis, have lived in Chicago,Mpls,KC,LA,Florida,Colorado and Austin for the last 17 years. I have ton of family over on the East Coast. My fiancé who has never been to PGH, is a tattoo artist whose emphasis is “black and grey” art. She’s Polish, & from Detroit & has lived in Austin for the last 6 years.  Understandably she misses the 4 seasons and a closer proximity to family in MI. She loves forests with tall trees and skies loaded with gloom,& gorgeous autumns, which ain’t Austin). I dig hilly-mountainous topography as opposed to flat farmland. 

Having lived almost 2 decades through the dramatic changes in Austin, I am ready for a new adventure and hopefully a forever home for us. In the event of a move, we will miss friends & the simpler times when Austin was less crowded and more affordable with less lines to do pretty much anything. Those long hot summers tho😳! We don’t seek life in a massive metropolis.  ATX & PGH are somewhat similar in size. While the cities do tend to share some other similarities,I understand there exists immense differences that hopefully you can help us delineate .

In our quest to discover more, we are coming up to visit PGH in mid June. We have a few friends there and hope make many more!  We want to explore the arts, gothic architecture, food, unique neighborhoods, bars, parks/outdoors, and music scene there from Heavy metal-punk-jazz-avant-garde. (Yes we both love heavy rock music so any ties into those communities are encouraged) 

Any advice for us?
How do you see Pittsburgh growing and progressing? 
Healthy music/arts from your POV?
What ideas could people bring into PGH that would improve the city?
What would you want to see more of? Less of?
Up and coming neighborhoods to check out?

Again,PGH from a geographical standpoint puts us right in the middle of family and far more cities than down here in TX.

I moved back to the area a couple of months ago to stay with family after the dissolution of a relationship. It’s a long story, but I came out to them today and am now facing homelessness with my cat as a consequence of that decision if I can’t figure something out immediately.

If we were out of winter I would just find a nice tree somewhere and make it work but I have health issues that make it difficult for me to maintain my body temp, so I could die in the cold. Also obviously worried about my cat, who I could never subject to that kind of life, but I also don’t know where is safe for the both of us. 
I’m going to bullet point some stuff to try to summarize more succinctly. 

• I’m 28, nonbinary, and currently in Verona

• I am autistic and physically disabled

• I am employed but do not make enough at current job, and haven’t had luck with interviews yet 

• I have about $500 in the bank currently 

• I do not have any other family to stay with, and I do not have any friends or other human support system at the moment. 

I reached out to a couple of coworkers in the hopes that I might get a header on someone that needs a roommate, but haven’t heard back from anyone. 

I know there is a shelter in the Alle-Kiski area that accepts pets at an adjacent kennel as well, but I am not sure if I will have the resources together to actually have a home by the time a short-term shelter stay expires. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m really scared. Please reserve any judgement if you don’t vibe with this post, but please, if you have any sound advice or tips or anything at all that could help, i would be so grateful. Thank you for reading.

49,New book from regional author,11uv67v,"Hi, Pittsburgh! I’m an author from Southeastern Ohio who just released a collection of short stories for an Appalachian/Rust Belt audience. 

We may like rival teams but if you had an upbringing in the general area, I think you’ll be able to connect with the book. The stories are typically supernatural in theme but are centered around subjects like county fairs and family beach vacations to Myrtle Beach. Think of it as an Appalachian Twilight Zone. 

Also, there’s a whole story in there about my dislike for Cincinnati Chili. We may not support the same squads but I’m sure this is a safe space for that opinion. In fact, the protagonists of that particular story are Pirates fans.

82,What do you like about Pittsburgh compared to other major US cities you have lived in or visited?,11ti4fv,"Hi all,
So me and my S.O (mid 20’s) are kind of at a crossroads of what we want to do. We are both originally from the area, moved away for college, and moved to the city proper for our careers. Our careers let us be transient so we have been deciding to stay in Pittsburgh (Our family is also all close here), Move to DC, Move to LA, or move to NYC (we would have col adjust). So I was wondering - For those who lived in other cities, What do you like about Pittsburgh compared to the others?

My pros:

-The people, Every city I have visited I feel like Pittsburgh has the best people. I don’t know if it’s the blue collar-esque history, But even out of town people who moved here everyone I have met has been great, and have made friends really easily here. I like how in Pittsburgh you can have a random conservation with anyone, And it’s natural like you’ve known them, Also the lack of stand-offness. I think this also shows in our Reddit, Compared to other cities reddit’s I’ve asked questions in. It’s like the opposite of the “Seattle Freeze” 

-The neighborhood aspect, I know this isn’t exactly unique, But I specifically love our neighborhoods and how each one could almost be a town. 

-The culture, I just love it, I grew up with it, and it’s something I brag about to my friends in other cities.

-Cost of buying a house, Especially compared to the others on the list.

Cons:

-Stuff closes early compared to other cities, This is a huge thing as I’m a night owl, When I visited a friend NYC I realized just how stark it is. Though I love certain parts of our nightlife, It all closes early. 

-The pollution, Though I do think Pittsburgh has a great trajectory, With such a tech and healthcare focus and constant tracking and talk about our pollution, You don’t see this as much in cities with worse pollution. (I had no idea how bad LA was) 

-Sameness, It would just be staying with the familiar, Though maybe tons of traveling could make up for this.

-Lack of options, Though I love the restaurants I frequent, It isn’t say - NYC in terms of food choices/Things to do.",TheMiddlePoli,141,31,0.72

146,Landlord not taking issue seriously,11r9g1q,"I have a situation I'd like some opinions on. I moved into my current apartment over the summer and it was great. No issues. Then the weather changed and all the tenants started using their heat. The furnace in the unit above me produces a loud dripping sound basically 24/7 in my bedroom which is also my office (I WFH). Loud enough that earplugs don't work at all. It is genuinely difficult to fall asleep. Additionally, right where the dripping sound comes from there was a suspicious black spot on the ceiling. I cleaned it shortly after moving in but after a month of the dripping noise I did a mold culture and it grew mold. I've been going back and forth with the landlord's office since October and they went from saying there's nothing wrong but you can move out, to it's actually condensation from the exhaust and they'll try adding insulation to the pipe, and now back to they can't do anything. Is there an agency I can contact? It feels like they aren't taking it seriously. I can't imagine it being good for there to be something leaking in the ceiling like this, plus the mold. I don't really want to move and even if I do, the next tenant is going to hear this and complain. It's not like this place is a dump either. I've lived in worse apartments and have never had an issue like this.

TLDR: loud ass constant dripping noise in the ceiling, grew mold while the last tenant was here and also maybe currently?, LL not holding up their end of the lease for my right to ""quiet enjoyment"" of the property.",g_h_o_s_t_,17,25,0.84
147,"Planning to move family to Pittsburgh, what neighborhood/suburb fits our needs",11r8fg4,"Hi all, I searched and found a lot of threads similar to this that were aimed for a younger audience, I hope this is different enough to warrant its own thread.

Long story short, we've visited Pittsburgh in the past and just spent this last weekend there getting a feel for different areas.  We're due to have twins in September and are planning to make an offer in the next month or sooner.  We're both 35, stable in our careers with full WFH capabilities.  We chose pittsburgh because we've always liked it and it is equidistant from families..best of all worlds.

So we're asking the hive mind what neighborhoods or suburbs say within 30 minutes meet what we're looking for, in priority order:

1. Bigger (2800 sq ft+), single family detached houses with sizeable yards for a budget between 500-700K.  Newer or older construction isn't as important as size and yard.
2. Neighborhood/community safety -- it's important that we feel safe taking a walk, especially my wife who is on the smaller side and will be pushing a stroller soon enough
3. Very good or great public schools, or in the area of outstanding private schools.

Things we'd really like but aren't deal breakers.

* A walkable central business district with restaurants/shops, even if we have to drive to it.
* Sidewalks or parks with walking trails, even if it's a short drive away.
* Relative proximity to I79 or the Turnpike as we expect to have a lot of elderly family visiting from those highways. (we have friends in the Highland Park neighborhood which we like, but can't imagine either of our parents navigating to there)
* It's wishful thinking to predict the future but we'd like a neighborhood that is going to still be a good place to live in \~20 years or so as we plan on making this our home.    

We both drive so public transportation isn't necessary but wouldn't hurt.

150,10 story 117 apartment building in Shadyside approved by Zoning Board last night,11r5ci8,"This was posted about back in December when a NIMBY Shadyside landlord attached handouts to people's cars: https://old.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/zg5y29/nimbyism_in_shadyside/ 

Story from the Pure Garbage:

> #Size matters: Scaled-back Shadyside apartment project wins city zoning board approval

>A developer’s gamble to reduce the size of a controversial Shadyside apartment project to win city approval has paid off.

>The Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment approved several variances and a special exception Monday that will enable Mozart Management and Camp Eight Capital to move forward with the 10-story complex at 525 S. Aiken Ave.

>In its 11-page decision, the zoning board concluded that approving the requests was “appropriate” given the evidence and testimony presented at a November hearing, and the community commitments and parking mitigation measures proposed by the development team.

>The ruling represents a bit of redemption for Mozart and Camp Eight after the same board last August shot down their proposal to build a 12-story, 131-unit apartment building at the site.

>In response, the developers revamped their plan, cutting the number of floors from 12 to 10, reducing the proposed height from 132 feet to 108 feet, and dropping the number of apartments to 117.

>However, the revised proposal did nothing to appease some Shadyside residents who live near the site and who raised concerns about the impact on traffic, parking and the overall character of the neighborhood.

>But the zoning board, in its ruling, found that the requested variances related to height and unit size “will not adversely affect the essential character of the neighborhood or the public welfare.”

>It also determined that the developers had presented “credible and unrefuted evidence that the increased density represented by the proposed development will not result in adverse traffic impacts and sufficient parking will be available on-site.”

>As part of their revised plan, Mozart and Camp Eight cut the number of vehicle spaces from 101 to 82 and eliminated one level of underground parking.

>Fifty of the 82 spaces will be available at the complex and another 32 in the parking lot for the adjacent Arlington Apartments owned by Mozart.

>In a statement released Monday, Zsolt Bessko, Mozart managing director, and David Gefsky, Camp Eight founder, called the board’s ruling “the successful culmination of a 20-month community-driven process to achieve the optimal design for a site at the vibrant S. Aiken and Centre Avenue corridor.”

>“The building’s design, operations, and context in relation to the surrounding area were improved with community input as part of this process,” they stated.

>The developers also maintained that the project will be one of the first mixed-market multifamily buildings in Shadyside to voluntarily designate 10% of its units as affordable to households making less than 80% of the area median income.

>“To create vibrant neighborhoods and cities, we need more density — done responsibly, appropriately, and sensitively,” the developers said. “Creating high-quality housing options for renters across the socio-economic spectrum in Shadyside is a step in the right direction.”

>In its ruling, the zoning board stated that it “appreciates the applicant’s efforts to address the lack of affordable housing in the city through increased density and their intent to provide affordable units in the proposed development.”

>Janine McVay, a Shadyside resident who opposed the development, declined comment Monday, saying the ruling was still being reviewed.

>As part of its ruling, the board also concluded that the revised design was “consistent with the adjacent building and other multi-story, multi-unit residential buildings in the immediate vicinity.”

>“The board notes that the applicant originally requested more significant variances with respect to height and density and, in response to community concerns and this board’s recommendation, reduced the scope of its requests,” it said.

>It further ruled that the development “would be the minimum that would allow for the economically feasible development of the site.”

>During the November hearing, Mr. Gefsky testified that without zoning relief the total number of apartments that could be built at the site would be 28 — at a cost of $489,004 a unit.

>At 117 apartments, the cost for each, he said, would be $356,017 — meaning rents would be 37.4% less than they would if a developer was limited to 28 units.

>The approval did come with conditions, including the pledge designating 10% of the units as affordable to those at 80% of the area median income.

>It also incorporated community benefits promised by the development team. They included design features to mitigate impacts of the building’s size and operations on nearby residential properties and streetscape and landscaping improvements along South Aiken and Claybourne Street.

>In addition, the development is required to prohibit building tenants from acquiring residential parking permits from the city.",threwthelookinggrass,126,131,0.9

They are serving dinners- I am not clear if they will be monthly or more weekly, but it is very particular atm- one seating- 6:00 PM on Thurs, Fri, Sat. One set chef's menu- 5 course. It says it will be communal seating and parties of 2, 4, or 6. So I am super curious what this whole experience is going to be like. \*Pay ahead\* and the pricing is far and above any restaurant in the vicinity. I would say the price is at least double the most expensive restaurant in the county. You'd have to drive into the city for something to match it- hopefully the food is worth it. I am hoping they will pull a crowd from the city, because while there are a lot of great vegan options there, there isn't really a gourmet vegan place and a lot of the upscale restaurants don't have many, if any vegan options (give me recommendations if you have any favorites!). 

I have a reservation for next week, which is the first weekend. I will report back.

In the summer, they'll be doing more casual lunches and soft serve as well. 

The place is really lovely and the owners are fabulous, so anyone looking for a nice vegan weekend getaway, I recommend!

They did a take-out vegan Valetine's dinner and that was amazing. A cheesecake that was really mind-blowing and pistachio baklava. They are also very allergen friendly.

She is a young, small woman and was going through Greenfield and Squirrel Hill when she noticed. She said something felt off about it so she kept an eye on the guy in the SUV and after too many similar turns, she pulled into a parking lot on Murray near Shady that has a security guard. 

The SUV went past the parking lot at first, but a few minutes later, the same SUV pulled into the parking lot and started driving slowly through the lot. She was across the lot by the security guard when the SUV pulled in, so she could see the guy leaning forward, scanning all of the cars, clearly looking for someone. The security guard went over to speak with the guy, and he flew out of the parking lot and left. My friend is currently trying to get video footage to get his plates, and she reported it to the police station.

Haven’t driven it in a while because it needs a lot of work. I recently started the process of getting it fixed and found out that it’s gonna cost 6 or 7 thousand more than I thought. One guy told me I’d be looking at around 3 or 4k for the repairs. Another guy took a closer look at everything and said it’ll be around 10k which is more than the car is worth. It needs a massive engine overhaul including a new ignition coil(s), cylinder work, new spark plugs and possibly the motor among other things. Also the brake system needs looked at because even though it has new pads, rotors and plenty of fluid, the pedal goes all the way to the floor (this wasn’t happening at all when I initially stopped driving it) and they don’t know if it’s a booster issue or the entire ABS system. The shop I’m working with won’t finance that high so I’m getting it salvaged.

I asked my buyer agent, and he said it is very common at Allegheny that old addition/remodel did not apply for a permit  (actually, according to him, before 21st Century, the permit system is in a mess, and nobody cares about it)

I would like to know if it is true, and is there any potential risk for a non-permitted addition? I read some posts about ""insurance refuses to cover the accidents caused by non-permitted work"" and ""tenants reported to the department about non-permitted work and refused to pay the rent"". It really scares me.  

Thank you everyone, and look forward to your opinions!",Nice_Charge8971,17,10,0.74
317,Living in Columbus…really wanna move to Pittsburgh,11ld8q4,"Hey everyone, new to the sub and new to your city in general. My mom grew up in Pittsburgh and my gf and I visited last weekend. I loved everything about it! Y’all are some great people and the culture in Pittsburgh seems wonderful. What are some ups/downs of the city? Why would you recommend it to new people? Why/why not?

Also, I’m a huge soccer fan. What’s the soccer culture like in Pittsburgh?

318,Dating in Pittsburgh - What am I in for...,11ld3ps,"I've moved back to Pittsburgh in the last year & pretty clueless about the dating environment scene.   

I was traveling a lot for work & noticed asking someone out the ""traditional"" or Old-Fashioned way is often looked at as creepy or unwarranted, in my major cities.  Similar here in Pittsburgh? 

Dating sites now being the default  - any particular winners for the area?  

I'm a straight male in my mid-30s.    

More curious to see if there is an actual scene (for my age range) more so than the quality. ( At least for now , worry about selection when/if get to that point) 

Any feedback would be incredible.",Augiehack,4,0,0.23

I have to be put under anesthesia and they cannot do the colonoscopy if I do not have somebody to drive me home.  It will only take about an hour.  I am supposed to prep today.  If you have ever prepared for a colonoscopy, you known what I am facing and I have already been thru the prep last month and found out they could not do it because I had blood clots.  I really don't want to drink this gallon of laxative again and have to cancel due to not having an escort.   Please Help...",theoth3rme,71,61,0.81

325,Pittsburgh Local tax/EIT as a non-resident,11l2vae,"Hello,

I am a Maryland resident, and I worked in Pittsburgh for 2 months in 2022. Due to Maryland and Pennsylvania having a reciprocal, my company did not withhold PA state tax, but a local tax was withheld from my paycheck, and based on the amount it looks like it was withheld at a rate of 1%. Looking at the city website, an EIT form should have been mailed to me by Jordan Tax Service, but I never received any form, and it looks like I am ineligible to fill the form online. So, I emailed JST and they said that I do not need to file EIT tax return as the employer had withheld at the rate of 1%. I just wanted to know if anyone has ever been in situation like these and if these seems correct, as I don't want to get into trouble later for not filing it.

Edit- My employer also withheld $14 of LST. should I be filing LST refund form that refund?",AnotherRandomGuy34,5,7,0.73

I’ve been WFH over that time. When I was going into the city before covid, I always parked in the melody lot across from City View. My question is; Is that lot still useable for parking? And if it is, what is the cost? I think I was paying $6.50 before covid. Thanks.",penguins8766,8,0,0.39
