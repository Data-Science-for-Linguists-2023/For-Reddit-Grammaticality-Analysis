0,Master Post: So you want to be a motherfucking successful ass adult,bl27uv,"  

So, you want to be a fucking successful adult. CONGRATS, I have written some how-to‚Äôs for you so you can start to get your fucking shit together. 

[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bgzqbc/how_to_be_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult/)

[Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh0m1l/being_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult_part/)

[Adulting with Depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/bh4lzh/how_to_adult_when_you_are_too_depressed_to/)

Here are some fucking FAQ‚Äôs on the parts I wrote so that you don‚Äôt have to scroll through and upvote every single nice comment in the comment section on all of the parts. 

Q: Are there going to be more parts?

A: Yeah probably. But I have a fucking life where I do things that aren‚Äôt writing how-to‚Äôs, so they will arrive whenever I am feeling generous enough to give advice and have the energy to write about said advice. 

Q: You should write a book.

A: Thank you, I am. The book is in the works, basically it‚Äôs a fucking 100-page rant where I talk about how to wash your balls. 

Q: How old are you? Are you a boy or a girl?

A: I am an adult. I will not tell you my age because once I do you will suddenly have all these pre-conceived judgements about the quality of the advice I give. But here is a hint, I am older than 18 and younger than 50. I am a person. Take a guess on my gender and if you get it right Ill give you a fucking star. 

Q: Why can‚Äôt you write normally?

A: Because there are a bajillion fucking self-help books out there written normally, and there are like 5 that are written in a way that people fucking relate to and listen to. If cursing *turns you off* then good. I only want readers who can fucking read this shit with a boner 6 miles long. 

Q: I have a tip that you don‚Äôt mention, can you add it to the article?

A: Sure, if its actually fucking good. Send me a message with your advice that you think is good enough to make it, and I‚Äôll add it to the end of the article and credit you. 

Q: I run a podcast/YouTube channel/ blog, can I interview you or have you guest speak?

A: Generally, yes. My time is precious, so if you want me to write something completely new for your shit its going to take a while and will probably cost you more than exposure. 

Q: What do you do when you aren‚Äôt cussing people out on the internet?

A: I own a business and am a stay at home parent. When I am not writing, I am packing orders, creating or listing new product, taking care of my son, or playing with my two dogs. I rarely have any down time.

If you have more questions you want answered or have an idea for an article you want me to write, send me a PM. I will decide if its cool enough for me to respond to it.",kainaible,60,1478,0.99

4,What are some non-routine personal care / hygiene tasks I can do to really totally reset after a rough few weeks?,11vxby3,"I just wrapped up a very difficult project at work, during which I severely neglected my self-care. What are some of the less-frequent, very thorough personal hygiene tasks I can do to really feel good, like a fresh new person?

It's not that I'm literally super gross, I just psychologically want a sort of physical catharsis.

For example, I really want to take a bath (after my shower) where I can soak my head in the water for a long long time and then really scrub my scalp extra good.

In case it helps, I'm a guy but I'm happy to hear about all the pampering techniques and secrets that I'm sure the ladies are more knowledgeable about.

7,Friends Preferences Dictating Groups Activities. Advice Welcomed!!,11vu0l8,"My friend introduced me to another friend of hers, and since then we've all been hanging out with a few others.
This person doesn't like or is afraid of certain activities or genres of movies, which is fine.
However, the group enjoys these activities, and we enjoyed (before meeting her), doing them together.
And it seems like when we get together we often have to avoid doing these things, because this one person doesn't like it.
It seems like she doesn't know how to gracefully  bow out or compromise around these things. It seems likely we don't have the okay to so these without her.

We decided one year to go to an amusement park that was having a seasonal event, and it was going to be a joint birthday celebration for me and her.
I was looking forward to it, so I proposed we go together since the seasonal aspect of the event began much later in the day (7pm), and we would have all day (beginning at 10 am) before the event to do things, she likes and enjoys.
I thought after she could go home if she wanted. I didn't say the above sentence to her, I just thought she would understand a compromise was being made her. A win, win situation for her.

And she kept insisting that didn't want to do that thing because of that seasonal aspect.
I just found it a little odd, because it seems like she wasn't trying to compromise.

If it were me, I would just leave once the event began, out of respect for the day that is being celebrated or so that group can bond over something that they enjoy.
How would you handle this situation? 
I understand the importance of compromise but does that mean the group is never allowed to bond over these activities again, because of this person?
I want to find a way for us to enjoy these activities without making someone feel excluded or bothersome.",Brilliant-Fall1687,1,2,1.0

9,Is it worth going university in my mid 20s?,11vxo7a,"The degree I‚Äôm interested in is Human Resource Management and Psychology. I will also receive a CMI level 5 qualification in leadership and management as part of the course.I‚Äôm interested in working in working in a few different areas (HR, L&D, CDP) and will probably transition during my working life. I feel like the degree is the most transferable in terms of what I‚Äôd like to pursue. A big part of wanting to finish this particular degree is personal achievement as it was the same degree I was excited to do the first time I went university.

However due an abusive living situation (DV) I dropped out my 2nd year.The program is part time distance learning based and I intend to complete it whilst continuing to work full-time. Another reason I‚Äôm interested in doing the degree it would allow me a foundation to do either a 1 years teaching program or QCD qualification which would be a requirement to work in certain roles. I understand that a degree isn‚Äôt a guaranteed pathway to a successful career and that experience is essential. However I thought it could be valuable to have higher education and it could help me transition into a new field.  

My close friend who graduated a few years ago told me it was my choice when I discussed it with her but it didn‚Äôt help her career prospects much.She went to a reputable university and graduated with a first class degree but works hospitality part time and takes on gigs in her field when able available.

12,Advice: should I move in with my boyfriend at the age of 19?,11vrcvb,"My boyfriend, 19, and I, 19, have been together for 1 year. We got an offer to rent a 1 bedroom through a good friend for 1,500 dollars a month, including utilities and a washer and dryer. Living where we live, that sounded like a great offer. We work part time and go to school full time. When we heard the news, we were so excited. We are kind of confused on what to do because although it‚Äôs a great opportunity to grow as young adults, we both know we need to save money for our future. If we did move in together, we might be living paycheck to paycheck. With little money on the side. It‚Äôs a great modern apartment, in a great location for the both of us. School and work would only be 10-15 minutes away. Although we‚Äôre still young, my boyfriend and I are constantly together. Everyday. We sleep at each other‚Äôs houses, we spend money to cook food, etc.

1. Getting things together the night before. This helps. Once out of bed I get ready in few minutes only..Still late though.

2. Driving super fast. My coworkers saw me and called me a racecar driver. I know that's not smart. 

3. Not using snooze. Instead of being few minutes late I sleep through alarm and I'm 2 hours late instead. So I use three alarms to get up, all with snooze. Two with musical alarms on my phone and one is a buzzer that gets louder. 

4. Setting alarms earlier.. I still get up at the same time and ignore them longer. I get headache rest of the day  from the alarms going off so much. 

5. I've gone to a therapist. She found out problem started in 2nd grade when my mom started to yell abusivly every morning to get me up. I just remember it being miserable to begin my days like that. Still don't like mornings not sure if its because of that. All through high school too. Even when I go back home to stay she will yell at me to get up or get ready to go somewhere faster..Still late though and lost my previous job while going to the therapist. 

6.Talked to the doctor (last week). He suggested I take a sleep study and might have sleep apnea or something but I don't snore. I do toss around a lot while sleeping. Unfortunately I can't pursue this one because I lost my current full time job this Friday so I've also lost my health insurance.

15,Help! I've been avoiding emails for months and feel like a terrible person. How can I dig myself out of this hole?,11uqxk6,"Hi everyone,

I'm feeling really overwhelmed and guilty because I've been avoiding answering emails and messages from a lot of people since December. This includes important people who work for a grant I received for a project, as well as people from my university who are in charge of the grant bureaucracy.

I know it's not cool to ignore them, and they recently wrote to me saying it's urgent that I respond. Instead of just answering them, I'm now stuck in a loop of feeling ashamed and unprofessional and wanting to hide under a stone.

I realize these people are helping me and giving me money, and I don't have any good explanation for not answering them. I feel like I've done something horrible, but I don't know what to write back to them now.

Could anyone help me with what I can write in my emails to the grant people? I really don't know how to explain this without oversharing, but I also want to apologize and make things right. I'm open to any tips or personal experiences you may have.

To make matters worse, I've also been ignoring messages from my student health insurance and friends. I feel like an egocentric incapable adult.

I know there are reasons for my procrastination, like my mom's complicated surgery and stress with finding a flat, and that I have ADHD and depression. But these aren't good reasons for avoiding responsibilities for so long.

I need advice on how to apologize and make things right with these people, and how to start addressing my avoidance behavior. Any tips or personal experiences would be appreciated. Thanks.

28,How to deal with anger at bad drivers on the road?,11ubf99,"28M, from the USA

When I am driving and another driver isn't following the rules, to the point of making everyone unsafe and scaring me, I get angry.  I get really angry, and I want to do something.  

I know there isn't anything I can do, but save my dashboard camera video if I want to.  But I will get so upset and it will bother me for a few days.  Like I was going 45mph on a busy blvd and this old lady drove right through a turning lane with a yield sign.  I swerved into the other lane or she would've hit me, and she actually honked at me.  I got so angry, I wanted to do something to her or her car.  

Another time I was further up the road and someone backed out of their driveway right in front of me.    It was busy and I had to swerve out of the way, thankfully nothing happened.  But I was so mad and shaken up. 

A few months ago I backed out of a parking space, and before I could put my car into drive, another car backed out.  They backed up more and more.  I honked with my hand on the wheel but they still backed right into me.  The lady got out and said I rear ended her, it was some lady in her 30s with her teenage daughter.  They got out and pointed at marks on their car, I got absolutely furious and told them I had a dash cam and witnesses.  They rushed into their car and drive away, but I wanted to do something.  I'm a 6'4"" man and I was turning red with anger so I'm sure that helped - or didn't.

I just get this angry feeling like I need to do something and it bothers me for days.  I feel so powerless and without control and it really frustrates me, like I feel this pressure.

Does everyone feel this way?

How can I deal with these feelings?

30,"Moving back to home city after graduation, can't decide whether to live closer to job or closer to city",11ursjv,"I am about to graduate, I originally had a job offer in the city but ended up taking one that paid higher in the suburbs near where I grew up. It is about 25 miles, 30 minutes (on a lucky trafficless day) outside the city in the *center* of suburbia. Now, a part of me just wants to get an apartment right nearby, its affordable and would make my daily commute easy. However, the thought of living in the exact same area I grew up in is not appealing and I would prefer living closer to the city as a young person who likes to go out. 

So I guess my question is would I be dumb if I got an apartment half way between work and the city just to have closer access to the city? I am pretty sure I would be reverse commuting (going out as everyone commutes in) so traffic hopefully wouldn't be awful. It may be silly to consider too but ubering if I do go out would also be much cheaper since I would be so much closer to where everything happens.

He's a David Goggins-level, extremely strong person, knows me better than almost anyone, and is the closest thing I often feel I have to family, so when he said ""I know you struggle too man, get the help you need before you end up as bad as me or worse"" I took it to heart.

Not seeking medical advice or anything like that just venting; I consider getting on top of things like insurance and dentists adulting and I suppose y'all can judge if it belongs in the sub.

His collapse came from a long history starting with trauma and then working extremely hard to live a meaningful life and, generally as time went on, working harder and harder to suppress that trauma until he simply couldn't any more. I feel I have reached a similar point.

So I've started texting friends, accepting that I simply can't leave the house some days because I'm too tired/depressed, and making those phone calls to doctors and so forth my #1 priority. It's mostly been for counseling but I'm considering inpatient too, not because I'm acutely depressed/suicidal but I just need a break and have no way of taking one.

I feel truly awful sometimes when I think hey I'm in my early 30's, and not only am I not succeeding at my life goals, I am not even moving sort of in a direction to accomplish them. I just watch all these other people, often much younger, get promoted, get married, have children, and life is literally passing me by. I'm not living up to my potential and it is truly tragic.

When I was a kid, though, the best thing I could have done was cope and gtfo of that messed up family that dragged me down, confused the fuck out of me and sucked the life out of me. Now I'm an adult and, having accomplished the hard parts (working my ass off, finishing school, burning out again and  again and again and again) things are OK now.

The problem would be my 34 year old brother, who will never move out. I have the income to support myself but stay to save money while he has never worked a full time job in his life. He has worked as one of those sample ladies at Walmart for 15 years, getting a maximum of 20 hours a week. No savings and very inconsistent hours. Some weeks he only works four hours. My parents and I have had a brief talk about this before, as they're in their mid-60s, which is around the life expectancy of their families. My mom said my brother and I can share the house or one of us can buy the other out. But if I bought him out, which I could afford to do, he'd have nowhere to stay and wouldn't be able to afford a place. But he wouldn't be able to afford to buy me out and so I'd just ultimately lose out and he'd get the house, basically, for free. I can't share the house with him unless we somehow divide it into a duplex. We havent spoken to each other in probably 15 years, despite living together. He is sloppy, lazy, rude, and just generally careless. Like if a cat gets sick on a rug, he won't clean it up, he'll just let it dry up and walk over it. Or if there's one of those abominable stink bugs, he'll ignore it instead of killing it or at least putting it outside. And the bathroom is disgusting when he's done with it every morning. He's also too fat to do anything like shoveling snow or mowing the lawn so basically, all of the maintenance would fall on me. And I love doing maintenance work. That's part of why I want a house so bad. I genuinely love doing the upkeep. But constantly cleaning up after someone who has never once pulled their weight in life is just insulting. It's insulting to think that he'll likely inherit the house simply by choosing not to work harder at anything in life. He'll come out farther ahead than I have even though right now, I'm working three different remote jobs to save up for retirement and a house. If my brother takes over the house and I move out, he won't keep up on any maintenance and it'll just rot away. He won't see any problem with it though because that's just how we were raised, I suppose. If something is even mildly inconvenient, ignore it instead of fixing it. I can see him just letting the roof leak and putting out buckets to catch the drips instead of calling someone to fix it. Of course, he wouldn't be able to afford to fix it. Or even a bucket.



Obviously all of this is hypothetical. I realize anything could happen and my parents could get sick, lose the house, whatever. I'm talking about if things play out this way and the house ends up in both of our names, do I just lose? Once our parents are gone and my brother can't paye half the value of the house, am I just out of luck? It's the only thing they'll leave for us because we're far from rich. I actually have more money in savings than they do at this point. It just seems so unfair that by doing nothing all of his life, my brother will still win.",aunttjemima,261,249,0.88

42,"Moving out of state, trade in, purchase in new state. I have no clue what to do here. Any guidance appreciated.",11ub8wr,"Hi friends - thanks in advance for any help you can give. This might be the wrong place to post this question. My apologies in advance if so

&#x200B;

Let me explain the situation - Friend from another state is moving here. She's about 5 hours away. Her current car is quite unreliable, and we need help on how to navigate trading in/offloading her car and purchasing a newer car.

&#x200B;

My question is this: her current car (2006 Volvo xc90, 133000 miles) would be a crapshoot to make the move here in one piece. It's questionable as a daily driver, (thankfully her work is a mile and a half away) but any long road trip seems out of the question. To compound the issue, the drive from her small town to my city involves unavoidable mountain travel - a quarter of the way at least are steep ascents followed by steep descents. 

&#x200B;

She wants to purchase a newer, more reliable vehicle. Her town has no dealership options, so she searched Carvana and became attached to a 2019 Toyota Rav4 for $28,000. In fact, she almost pulled the trigger on one the other night (at 13% APR, 72 months) before I returned her call and talked her out of making a quick decision. 

&#x200B;

I'm finding Certified Pre-Owned Toyotas in my city for cheaper ($23k-26k vs 27k), and at much better interest rate for in-house financing. Ideally I'd like to buy the car here and get rid of her car without towing it here or trying to drive it (I need to drive the UHaul, she is terrified of trying to limp the car here) For reference, the used car market in her town is laughable at best - there are 2000 people, most of whom are well-funded private college students there for the summer. A private party sale seems a stretch, especially given our time limit.

&#x200B;

Simply stated, the problem is this: I don't know what to do with her car. 

&#x200B;

\* Carvana was willing to give her $2000 trade in value ($1500 purchase +$500 credit if buying with Carvana). 

&#x200B;

Option 1: Sell her car to Carvana to avoid the hassle, move her here without a car, purchase a CPO in my city (looking like 7-8% APR in my city for 72 months)

&#x200B;

Option 2: Buy from Carvana, refinance later on

&#x200B;

Option 3: ???

&#x200B;

Any suggestions here? Someone told me it's possible to trade in your car for credit on a purchase in a different location. Others told me to try long distance towing it here to use for trade in or sell privately. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, I'm lost - I've never dealt with any situations similar to this and would appreciate any guidance/ideas you have to offer.

With my history, I know that I need to make a change to make this car last for at least 6 years ideally.  
While looking for a car, I have been using a rental and in this time I have been curbing some of my bad habits ( not speeding as much, not flooring the gas pedal, leaving more space in between cars,etc.) 
Now here‚Äôs the question, I am obviously trying to change for myself but if I do find myself speeding, do I just slow down immediately? How do I set myself up to not speed and drive like a normal human?

For the last 6 years I NEVER felt the inclination to go back home, see my family but a medical emergency sort of forced me to fly back for 7 weeks. 
For the 6 years that I spent here, I realised I had sort of deluded myself into thinking this is home while struggling to find work, manage my health issues and constantly crunching numbers in my head to pay bills/rent/ extend visas etc. 
Then when I actually stepped in my parents home and lived there for 7 weeks I realised what home was actually supposed to feel like. For the first time in a very long time I was in the presence of people who loved me and cared about my well-being. I had forgotten what it was like hold my father's hand and cuddle with my mother.

72,Life after au pairing,11s7z2i,"I‚Äôm 27 years old and just finishing 2 years of au pairing in the US. I am about to return to my home country and my family and it‚Äôs eating me up on the inside. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my family. My home country is safe, I can live a stable life there, I could technically return to my previous job as a flight attendant that I lost during the pandemic‚Ä¶ but I feel like I‚Äôm not the same person that left my country 2 years ago. 

I come from a family of very kind, but small minded people. They don‚Äôt leave their comfort zone. They live in their small little bubble and that is how they‚Äôre comfortable. On the countryside, nobody moved further away than maybe a 20 min drive. 
And I don‚Äôt blame them, it‚Äôs totally fine to be content with that. It just doesn‚Äôt work for ME. 

Unfortunately, they‚Äôre having big trouble making peace with the fact that I want to live my life differently. When I first left my country, they tried everything in their power to hold me back. 

After I lost my job during the pandemic, I started making plans to go to the US to be an au pair. Even though I had already found a host family and was in the process of obtaining my visa, my mom would make suggestions of local jobs to apply for. It was so irritating, sometimes I even felt gaslit. Like, I‚Äôm about to pack my bags and get on the plane, what do you mean ‚Äúapply for this job as a waitress‚Äù?? Did you not hear what I‚Äôve been telling you for months?? 

When I finally made it here, I was happy and I felt free to reinvent myself, develop new parts of my identity without feeling judged. I started wearing more extravagant things, voice my opinion, working out, explore my interests, even ran a marathon. 
But I also felt incredibly guilty for hurting my family‚Äôs feelings and putting my own interest first.  But still, I‚Äôve never felt so free and happy to be my true authentic self. I realized I want to go back to school and get a degree - I didn‚Äôt go to college, but I really want to make up for that now and get my education right.  

Now, I have applied for a school in the US and got in. All I have to do is apply for a student visa in my home country and if everything works out, I may come back to study. But I can already see my family‚Äôs reaction. Again, downplaying my decision and goals. Telling me ‚Äúcome home for now, then we can see what‚Äôs next‚Äù 
I already know what‚Äôs next!!

I feel so uncomfortable going back home because being physically there, I know their opinion is going to affect me even more. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll lose parts of my identity that I have found within the past two years to an outdated version of myself. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll lose my growth and progress.  But mostly, I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll lose my mind‚Ä¶ from NYC back to the country side. Getting a student visa will take a little while.

80,How do I accept having to work?,11smoqb,"Hello, I turned 18 a few months ago and I'm a first year vet nursing student. I'm burnt out on my 3 weeks after starting, feeling incredibly stressed. Part of it is the thought of doing one job, 40 hours a week, every week, for possibly YEARS. I get panic attacks thinking about having to work, especially in my chosen field of vet nursing. The thought of likely working from as early as 8am to late as 6pm every weekday, I'm crying now as I think about it. Especially a job that deals with long hours, death/ill health, etc. How am I ever supposed to have a life outside of working? I have a boyfriend I've been with over a year and I love him a lot - I'm not sure how I could cope with the hours an hours of lost time per week only to make minimum wage. I can't express myself with clothes, nails, hair etc. The thought of doing that in my 20s and just losing so much time by that freaks me out a lot. I want time time my boyfriend, my family, myself. People always say time seems to go faster as they grow older but I theorize it's because you are spending so many more hours working that blur together. What if I waste my youth working a job so stressful and intense? Right now, a month feels like a long time. A year is a really really long time. Multiple years feels like it would drive me insane.

I'm a creative person. I play guitar, crochet, paint and draw. So it was even a surprise to myself when I chose a scientific study. I would absolutely love to work creatively, but I know industries are harsh and I'm self conscious about my work. Thouhh working on my own terms would be incredible- because when will I ever have time to do those things I love? Recently I had a weekend of work experience, I did two 8 hour days in a row after my 4 days of classes that week. After the first day I was so exhausted I couldn't leave the couch for over an hour. The second was no different and I was counting down the minutes until I could go home. Only I absolutely loved work experience, it was cleaning and working with sick animals to feed/monitor their health. That was only two days in a row and I felt like the one thing letting me finish those 16 hours was the fact that I got a free day after. Everywhere I want to go is closed after work and sometimes it's already dark outside when I'm going home. If I'm working 8 hours with an hour lunch between, that's waking up at 7, work from 8-5, commute and dinner until 6:30, then I've got maybe 3 hours to see the people in my life before it starts over. How the hell will I be able to do that when I'm feeling miserable after 3 weeks of studying full time (20~ hours a week)??? I'm fucking doomed. I'm going to die broke, alone, grey haired at 20. This can't just be my life. 

I've started getting genuinely angry whenever I open my phone. Seeing 'influencers' who's job is going to a party or putting on an outfit, turning their phone sideways and posing to make 5 figures a month. People genuinely enjoying their lives and having time to renovate a house or upcycle thrifted dresses or foster animals or spend time with their loved ones. Animators, seamstresses, models who get to showcase their talents and make something incredible that people love and want to see. My father has a 'non traditional' job, hes been a musician usually playing at weddings and other events since a teen, I've seen how much he works and how much he absolutely adores it. Be never formally studied. He's always practicing his instrument, learning new songs, travelling all over the country. How do I get around accepting my life will be this repetitive, emotionally draining cycle? I won't even have the time of day nor the money to visit a therapist?

I live in a two bed one bath apt close to my school's campus. The rent is cheap for the area and the location is fantastic, which is why I have stayed. That is where the positives end. My roommate is so weird and rude (being intentionally vague here but just trust me it's bad). I only agreed to move in in the first place due to the reasons above and because they lied about a bunch of things when I met with them beforehand. 

Yes, I have done all the things like confronting about behaviors, texting them when something is wrong etc etc, most with no success. Basically, I am ready to vanish as soon as a graduate with my BS in May.

As someone with little experience renting, I want to know if I can do this without running into any legal trouble. I can't afford a lawyer to read over this and tell me so I am hoping that someone here has experienced this before or has some advice they can give me. 

There are three names on the lease, mine, my roommates, and the old guy who I replaced. The lease is done on July 31st. I would stay after I grad but without the structure and escape of school, I *will* go insane.

Can I move out with no notice to my roommate since we are all considered ""equal"" on the lease? By ""equal"" I mean that when the guy I replaced moved out, I was just added to the lease like I had been there the whole time. I guess this would make all three of us liable for paying the rent and the rental company wouldn't care who it comes from because we are not on separate leases from one another. I can provide a photo of the ""tenant intent to vacate"" instructions if that's of any help.

I'm not too concerned with being an asshole, more that he will try and sue me. I would offer to just give him the rent upfront but that would be upwards of $1400 that I could use to get a new place, get a new car etc. I am no longer liable or bound by this lease come July 31st. 

I am more than happy to answer any clarifying questions, provide specific language in the ""intent to vacate"" form, or anything else, thanks in advance. I will also gladly listen to (read) any other advice pertaining to this!

90,No credit and too chill about money,11sav3a,"Hi! I (26F) moved to the US four years ago, married. It's been going well financially: we are not from rich families and are financially independent anyway, but we consistently have a few thousand in checking, manage rent in Boston, have savings and some investments. I am about to start a Master's with a full assistantship (waiver and stipend) We don't budget, but with our 1.5 jobs and modest-by-nature lifestyle it still works out for comfortable life, saving, and bigger purchases if needed. 

This kind of relationship with money makes me feel a little estranged from the general discourse and anxious about not being anxious. What am I missing? I honestly feel like a simpleton who will regret this? The attitude I grew up with, work and get paid. Buy what you have the means for, put away for the future but live now. So, we have no credit, never had or needed a credit card. There's so much talk about credit, but boy am I unwilling to get one. It feels like it will be transactions for the sake of transactions: we just don't need to borrow, why would I use stranger money if I have mine, and create a debt out of nothing monthly? I just honestly don't understand the notion of ""credit"", especially not growing up here. In addition, I'm a somewhat disorganized person with a brain that discards anything deemed ""superficial"" and gets anxious easily, so I absolutely do not trust myself with paying off balance I created for nothing on time, and I will feel nervous about participating in something I don't really understand. I am, to put it nicely, very money-simple and basic financial maneuvers (cashbacks, tax considerations, crypto etc) make my brain go -blank-. My spouse is smarter in this regard (he's the one who keeps investments), but I'm the one who initiates ""projects"" and manages them, a ""doer"", so it'll likely be in me to get it going.

94,Feeling like I'll be Forever Tied to a Car Loan,11s6c36,"I'm 31 and live in Houston, the outskirts rather, and the suburbs and the city really have me feeling that there's no convenient way to get around without a car. I'm coming to question whether or not I need a car...how established adults get by with constantly financing (or perhaps they buy cheap/outright purchase a car), and whether or not I want to move to a city that is less car-centric and has great public transportation. At the same time, I love the freedom that I feel in able to drive anywhere.

Some background, I got my first car at 23, spent 5 years paying it off, only for it to give me severe issues by the 5th year. I paid it off, and it wasn't worth much by the end with transmission issues. Adding on to this, i was early in my career, making very little in the administrative sector and my car was always a severe source of anxiety due to repair costs. I was never filling my car up etc. Money was tight.

I'm doing better now financially although, I'm still financing a car and won't have it paid off for maybe 4 more years. My first car and the anxiety it gave me (constantly breaking down)  has made me overly cautious in regards to maintenance. I was younger then, out of school, and a bit reckless. I was treating my economy car like trash and driving absolutely everywhere. I'm more careful now.

I guess I'm worried that I'll forever be tied to a loan. I'm very intimidated by car issues and I feel like I'm being taken advantage of at repair shops all the time. It all sounds like gibberish to me hahah. It's gotten to the point where I'm considering in 5 years or so...moving a to a city that's somewhat affordable but also very great with public transportation...although in a sense, it would be an incredible lifestyle change. At the moment, in Houston, I feel that I have to drive absolutely everywhere. Whether it's the gym for a 10 min drive, or a grocery store...I feel that my car is making these things convenient. I mean...having to bike everywhere doesn't sound like fun either but the costs to finance, pay for insurance, any repairs, and safety/inspection costs, definitley add up. Ideally, I think I'd love to get to a place where I'm using public transportation 80% of the time, and using my car for other tasks.


I guess I'm wanting to get advice from others late into their careers or older adults on whether they've completely changed their lifestyles, or to those that still purchase and how they go about it.",Jaded_Community723,4,1,1.0

I‚Äôve had a few hurdles in the last year really knock me down. My father the only family member I truly loved passed away during December 2022 the day before my 25th birthday. I hadn‚Äôt imagined I‚Äôd be spending it registering his death and trying to sort legal issues with his ex wife (legally still married but separated for 16 years) immediately contesting his will. I also went no contact with my sister and reported her for identity theft. I was bombarded with harassment from family for months. 

I‚Äôve started 2023 with no savings and a sense of feeling truly alone in this world.Some days I feel confident and productive however others I genuinely can only hear a negative voice in my head telling me I‚Äôm worthless.I‚Äôve always been someone who struggles to regulate my emotions and cries when I get defensive. My quality of work declined rapidly as of late and I was reprimanded at work.I broke down and just cried like a baby which was very unprofessional. I‚Äôm so tired of being the victim but that‚Äôs all I feel like.

I feel like I‚Äôm getting too old to be having these emotional outbursts constantly. However I genuinely don‚Äôt know how to grow up.I escaped an abusive home about 1.5 yrs ago. I‚Äôve never felt like a real adult. My mother treated me like I was incompetent and redid everything I ever did in the home. She held my hand crossing streets and cut my food till I was in my late teens ffs.I felt like I was punished for having independent thoughts. I was completely broken for years. 

Yes I have a job (low pay) but I‚Äôm not independent and can‚Äôt provide for myself. I‚Äôm one wrong move away from messing up at work and having to move back in with my mum if I can‚Äôt financially support myself.I feel like an imposter. I feel like I‚Äôm not as mature as I‚Äôd like and I need to grow up despite want desperately to cling to my youth.I would like to get back into therapy not really sure what type would be best. So far I‚Äôve tried CBT, Group Therapy, Talking therapies and counselling. 

I did contact my local healthcare provider and they referred me for talking therapies who said they felt like they couldn‚Äôt offer me the support I needed. They were willing to refer me to various charities for specific issues with limited sessions. I frankly had enough being passed around and told them I wasn‚Äôt interested. I plan on going private once my savings have built back up but till then I need to find a way to cope independently.

129,Why are adult friends high-maintenance??,11paicw,"I find that if I dont reply within a certain timeframe to my friends (despite the effort I may have put into my paragraph long reply), I still get the cold shoulder reply back and I can tell they are pissed that it took me a while to reply back. Why is it like this?? I dont do it on purpose, i just have a really hectic schedule so I try my best to reply when I can and I dont like to reply when I am in-between things. I am also not glued to my phone and I don't want to be. But my friends don't seem to understand that idea.

Life is complex and its busy and its messy and its confusing. Surely as adults I would think we would understand this.

EDIT: Wow I didn‚Äôt think this would get a lot of attention but it seems like a pretty popular topic so thanks everyone for all the responses!

To those asking my timeline would be 1-2 days. I have some friends who also take a day to reply and that works out fine. But I have others who reply legit within like 1 min and so when I take 6-7hrs I still get a reply but its usually a cold one (you can tell after you have been friends for someone for a while).

I am not a shitty friend or anything (at least I don‚Äôt think I am). I make the time and effort in other ways beyond texting. I initiate hangouts and meet up with people (sometimes even commute for over an hour just to hang out), I make birthdays and special events a priority etc. I guess the one area I suck at is replying back to people quickly but that seems to be the one that stings people the most if I don‚Äôt do it right.

Obviously after reading this people are on two different sides of this debate. But I think what I learned from this was:

1. I need to communicate better and set expectations better and if I don‚Äôt then that makes me the shitty friend.
2. I should set up ‚Äútexting‚Äù blocks during the day so I don‚Äôt forget to reply
3. Emotional needs do have a timeline (which makes sense) so if someone needs me now, then me responding a day later isn‚Äôt really going to count for anything.
4. Might just have to find friends who are more similar to me in communication style or life style.

EDIT #2: When I say i take 1-2 days to reply I am obviously not talking about replying to a ""how you doing"" after 2 days. I mean in general for each of my friends when we're in a middle of a convo the min amount each person sends is around 6-7 messages in one go. and then factor in the idea that I keep in touch with all my friend so thats around 8-9 people. so yes doing that on a daily and you can maybe see why i would need at least a day to reply to everyone. and on days that are super overwhelming, more than a day.

As much as I hated it, I kinda made peace with it not being a big possibility in my life.  Now me and my sister have been talking. She's ready to move out and we talked about the both of us renting an apartment together which we could def do.  Moving out would give me the ability to be even more independent. I'd finally be able to have a car because where I live now there's no room for me to have one. There is virtually nothing but positives in my regard. But I'm still terrified for a few reasons as well. One, if I'm on my own im truly on my own everything that goes on is literally my problem. I'd have to leave my pets which would be so insanely difficult for me as I love them so much. I'm also kinda concerned for the mental health of the parent I live with.

151,How long does it normally take to move on from a previous job?,11pdz6r,"I've posted here quite a bit about this but I almost feel like I got closure this morning.  Basically, I worked at a fast food place from age 23-31 and worked my way up from the porter to the general manager. I was technically the acting general manager because I was only paid $15/hr, not the $55,000/ year salary that GMs make. From the summer of 2021 until July of 2022, I basically ran the store myself because the old GM became lazy and had an attitude toward everything. It was hell but I stuck with it because I wanted to see the place succeed. The old GM quit in July of 2022 and I temporarily took over for the next two months. But for those two months, I received no help from the district manager. We had no manager coverage so it was myself and one other manager covering 7 days and I was working 16-18 hour days but couldn't get paid overtime so like half of my days were off the clock. There was never any clear indicator of whether or not there was any intention of making me the GM or not. After seeing no progress or effort made from the district manager for two months, I just stopped showing up in September. After 8.5 years of no call offs or anything, I just didn't show up after a 20 hour day where I would have gotten literally a four hour break between shifts, and the DM just contacts me to say to turn in my keys or she'll call the police. No asking what was wrong or anything, just that I was done. I know I was wrong and at the time, I wanted to quit because I had had no break the entire time of working there. No vacation time was ever granted to me. At 31, I got to watch all these far more successful people take vacations and live their lives while I was committed to a fast food restaurant. 


But yet every day since quitting, I've regretted it. I was really good at my job. I kept the store staffed, the crew and managers happy, the store was the cleanest in the district and we literally had compliments from health inspectors and exterminators about how clean the place was, which I was proud of because I did all the cleaning myself. But all of this didn't seem to match the goals of the DM. Her style is more of jumping from crisis to crisis so she can bail them out and look like the hero. And if there wasn't a problem, she'd create one. When I quit, I was just so tired, mentally and physically, and needed a break. I still feel like I can't mentally handle it anymore. 


My former coworker texted me yesterday and told me they finally found a general manager to take over the store. It took them this long and it's a girl who I had promoted but she turned out to be a terrible manager. She couldn't do anything but be a body for a shift and it was a struggle even getting her to show up. Sometimes she'd show up with her baby and we got complaints of her carrying her baby around the store while working. It just proves how some people only get their titles by being in the right place at the right time, and not by working for it necessarily. 
But at the same time, I feel like such a failure because I still can't bring myself to move on. All I've been doing is working a remote job, making the same $15/hr for 30-35 hours a week and trying to figure out what kind of degree or schooling I'm decent in. I've gotten certificates in coding, digital marketing, and I'm waiting to take the proctored HVAC certification currently. But at the same time, I feel like I'm not ready to put myself out there to work in person yet. I leave the house maybe once a month. I haven't driven my car since September. I just want to hide away while I get myself sorted out but I'm constantly reminded of how if I had stayed at my old job, I wouldn't be in this situation. I'd still be just as unhappy though. 


Mentally, I feel like I can't handle anything anymore. Most days I'm stuck in such a fog that I can't focus on anything and the day flies by without me being able to recollect even one thing I did. I've been told to talk to a therapist so many times and I want to but at the same time I feel like maybe my problems aren't big enough to warrant a therapist. That maybe I'm just lazy and stupid and unable to face the reality that my old job was never going to be what I wanted it to be.",aunttjemima,4,2,1.0

Is it normal/are you meant to put the bins on the street next to the curb rather than on the sidewalk edge/on the curb (sidewalk level but at the edge)?

When I did live in a house and took the bins out, we left them on the curb, not on the street. Putting them on the street blocks parking so the curb or sidewalk edge is where we put them... but I just moved, and even though the bins are fully accessible and visible, if they aren't on the street the garbage and recycling trucks will ignore them.

But there's not really anywhere on the street to place them since cars are parked or ot would block a driveway. There are almost always cars parked there, and there is a driveway right next to where the bins are, we can't block it with the bins though 

When cars are parked and only the driveway is available, we can't put the bins on the street. They won't collect our trash when this happens. We've gone weeks without trash collection which causes us to have an overflowing bin with pile by it

I started to look in the supermarkets sites (Walmart, Costco) to try to get a ideia of how much everything cost, but I saw that the prices on site is different from the prices on store, so I got more confused 

I'm worried about my budget for food because everybody says ""cook your own food and freeze it"" but I will be living in a dorm where there is two fridges for 20 people, so i dont think i can do that...

Struggling with euthanizing .. again 

So I either posted here or a different subreddit back in the fall. I had to put my furry soul mate of almost 14 year down. It was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. 

My other dog that I adopted a few years ago extremely bonded with him, since his passing she's kind of giving up on living. She is almost 11 years old and developing cancer. 

Some days she's still a puppy, other day she's hardly functioning. I have come to the decision to put her down as well, but I feel so guilty. 

It's so hard to lose to Companions one after the other, but I don't have it in me to watch another dog deteriorate.

And I. Can not accept this kindness without reciprocating in some way.
I just can't take it if I'm not doing something for them.

I'm planning to give them both gas money in cash at the end of the month (just before we get paid bc we get paid once a month).

However, it does. This colleagues frequently wanders away from her desk, for 10-15 minutes at a time. 
My workplace operates a bit like a call center, and we're each tasked to look after a certain area.
If a call goes to one area, and it isn't answered it will bounce to the available staff member.
This means if she isn't at her desk, her calls will not only bounce to me, but be directed to me by other coordinators, and the  concerns need to be followed up by me, and this then increases my workload.

This colleagues isn't mean, just extroverted, and based on her behaviour a bit inconsiderate.

My goal is not to monitor anyone. 
However, if someone is being irresponbile, and expecting their colleagues to pick up the tab. At some point the situation needs to be handeled.

She doesn't inform people, if she's on her break or not, so I just assume she is, but she could be on break for far longer (in total), then authorized.
I could end up doing someone else's work for longer than needed. I understand being a part of a team means helping others out, but her behavior isn't team-oriented. Unfortunately, I deal with a lot of fragile egos, meaning criticism isn't taken well.

My current approach is to assist with one or two calls when she's away, and then inform incoming calls to hold for the staff member and/or leave a VM and/or call back within 10-15 minutes and/or leave a task for her to follow up on her areas matters.

175,"How do you deal with ""stingy"" adult friends?",11n8g3b,"I'm the type of person who, if you're my friend, I'm more than happy to spot you a lunch or buy you a beer.

That's what I do with my one friend, who also happens to be my main snowboarding partner. More often than not, I'll buy him a beer at whichever resort we're at, but he won't reciprocate it. I guess every once in awhile he does, but not often.

I'm not much of a record keeper, but after a certain amount of time, this trend can't be ignored. I'm generous and enjoy showing my appreciation to the close people in my life. But if someone never reciprocates, it becomes harder for me to do it with a happy heart. And it's not like he's poor. We're in the same line of work and make similar money.

And the real kicker is: I don't actually care that much, from a financial perspective. It's more the principle that gets me.

I've been a bit resentful lately. I guess I should just stop buying him beers, food, etc, huh? Has anybody had to deal with this sort of thing?

EDIT1: thanks for the thoughtful feedback so far. But there‚Äôs a trend with some of the replies I want to nip in the bud -
It‚Äôs absolutely not a financial strain on me to spot my buddy a beer or food. That‚Äôs not the point. I enjoy gifting, but at a certain point one can feel taken advantage of.

203,How to change ways for good,11mtlhw,"I keep messing up ever having gone through something that should‚Äôve changed my ways. I (22M) have a real problem when it comes to speeding while driving. I‚Äôm often careless and give into peer pressure to speed by others. 

For some context, this morning, I was running a little late and due to this I sped out of my driveway on my way to class. I see my neighbor outside with her dog so I wave, taking my eyes off the road. Now thankfully there were no kids around (I wouldn‚Äôt have sped if there were), but nonetheless eyes off road, and high rate of speed. She waved back but when I look forward, I am heading into a snow bank and almost knocked out the neighbors mailbox. I drove to school and am now in the parking lot. 

A few minutes ago I received a phone call from my parents because the neighbor texted them what had happened and to say that I‚Äôm embarrassed is a major understatement.  

Now last October I hit a curb everting a parking lot, thankfully no one got hurt but my car was damaged. I promised I wouldn‚Äôt speed because repairs are expensive, etc. it worked, maybe for the next 3 days and after that I was back to my old ways again. 

Now here‚Äôs why, amongst, other reasons why I should change. I was in a hit and run with a presumed drunk driver about 2 weeks ago. Thankfully I‚Äôm ok, but my car was totaled and most importantly I could‚Äôve been killed. I was given a second chance but evidently I haven‚Äôt learned anything or I would drive more carefully.

206,24 and still asking permission,11ls9xm,"I want to fly to Florida for my birthday. I live in a cold place and really want to see the beach. I have the money... I just can't get an OK from my parents. They say it's too dangerous to go alone as a girl. I have no friends to go with. So will I never go then? I dream of Miami but I guess I can never go unless with a chaperone. I can't walk in my neighborhood without asking my mom and she gets someone to go with me. I never take the bus and I spend most days at home. We mostly talk about my mom's everyday issues with my grandma who has memory issues. I can't find a job and I am scared of driving. I am like a goldfish in a bowl: well fed, happy most days, but feeling empty and bored. My mom takes me to Target, Marshall's and TJmaxx as an outing. I don't feel like buying clothes because I never have an opportunity to wear them. She picks them out for me anyway. The last time I looked in my closet I realized it was all clothes she bought for me..none that I have chosen. When I choose something myself she'll say, ""don't you have something like that already?"" And proceed to pick something she likes for me.. sometimes I feel like screaming because she seems to be able to look into the future and knows which step I take will result in a mistake. Do it this way, not this way.. everything I do is in some way wrong.. I feel like a failure. My parents tell me not to become like my aunt who was babied by her parents, and now stays home all the time and never got married. But I feel like they see that for me because of my fear of driving, not that there's so much to miss living in a suburban town, but at least I could hop from parking lot to parking lot. I feel like a burden to the few friends that I have because I can't drive. But they don't ever have big plans to go anywhere because they are strictly religious. Sometimes I think that's an excuse, maybe it's just outside their comfort zone. I feel bad asking to come along anyway... I can count on my hands how many times I've been out since turning 21. Now it's going to be my 25th birthday. I feel like I've barely been an adult. My friends are in school for law and medicine but I haven't been able to find work after school. I have been to networking events and got over 30 contacts and emailed them all but no one apparently knows of any opportunities. I hate asking. I hate being the one begging. I am on 3 different dating apps and am always the first to message with few replies, and in cases where the guy replies the conversation goes nowhere. As soon as they find out they have to drive to meet me they lose interest. They want me to deliver myself to them. There has not been one to suggest meeting halfway. I'm almost 25 and never had a boyfriend. It's my most sincere wish..but meeting someone would require freedom. Again, I'm begging. I'm the one asking for a favor. To live. To love. To make my own choices. But I'm going nowhere fast...and as they say, repeating something over and over and getting the same result is insanity...I think I'm going crazy.

211,Scary Information Received by Landlord - Please Help,11me0hh,"I have been at my current apartment¬†for the past 2 years and my building is rent stabilized (my unit is not).

My lease was expiring this past February¬†13th and starting January 9th we started reaching out to my landlord expressing how we'd like to renew our lease. We didn't¬†hear from them so we proceeded to call and send multiple¬†emails following up with our landlord to sign¬†the lease, also reaching out via our super. We did everything we could to express we would like to renew.¬†

It wasn't until this Thursday that my girlfriend decided to call our landlord 4 times in a row leaving multiple voicemails that our landlord finally called us back on a random number notifying us that the building would like to renovate¬†our unit (which makes no sense - will explain more in the next paragraph). He said that we have 2 options because of this, either going month by month at the same rate with the caveat¬†that he can give us 60-day notice at any time that we need to find a new place. The other¬†option is we sign a year lease at an increased rate that he can't¬†tell us yet with the same caveat that he will have the option of enacting a¬†60-day notice of eviction clause.¬†

This makes no sense to us because our unit was renovated 1 year prior to us moving in. We pay rent on time and have made sure to build a good relationship with all our neighbors to be as much of a model tenant as possible. We love our building and do not want to move, but I am so confused about what's happening and don't know what to do.¬†

After speaking with my next-door neighbor (another tenant who is not rent stabilized) he let me know they are doing month-by-month with them, but they didn't¬†tell them the reason why. They think it's great that rent hasn't¬†gone up but we knew something was wrong.

I believe they are trying to push out the entire building and they just have control over the renovated¬†units. They let us know the worst-case scenario is that we'll be evicted in 6 months as they are trying to broker a deal with the landlord, which makes me believe my landlord runs a few units in our building and someone¬†else runs the rest.¬†

How early should we start hunting for apartments? I've been told to wait for Moving Day (July 1st for us) is that appropriate?

What are some ""red flags"" that we should be aware of?

Should we aim for certain ""included"" services? Like internet, fridges, ovens, etc?

We've been looking at 1 1/2 apartments, is that realistic to live as a couple?

How much money should we have saved before getting an apartment?

In my instance, I had a work ""friend"" for 3.5 years. We've hung out outside of work, our kids knew us, etc. We've never disagreed on anything. When my family FINALLY moved out of my MIL's and into our own place, she was super stoked for us. We were chatting back and forth a bunch. As soon as I invited her and her kids over, she GHOSTED ME! I mean, she COMPLETELY stopped responding to me on all social media. After 3 months of seeing her be consistent on social media and never messaging me back, I finally removed her from all platforms. I still don't get it! I even asked her to just tell me if I did something wrong, and nothing.

Now my husband started at his job 2 years ago and said he wanted to stick it out 2 years and get a government job. He became ""close friends"" with a coworker- they have gone frisbee golfing together every day after work, on the weekends, bbq'd and hung out with him and his wife who I became friends with.

239,"How do I write management skills on a resume when I am not, in fact, a manager?",11ld6t3,"Starting about six months ago I often found myself in the position where my senior colleagues were all WFH on the same day, so the part time, casual and new staff would automatically come to me for instructions and help. (That is a really weird feeling only six months into your working life, btw, I've been st this job just over a year now.) We recently had a crisis where, because I was the most senior person on site, I was basically the one running around putting out fires and touching base with people and kicking a few backsides. It's healthcare so when crises happen we cannot just sit back and wait for someone else to fix it.

It's only been six months but I figure I should stick it on the resume since I have yet to actually profit from this extra responsibility. I'm in this situation at least one day a week but could be up to three days a week before I had to cut back my hours, so it was not a rare thing. 

I don't really know how to write it, though. Usually I write it in my cover letters as (skill) - (explanation of skill). So what I'd normally write is something along the lines of:

> **Management** - Trained new colleagues, provided guidance and instructions to colleagues, took initiative to manage crisis situations through communication with other departments (etc) 

But obviously I'm not comfortable actually putting it down AS management as 1) I am not a manager and 2) being left in charge isn't the same as having the same responsibilities my actual managers do. Absolutely don't want to convey the wrong idea.

240,"Women of Reddit, how do you balance an education, relationship, family, and career?",11l7xqq,"I just graduated with my BA in psychology at 24. Here are my goals:
1. Get into a top MA in art therapy program.
2. Move in with my partner. 
3. Complete gradschool (2-3 years)
4. Get married. 
5. Buy a home.
6. Have a family.

I am so confused. Here are some questions I have:
1. How do you decide which gradschools to go to, given you have a partner and now need to consider things like proximity to both of our families/if your partner actually would want to live there?
2. After how many years of dating do you move in together? We've been dating for under a year. I know it's really soon to be thinking about this stuff but we both know we want this and have talked about it. Both of us want to get married and have a family eventually. I probably want to live with him throughout gradschool, but there's this awkward year period while I apply...my lease ends in September and applications are due for most of the programs in November. Should we move in together before we have to pick up and move to my gradschool? He works remotely so at least I don't need to consider his education. 
3. Do you wait until you're done with gradschool to get married? I'm 24 now, I'll probably be like 28-29 when I graduate. 
4. That's a quick turnaround to have a baby before all my eggs die (35 max) and I'm infertile...ugh. so stressful. I feel so behind the game. I also have PCOS so I already am at a disadvantage. Should I get my eggs frozen?
5. Okay, so I have a baby, well...now I can't work for like 2-3 years! Why did I even get a MA degree then?! Will my art therapy licensure expire? Will I have to redo my credit hours?
6. How am I supposed to save up enough to have a home when everything is so damn expensive. I have like $1000 in my bank account. I'm also living in an extremely expensive area so getting out of here is a priority. I'm taking on a second job to start saving though and really cutting back on all unnecessary expenses like coffee, eating out, clothing, etc.

For example I'm currently getting my drivers licence (a few years late) because theres no way I could sit through the 120 hours of driving you need to do with a licenced driver with him. He just makes me wayyyyy too anxious which screws me up, even after all my hours. It doesn't help that the rest of my family sees me as a kid who can't do anything right (even my little sister, who can do ""adulting"" things better then I can even though she left school in like grade 8, in fact I'm the only one in my immediate family who has actually graduated highschool).

Anyway I feel the same about cooking with him, he thinks i'm way too slow at doing everything and that I always do everything wrong (even though I still think the result tastes fine enough, but I'm known to eat almost anything). Which makes me not want to do it. 

I'd much rather just figure it out on my own (although I do have bits and pieces of knowledge, I did have cooking classes in years 7-8 but we were in pairs and I wasn't good at cooking so for both our grades sake i'd always just do the dishes, and that was a long time ago. There have also been other attempts to teach me but I have never had to repeat them so they never stuck.

My dad has to work nightshift today so todays as good a day as any where he won't get angry about the duplicated work.

EDIT: Figured i'd make an update, I ended up having fried rice (without eggs, turns out they were expired, but whatever). My sister ended up helping me because she didn't trust me to not burn down the building lol. Well it turns out she didn't actually know how to make fried rice. So I was following along with a recipe online. When it came to do the rice (I did other stuff first) I asked my sisters bf how I clean rice (which I had heard your meant to). He had no idea what I was talking about so he told me how HE does it, so I ended up following how he does it. Then in the middle of that my dad calls me to check up on me and I told him I was making fried rice, he asked how I was doing it and then he mentioned another entirely different way of doing it so I went to that instead.

In the end it was embarrassing (every different person thought I was dumb lol), and in the end I'm still not sure if I actually cooked it correctly due to all the conflicting information and it doesn't taste quite right. But at least in the end I think I've made something that's meant to be edible (if not it's drowned in enough sauce that I don't care) and I managed to not burn down the building which I guess is the important part.",Sol33t303,30,12,0.94

Also, I've been at home since COVID hit when I was 19 in college so since then everything has been remote (both schooling and work) and I live with my parents in the suburbs so there aren't many options.

I never felt that I was lacking though. I think I learned a lot from relationships from hearing stories from my friends and seeing their interactions from an objective 3rd POV. I also learned a lot about what I want from relationships from movies, books, TV shows, etc so in a sense I do feel like I have experience. 

I do have a high sense of worth and value even though I never have gotten romantic attraction. I am happy with how I look and often get compliments for my appearance. I also am intelligent and have graduated top 10% of my class so I know I have value even if I have never been in my relationship. I have a strong sense of self and have built my confidence over the year. 

I am worried that people would not want to give me a chance since I am so inexperienced at my age. I was wondering if this has caused issues later on in life for people? I'm worried people well see me as immature or will think something is wrong with me. Do I be open about this once I start dating? And where can I meet people when there aren't many people my age around me? I'd appreciate any advice you have :)",sunflowury,26,12,0.73

273,Entry level jobs that pay decently well with good work/life balance?,11jhdb8,"
Hi everyone I‚Äôm 22F and have been graduated for a year and have left roles in under a year. I had ZERO training, no work/life balance, completely remote, managers that wouldn‚Äôt show up to calls/1:1‚Äôs, etc.

I want a job that is kinda boring but easy and isn‚Äôt stressful. I‚Äôve had internships where I did stuff like data entry or excel and honestly didn‚Äôt mind it. I just want to get trained on how to do things.

Im good at figuring stuff out on my own but it‚Äôs difficult when you get no training at all and are not shown how to do anything. I realized I cannot work 12 hour days anymore. I‚Äôm a hard worker but dedicating my life to a job that doesn‚Äôt value me and I‚Äôm not interested in I just can do it for that long. 

I realized I‚Äôll never get happiness for a career so I want a job that will at least bring me peace. I just want to go to work, know what I‚Äôm doing, do it, leave, and pay my bills. 

Any suggestions on roles/industries/companies etc? I‚Äôd appreciate any help I feel so so so lost and like a failure.",Major-Hippo-336,12,5,0.78
274,"Evicted 06/22 for no cause from mtm lease. Living with parents in ""makeshift"" bedroom. Planning on taking 2 jobs to get out ASAP. Need guidance/advice on plans.",11jkr8u,"Hey everyone,

I'm 28 / M. I got kicked out of my house I'd been renting for 4 years back in June of 2022, was never late on bills or rent. The owner was planning to increase the rent for the place and was not able to legally raise it as high as they wanted with me on a current agreement with them. So they decided to give me a 30 day notice to vacate, (year lease had ended, we were on month to month) and I had no recourse legally to keep my home.

I was only making about $20/hr working full time to cover all my bills and also cover the expenses of my fiancee, who is currently NEET but due to medical/mental health issues. We have no children. We lived somewhat comfortably, but still paycheck to paycheck, no money in savings or for emergencies. 

I was unable to find another place to move into within 30 days, and had absolutely no alternatives other than moving 2+ hours away to move into my mother's house with my younger siblings and her new husband. 

There was no room here for us to live in, so we had to makeshift a room with curtains and a cardboard wall to give us some semblance of privacy. Our ""room"" is currently a curtained off 12ft x 8ft area in the basement level ""living room"" which is essentially a wide hallway before leading to a corridor down to my mother's room and my little sisters room.

The plan was to be here for only a few months, while I continued looking for a new place to move in to. I worked remotely, so relocating didn't affect my job at all. However, we were unable to find any decent places within our budget in the first couple months of being here. 

Then, I got hit by the tech layoffs starting last fall, and was laid off in October. This was obviously bad, but at the very least we weren't worrying about becoming homeless. I'm extremely grateful for being offered a space in my mother's home to get back on my feet, but this made us realize we would be in this situation for far longer than we anticipated. 

I started looking for a new job immediately but the market was awful. Constantly getting rejected for every job I applied for. I was eligible for unemployment from OCT-JAN but I would not be able to find a place to move into as no one would want to rent to someone on UE with an unstable income. So I've now been here since 06/22. 8 months now. 

Being in this situation has put a lot of stress on my fiancee, and our relationship to an extent. Neither of us has really felt too comfortable having a sex life here, since we don't have an actual room. So our intimacy has been heavily restricted. We have only really made just enough to get by from unemployment while I tried to find a new job, and tons of things went wrong during this time. (Car accident, health issues, etc)

I finally got a job offer at the beginning of Feb, offering $30/hr - fully remote. I just started this job on 02/20. However I wasn't sure I'd actually be starting this job or not due to some sketchy things that happened during background check and onboarding that made me concerned about this possibly being a scam. So I continued talking to another company that had reached out to me about an offer as well. 

After starting with Job1($30/hr), I was offered another job with Job2 for $25/hr (also fully remote) 

Once I realized that Job1 was legit, and that it wasn't a scam, I figured just accepting that one and declining the other would be a good idea, since I knew that $30/hr was more than I've ever made before and Itd be enough for us to live comfortably. However, then I realized I could accept both, take Job2 and I'd be making over $100,000/yr between the two. This would be enough money for me to completely change my life. Not just my life, but also be enough to change the life of some of my close family members who i care deeply for and have desperate wished I had the ability to help financially.

J1($30/hr) is a contract, with opportunity for FTE, is extremely lax, remote, shift is any 8hrs from 6:30am-6:30pm Mon-Fri. Really minimal work. Maybe 1 or 2hrs out of each shift will be ""busy"". Fortune 100 company with great potential perks, and great coworkers. Great boss. Really happy with this role. Only downside is I'm through staffing agency and I've had bad experiences with agencies before and don't want to risk the same thing happening again.

J2($25/hr) is FTE, internal hire for overnight Sysadmin shifts. 4 days a week. Great benefits. Lots of potential for growth. Company seems promising long term. They really liked me during interviews, adamantly wanted me for this role and pursued me hard to fill this position. Even offering more perks than usual. Im currently waiting for my equipment to show up, and haven't started with them yet. But I have accepted the offer letter, signed all paperwork and gone through onboarding. Should be starting within 10 days, equipment scheduled to show up by Thurs.

I have been working with J1 for 2 weeks now, and have a good grasp on what my typical work week will be like. Lots of down time throughout the day. No micromanaging BS. I can come and go throughout the day as long as I am doing some stuff each day, no one will complain about me being gone for an hour or two. 

My main concerns are:

1. If I start J2, I will be working overnight on opposite schedules of J1. With my current schedule, the best time frame I could think to work for J1 would be 6:30am - 2:30pm. Giving me 6 hours of time to sleep/rest until J2 starts at 8PM.

2. With J2 going from 8pm to 6am, I'd have to get off and then immediately start shift with J1. With basically no time to rest. 

3. I would be able to take like 1 or 2 hour naps during the day, during J1. To make up for the lack of sleep. But at the very least I know that I would  have Fri, Sat and Sun to catch up on sleep while being off from J2 on Fri, Sat, and Sun. And off from J1 on Sat, and Sun. 

4. I would need to essentially survive on 6 consecutive hours of sleep Mon-Thurs, with 1, 2 or 3 hours of naps/sleep available throughout the day. 

I'm really, just mainly concerned about the potential negative effects this will have on my mental/physical health, but overall I feel like I can 100% handle the work schedule. At least for a couple months. 

I'm not concerned about the work being super stressful, or being overworked, since J1 is very lax and don't have a lot to do during shift. And J2 being overnight, I won't have much to do with them either. Primarily just sitting and waiting to fix things if something goes wrong. 

At the very least, if I can handle both jobs even for just a couple months. This would give me WAYY more money than I'd need to find a place of my own, get everything my fiancee and I need to take care of medically/personally, etc. And for the first time in my life I would actually have enough money to save up and develop an emergency fund/savings. 

If, after a few months, I just can't do it anymore, I figure I'd make a choice on which job I want to keep and then put in notice for the other job and then stick with whatever one I think will end up being the best long term.. 

I'm sorry for the wall of text, I know it's a lot, but it's been a really difficult situation for me and I am desperate to have my own home again. There is a lot of nuance and information I didn't include here in an effort to condense everything and make it more digestible,. 

I'm hoping to hear from someone who has maybe gone through something similar to me with this. Either working 2 jobs on conflicting schedules and making it work, what the outcome was, etc. Or hoping to hear from someone who can tell me if this is a bad idea, and I shouldn't do it, or if I 100% should do it and take advantage of it while I can. 

The thought of being able to use that extra money to help my family is so exciting... It makes me so happy to think of all the ways I'll be able to help my parents, my siblings, and the ways my fiancee and I will be able to have a better life...

you guys are right though, it‚Äôs my job, i only stayed for so long cause it was the only job that hired me out of the million jobs i applied for. and trust me, i made a million touches to my resume, applied to a million different types of jobs. i have also been trying to go to school for a while, got my phlebotomist certification, but working full time makes it really hard to go to school. even online school doesn‚Äôt offer the classes i‚Äôm interested in although i regret not going to school while working my WFH job. i‚Äôm going to look more into ways i can go to school but my main problem is i have no passions for anything i can go to school for currently. also, if anyone has any recommendations for WFH jobs i feel that would be really beneficial to me at this time.

I feel like a little girl stuck in a 22 year old woman‚Äôs body rn. 

My degree was in business and focused on IT but I minored in psychology. I was working 12+ hours a day and did not even enjoy the work I was doing. I had 2 IT jobs and quit both in under a year bc they both has the same issues of no work/life balance, training, and just me not being interested. I got good feedback in my role tho.

I've been suffering through burnout as I've been working and studying non-stop with no break so I decided to take some time off to figure out what I want to do. I decided I value my health and work/life balance over the money I was making. 

I'm thinking about going back to school and maybe pursuing a Phd in psychology to maybe become a professor or a psychologist since I was always interested in the field and possibly try to study abroad. 

Another option I was thinking is maybe getting my MBA and focus on a business field that I might be more interested in but I‚Äôm really unsure if I even enjoy business in general. 

I was also looking into insurance since I heard it provides good training, good salary, and good work/life balance so I‚Äôll have the stability but I‚Äôm not really interested in it so I‚Äôm a little lost. 

I also considered jobs that are more data entry or excel based bc those are skills I‚Äôm more comfortable with (like a Risk Analyst) but I‚Äôm still lost. 

I want to find the balance of doing something I enjoy, having good work/life balance, and making enough to support myself but it just seems impossible.

I‚Äôve been crying every single day and just feel so alone and like a huge failure. I know I sound dramatic but it feels like my life is over. 

I‚Äôm really worried I might be making a mistake and not be able to have a stable career path or struggle to find a job afterwards or maybe even end up disliking the path as well.

I'm just really lost on how to know what path is the right one for you. I don't want to keep making the same mistakes over and over again and end up unhappy.

My mom and stepdad were abusive and part of the abuse was making sure I was a target‚Ä¶ bad/dirty/stained/ripped clothes cuz all I got was hand me downs from other families (I was the eldest but my younger sibling got all the new clothes) and a really bad, short and choppy haircut. It was bad enough they got a social worker visit and paid for haircuts after but that was after middle school. And when I was late (cuz I didn‚Äôt have an alarm clock and they slept in) stepdad drove me long way to school just so he could go on the front lawn making a scene and yelled obscenities at me calling me a whore etc which spurred lovely rumours that I was a whore and lived in a trailor park and my stepdad was my pimp. It was middle school. :/

I was not attractive by any means.

I went to Rite Aid in one city for over 10 years. Moved to an adjacent city, and got frustrated with that Rite Aid, but still always paid under $5 for my prescriptions (not refillable).

Yesterday, I decided to try Fred Meyer pharmacy. After she got my information in, she quoted me over $200! She said she didn't know why, but it was going against my deductible. She used something like Cheaprx and got it down to $17 for me. Then when the pharmacist herself came up to take my payment, I mentioned it to her. She said it must be because they aren't a preferred pharmacy for my insurance. 

I didn't know this was a thing! So I'll tolerate Rite Aid's BS and pay way less for my prescriptions.",Head-Drag-1440,3,7,1.0

299,How do you maintain friendships in your adulthood?,11hxs7j,"I ask because I meet a lot of people nowadays, but I've often struggled with maintaining anything long-term with them. I've become something of an introvert over the years, and I've been finding that my social battery depletes a little too quickly. This in turn results in me socially hibernating for a few weeks (or even months). Sometimes, I'll end up moving away without having spent enough time with people before I go. Many of my friendships fade this way, but I'm unsure about how to go about it. 

Historically, I was perfectly fine being a listener or confidant, as I liked making people feel heard, and still do. However, most people don't want that from someone they haven't known that long, and working from home doesn't improve matters either. I once asked my friends a while back if I was a ""bad"" friend because I didn't talk to them enough, and their response was ""no, because I just don't need social interaction in the way that they do"". This still feels bad to me though. While it was nice to hear, that group of friends frequently dragged me out to do things, and through them, I was adopted into other groups - often as the one who would listen to their problems and cheer them on. 

We've since moved to different states for work, and I now find myself in an endless loop of meeting new people, but never getting close enough to anyone to be the type of friend I want to be.",siege5548,10,12,0.94

A bit of background: I was the breadwinner of my family since I was 21.  
I gave up my dream of going to university and helped my family when my dad died from cancer during that time.   


I got a job as a virtual assistant in a start-up company, it was an alright job, I was earning $200 per month. It's an okay amount for a developing country but it didn't leave me much to be able to save.   
There were times I had to take on 2 jobs just to make ends meet. 

I come from a somewhat influential family but they refused to help when my dad was battling cancer and when he died but I was proud that I was able to provide and support my mum and younger sister back then.  
I was in a relationship during this time as well and I thought he was the one because he promised we'd ''adult together'' (I was 23 during this time) 

Fast forward to 2020... 

My then boyfriend at that time wanted to open up our relationship because he lost his feelings for me since 2019, this hurt me a lot and begged him not to.   
But he made up his mind and left. (I later found out that he has been seeing the other woman since 2019 when he reached out to me to ask for forgiveness, I was gullible at that time and forgave him but I still had this sinking feeling in my stomach). 

This event sent me to a dark and sad path. 

I went to therapy since this incident and have been feeling okay for most parts:   
I was able to support and provide for my family during the pandemic, I managed to survive COVID despite getting it twice, and was working 2 jobs to support my family and myself (I was 27 at this time).   


However, I ran into some bad luck last year (age 28): I lost my 2 dogs (I've had them since I was 17) and lost both jobs (one job wasn't doing well, the other job fired me for not smiling because I was taking down notes during a Zoom meeting).   
I've been applying to jobs since then but I've not had any luck, I did manage to work during November 2022 until February but it was project-based and I got sick from that job. 

I've been feeling inadequate lately because of the countless rejections I've gotten and will probably be getting since I'm on the job hunt again.   
I want to go back to uni but I don't have the financial means to do it, I can't ask for help from other family members because they were never helpful to me, I can't take out a loan because most of them would require me to have a job.   


I''ve been wanting to migrate to another country to find a better job but I don't know where to start or have the means for it.   
I don't have a degree, I speak/write decent English I think, I'm currently learning German by myself, I have skills I suppose but they don't seem to be the ones western countries are looking for :(  


I can't help but feel like a failed adult because I see my peers getting married, having kids, and settling down already (personally, I don't want to have kids but I hate how people in my country have this mindset that kids = success in life)  
I have a wonderful boyfriend who has been my rock since June 2022 and he means the world to me but I'd like to be able to do more for him, I know it's not a healthy relationship is not a competition but I'd like to be of help.

357,At what point do you call quits on a friendship?,11f8rir,"In my (31f) universe friendships usually should include reciprocating the efforts that I am making to have you in my life.

It doesn't have to be big. When I am busy over months I usually keep in touch by just sending memes or songs that might remind me of my friends. Specially long distance friends. All I ask is reciprocate in small efforts, doesn't have to be big. If someone shares music, even that is enough for me. But too much to ask. Everyone is too busy.

Now, a lot of my girlfriends got married and disappeared. As happy as I am for them, it sucks that I haven't heard. They claim that marriage is different than a relationship. I had been dating my ex partner for longer than they had met their respective partners. I lived with my in-laws and him through covid for about 2 years. Still.... unless you are married, its not legit relationship in their opinion so yes, its okay for me to find time while I am in relationship but getting married changes everything apparently. It hurt so much so many times hearing that unless I was married it wasn't legit, specially because my ex refused to propose or get married (one of the reasons to separation). Same thing happened with my brother. This is hurting more than anything. I am afraid to reach out because I know it will be like talking to a wall. I just got ghosted multiple times by another friend. I have decided not to respond if they contact me. Rarely if someone from school or college reaches out for birthdays or whatever, all they ask is when I am getting married. I am already hurt over stuff and this doesn't help. A married friend who constantly wants to reach out only to vent about bad marriage and just complain, I sense hostility and negative energy in her. Also some envy because I separated from toxic situation and now am on way to get PhD and surely happier now at least with work side of things, and she is jobless in a very toxic marriage far away from home.

They have disappeared to the point where I haven't told any of them that my ex and I separated 5ish months ago. Not even sending memes or songs or old pics just as memory. I feel empty and alone. These are friends I have know since 9th grade. My brother is someone who isn't related to me but when we met in college we loved each other so much and instantly became part of each other's lives and family. Both our families know and love us. I attended his wedding online because I am away. Being in another continent doesn't help keeping in touch with friends.

I do not understand when you know that the friendship is over? I am feeling most of them are over at this point. I see no one reciprocating efforts. I am disappointed of making consistent efforts. And sad as well. This is a hard part of being an adult. I am very patient and understanding that people are busy, they have responsibilities etc etc.

I have no one to turn to for guidance or support so please be kind :') I'm also based in NJ if this helps.

Just come to find out the insurance I signed up with through my workplace doesn't include dental. On top of that, I recently went through an xray procedure that wasn't covered through the same insurance and I applied for charity care at the hospital ($1400)...

It's making me think, should I have just opted for marketplace insurance? I don't understand insurance at all nor the plan I'm under through my workplace. I've always had ""free"" insurance through, at one point, my mom, but now I'm on my own and I don't know if I'm making the right choices.

Overview of what my job offers:  
BCBS Omnia  
Deductible: Tier 1 In Network- $1,300 / Tier 2 In Network- $2,500. Out of Pocket: 8,700 for both  
Office Visits: T1- $30 PCP, $60; Specialist $15; Telemedicine $15 / T2- $15 Telemedicine, 50% PCP, 50% Specialist, 50% Tele after deductible.

None of this sorta makes sense to me but the few doctor visits I've had I just been paying the $30 or $15 here and there. I understand the application process for the marketplace is closed for this period but when it opens again, should I just opt for that over my jobs' insurance?

I took the drawer out and really debated a good few minutes whether I was gonna take it or not. 

I noticed some stains on it and it was a bit wobbly so I thought that was why it was trashed. 

It was dark but I used my phone light.

I cannot believe how dumb I was to not look more closely. I mean I spent minutes debating and analyzing with my phone light. I should have checked once I brought it inside but I didn‚Äôt. 

I am absolutely terrified of roaches and unfortunately I live in North Texas and they‚Äôre pretty much everywhere. I get extremely uncomfortable with photos and in person I‚Äôll cry. I have trauma with them. My boyfriend thinks these are baby ones since they‚Äôre small.

I overnighted traps bc I couldn‚Äôt find the ones I already own. 

This was last night (couldn‚Äôt sleep till 3am bc I was so shaken) and I found a couple more tonight.

My boyfriend is reassuring me bc I‚Äôm an extremely clean person and I got rid of the source (back to the dumpster IMMEDIATELY) they‚Äôll go away. And the traps will kill the leftovers.

387,How have your friendships changed as an adult?,11dy5kl,"I‚Äôm in my mid 30s, deep in little kid life, and have noticed my friendships have changed a lot over the years. Curious if others have had similar experiences because it can feel‚Ä¶.lonely at times. I have people I can text and make plans with but I don‚Äôt feel like I have that amazing, talk all day BFF type of friendship. Are those even real or just in movies?! 

When I think back on friendships, it seems there was always a common connection for what started the friendship and when that ended, the relationship sort of drifted too- for example, I had a close group of friends at my last work. We would do happy hours, trips, etc. But once a few of us left, the friendships eventually faded too. Now we don‚Äôt talk at all. 

Now in parenthood, it‚Äôs hard to make friends and seems I have a hard time relating to my friends from before I had kids (there‚Äôs no time, hard to relate to life experiences, etc) or I struggle to connect with my parent friends if our lives are different (for example, one friend makes significantly more and I find it hard to relate with her now). We all still talk once in a while, go to bday parties or the big life events, etc but the closeness and frequency has changed. Now I only really talk to other school parents on a regular basis. I also had some friendships where it felt like I did all the reaching out. And I just feel like I‚Äôm too old to be chasing people down every time. Either you want to be friends, and put effort in, or you don‚Äôt.

The story is, my single dad raised me on hamburger helper and frozen meals. I know the basics of cooking and can follow instructions just fine but when it comes to meal planning I fail given the only structure I had for meal planning was school breakfast/lunch schedules. I've tried again and again to teach myself but I keep hitting a wall and at this point have given up on trying to figure it out. I buy what comes to mind at the moment and mainly let my partner handle this but even he isnt very good, he does stuff on the fly as well. We're lucky if we have 1 or 2 days planned. Grocery shopping it frantic and a best guess on it sounds good.

Im good with money, bills are paid with no issues but the food buying stuff just... i cant grasp it and when I try to learn I get frustated and once I get frustated its impossible for me to learn ANYTHING (in any part of my life), part of my 31 years of untreated ADHD I assume.

I could really using a guiding hand in this so we can better our eating habits and spending when it comes to food because I know we spend more than we should but I just dont get how.

I've done the 'look up meals and make those' thing. Thats not what I need. I need to figure out how to break it down to a shopping list that isnt a bizillion items each but at the same time I can't just buy in bulk because that doesnt mean I know what meals to make.

399,How are you suppose to move when it's too expensive to stay??,11dj9od," So,  I‚Äôm in this ‚Äòrock and a hard place‚Äô situation right now that just has  me spiraling and I‚Äôm just not even sure what to do next. I have a small  family, my wife and I, her mother (disabled with fixed income), our  18month old son‚Äîand my wife is now newly pregnant with our second child.  We‚Äôre renting a two bed two bath apartment at the moment, but the  economy has made rent and food costs spike to a point that we just can‚Äôt  afford it anymore. We were looking at leaving our preferred city, but a  friend who wants us to stay (and is much better established than us)  has offered us the unbelievable break to rent a house he owns for well  under market value and right in our budget range.   

The problem is that the current tenants aren‚Äôt scheduled to leave until  end of may, and our lease ends march 20th (no idea why its not the end  of the month but w/e) so we‚Äôre looking at either signing a new lease  and breaking it, costing us $3200, or rent month to month for three  months at an inflated price that adds $500 per month which will change our rent from about $1700 to $2100 per month. We only have just under $3,000 saved up from our tax  returns, but we have other expenses coming. Our car needs repairs, the  driver side door doesn‚Äôt open from the outside, and my pregnant wife  can‚Äôt keep jumping the middle console and our car was broken into last night (apparently) and they tried to take the steering wheel, we were able to put it back but some lights were popped out and need to be put back-I have no idea what it's going to cost to fix OR what it will cost us to turn on utilities on the new place, or whether we get all the appliances in the new house. Also, my wife's work didn't have work almost all last week so we're looking at a week without pay too, so that's another $2-300 out of our savings.

We're already living on a razor's edge as far as our finances go, we have been living pay check to pay check for years now, so we have no additional savings squirreled anywhere. I usually also work with my wife, but since the baby was born I've been made the prime baby care person (as my wife and her mother don't get along so they can't be at home all day together). I am an artist and get some low key commission work, but I can only get about 3 hrs of work done per day, and that's only if my wife isn't home and also needing care, and that right now is only equaling about $50 a week. We have been working on our credit, but after a dry patch of no work our credit cards are maxed out. We were suppose to put a bunch of our tax return money toward paying them off (around $2500 was the original plan) but we weren't planning on moving back when that was planned, and I just don't see how that's possible now. I'm already thinking about leaning on our friendship a little and asking if we can wave our move in month's rent with our friend, or just set it up so we pay it off the next couple of months, but he's also not charging us things like deposits and other move in costs that usually come with moving into a new place-so I feel awful asking for any more from him.

I just don't understand how anyone is suppose to be able to do this?? We can't afford to stay in the place we're at, but we CAN afford this place we're going to, but we can't afford to STOP living at this unaffordable place to move to that affordable place. What do normal adults do in situations like this?? Are there loans we should be applying for? Are there assistance programs we could apply for? We're already on things like food assistance to make sure our boy gets enough food, meanwhile we're living on like $50 a week for groceries for ourselves-I'm hungry, stressed, and so SO tired. I have so much guilt tied to things like...asking people for money, that I'm even twisting with guilt for being given such a kind and generous opportunity. I don't want to lose out on everything because I don't do the right thing now-but I don't know what the right thing IS?!

407,How do I ‚ÄúKnow My Value‚Äù for a salary?,11dkt3r,"(Sorry if I‚Äôm making any posting etiquette mistakes; didn‚Äôt actually have a reddit account until now. I just browse sometimes!)

I turned 21 this week, & have been interviewing for new jobs. While many interviews have gone well & I'm expecting some formal offers soon, the part I really struggle with is the salary negotiation.

I do have 3+ years of relevant experience in the field I‚Äôm looking at- including being promoted to an assistant manager position at a repeat seasonal job- but I can‚Äôt factor for previous hourly rates as I was paid a set rate (Residential job, so 6 days/week all day)(Fun fact, if i was paid hourly with OT, I would‚Äôve made MINIMUM $13k every season, instead I made $1k for very high-level training-intensive work :p).   
I‚Äôve worked other jobs too- retail and tourism and especially customer service. I‚Äôd be the one my managers would call over to handle an irate customer, haha.

The other factor is that whole, y'know, scary-inflated-price-of-living thing. I hate sounding like I‚Äôm just in it for the money, but I‚Äôm a college student attempting to move out and afford my own tuition + rent + insurance ($300/month since I‚Äôm a new driver, yikes). These places made it seem like they reward high effort with an hourly rate over minimum wage (which is great!), but, in reality? $16/hr full time just BARELY covers my needs. I'm immunocompromised and would desperately rather try for better than the moldy apartments at the lower-end $1k/month, but I may not have a choice.  
I don‚Äôt have the luxury of substantial financial help from a parent. My single mom doesn‚Äôt have much income already, and I‚Äôm being kicked out in 4 months.

It still feels so picky to want to negotiate higher, especially since I doubt any employers would entertain an hourly over $16.50‚Ä¶ (Trust me, I've tried. Gotten raised brows in response). But frankly, I‚Äôm also starting to feel so burnt out when I‚Äôm in a field that requires high emotional effort, even when I'm so passionate about it- when it doesn't even reward my future goals in life. Hell, it doesn't even reward my current needs.

How am I supposed to know my ‚Äúemployee value‚Äù? I know my experience, but what‚Äôs an objective way to calculate ‚Äúeffort‚Äù when pay isn‚Äôt realistically based on effort?

If i dont get an answer here too, well.... ill continue asking on another site...

&#x200B;

I'll just TDLR my situation and myself. 

*(Update: It became a long one sorry)* ***\[Also sorry for the cussing and excuse my panicked all-caps\]***

&#x200B;

* Recently, I graduated from high school (Secondary 5 \[in Quebec\])- This February. At the age of 23 years old and I finally, got my diploma after years of suffering and going through extreme depression at the same time. *(Already depressing. I went through a lot internally and mentally, dealt with harmful/impactful family problems, puberty, extreme self doubt, severe depression, more personal shit, letting an ED control my life, other struggles, etc. That's why I graduated very late.)*
* I'm jobless at the moment. Jobless in a small town that has very VERY limited jobs for younglings and young adults like me because half of the lucky younglings took the spots. Even struggling adults in their 30's couldn't get a few jobs as well. Leaving the rest of us, jobless, in a town that's far away from cities that we have to take a plan or an 9+ hour drive to get out of here. 
* I have no car. I'm currently in a driving school program tho, a student. I have 3 teachers in total. My contract will end in 2024. Hopefully, i'll get my first car when it ends. And we gotta pay 800$ for this program in a few months.
* I'm soon to be 24 years old in may 21 2023. *(i have a feeling im definitely spending it alone again...)*
* I have NO FRIENDS, at all. Absolutely no one. Not even online friends. It's been like this for 12 years now. So I don't know how to socialize or how to be normal when it comes to personal-PERSONAL face to face talks. I don't even talk to my relatives anymore. Or even to my only parent, my dad. *(a lot of unnecessary and unfortunate things happened between us, which hurt me deeply so... let's just say i'm just another broken daughter holding suppressed-rage towards her only dad, who still supports me somehow...and doesn't want me to 'off' it.)* 
* I'm a 'shut-in' / a 'NEET' / a 'Hikikomori', since when I was 13 years old. And i'm still one. I rarely go outside. I just stay in my room. This 'shut-in' hermit lifestyle just gradually took over and devoured my 'normal' lifestyle the more I aged. So it's a major struggle to get out of it. And once I do get out of it, *(i tried multiple times, to work. or worked. i left.)*, I panic and I just come back to it... And i would just rot away all over again in my room. This is a whole different struggle. I just WISH i could be in some healing rehab center to get over with this life-wasting curse. 

Anyway. 

* I'm not very social, I don't know how to make conversations, I even panic internally when I'm being talked to (even online/personal DMs) so I tend to just leave everyone on 'read' because my panic took over. And fear.
* I don't drink or smoke. Never had a bf either.
* \[Additional information: My aunt, JT, (my dad's side) lives in the city that i'm planning to move in, alone, by myself. And another aunt, KH, (my mom's side) lives in it as well.  
JT has two young adult boys and a husband; one boy has his own apartment now. KH has 2 young adult daughters and herself living in an apartment complex. Both, I am estranged to now. So itll be awkward.
* I don't talk to the both of them that much... Because, I'm a recluse. So.... i dont know.
* I'm fluent in english, not french even tho im a quebec citizen.
* I dont have a birth certificate, a passport, social security card, drivers license. Only have my ''indian-status'' card *(why the f do we need these?)*, debit card, health insurance card and my academic records/diploma.
* That's all. 

\~ 

The more I have aged, i have become a girl with the desire to get out. And live. (and chose the wrong time, right COVID?) but it is what it is. I need to get the hell out of here. I just want to work in a convenience store dude. And make new friends. 

  
So, I have a specific goal in mind. 

(This, i need tips/advices/ideas with.)

I want to go to a vocational school (trade school) or college to study either accounting, book-keeping, pastry classes, bakery classes or a vet-assistant classes, 

BUT before that-I DEEPLY **DEEEEEPLY** want to work in a city first, in a big magical city.... That has lots of people, lots of job opportunities, lots of food, lots of apartments. Lots of EVERYTHING. Minimum wage, I'm okay with. for now. A roommate, sure. 

I just want to work, in a city, raise a little funds. *(To add; I oddly have this strong passion to work in a convenience store)*

While I'm still young, I also just want to enjoy the city life while i'm at it, live in a cool shabby cheap apartment, experience what the city has to offer, walk on the sidewalks, go to a DOG PARK or go to the theaters. 

Just...taste EVERYTHING. Be in an NPC mode. I dont care. 

And once I'm satisfied, I am ready to go to a vocational school or college. 

I want to do things in the city. But, not here. Not in this rotting town.  


But the thing is.... 

**I AM BROKE AS SHIT, I'M DUMB, I HAVE EXTREME SELF-DOUBT, I'M DEPRESSED, I'M ALONE, I'M MENTALLY SOFT, THERE'S COVID, I HAVE NO CAR, I'M JOBLESS, I'M UNDER A DRIVING SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT I CAN'T CANCEL AND MY DRIVING INSTRUCTOR IS IN THIS TOWN SO I CANT JUST LEAVE, I'M SCARED TO LEAVE THE NEST, I HAVE A 12 Y.O DOG THAT I DONT WANT TO LEAVE BECAUSE I LOVE HIM HES OLD NOW, THERES WEIRD PEOPLE OUT THERE TRYNA KIDNAP MY 'KIND' A.K.A; INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN COUNTLESS CITIES, THERES RACISM, THE WORLD IS A SCARY PLACE AND LASTLY, I'M A RECLUSE GIRL.** 

I asked some advices, with this same template about myself on some other website and they said it's a dangerous goal, just because, well.... I'm a girl. A girl who's alone. In a city. Also, who's broke. And of-color. (I'm native american).

''Murdered, Missing, Indigenous women'' or so they call it. 

Which, this is what I also think about in the midst of trying to make my goal, HAPPEN.

Making me halt in my tracks and shrivel back into my room. All because of these reasons up above\^

And there's also more reasons that makes me hesitate, but Ill spare my fingers.

So... realistically, 

What do i do? 

What should I do? Is it gonna be easy or hard? Is it possible? How can I STOP doubting my self and my future? Why can't I just 'DO IT'? How can I be a confident LEADER, in my own life and my own decisions? Why am I such a wuss? Are there even trustable people that can help me? Should I rely on my aunties? What am I so afraid of? 

**What would be the first thing that you would do if you were in my situation?**

**And what would you do AFTER your first thing/move?**

How does signing up for an apartment work?

How tf do I get out of this town? 

Welp.

427,"Jack of all hobbies, enjoyer of none",11cfwsv,"TL;DR: I have too many hobbies and not enough time to actually enjoy any of them..

So this is something which has been on my mind for a while now. Over the years I've accumulated many hobbies and enjoyable pasttimes, but over the last couple of years I've found I don't have the time to dedicate to them to actually e joy them. Btw I have ADHD, I literally have the habit of seeing something online which catches my interest and immediately hyper fixating on it, it becomes difficult separating the things I'm passionate about Vs the flavour of the week.

Since the birth of my son almost all of my free time during the day is spent either with him or working. I also work full time so the only time I ever really have is an hour or two each evening and the weekends (which are spent pretty much exclusively with my son and partner).

In 2 months, I will be turning 30. And I want to embrace the occasion by actually trying to enjoy what spare time I have. So I've come to the realisation that to actually dedicate enough time to enjoy my hobbies I need to reduce the number of ones I have.

Here is a list of all of my hobbies that I currently try to make time for:

PC gaming - I've spent a lot of money over the years on building my gaming PC, the games I like to play though are single player RPGs that I like to immerse myself in, jumping on for a 'quick game' isn't really an option if I want to actually enjoy it.

Guitar - I've been playing both acoustic and electric guitar for almost 20 years, but I find I barely pick any of them up anymore. I feel guilty at the thought of giving it up because it's been a huge part of my life until the last 4 years.

Board Games - I used to attend a weekly board gaming night and so have accumulated a lot of games. I don't really go anymore and only occasionally play a handful of my collection.

Miniature Painting and Wargames - Again this is a hobby I know I really enjoy and love putting my time into, but I can't just dip in and out of it or else I lose focus. The wargaming side of the hobby also has a major social aspect to my life as I play it with my best friends, so I don't want to give it up.

Hiking - I love getting outdoors, I used to go on long walks and camping with my dad when I was younger. I work a desk job as well so doing this is some of the only exercise I get.

Bouldering - I got into bouldering about a year ago and stuck with it for a few months before giving it up for financial reasons - instead choosing to go to the gym down the road from me (which I didn't stick to). I'd like to pick it back up again because it's great exercise and I genuinely really enjoy it.

There's a few others as well, but you get the picture. I'm struggling to enjoy life right now due to just not knowing how to spend my time. I feel like I can't enjoy any of my hobbies because I'll feel guilty not spending it doing others.. I don't know if this is something we all go through as we get older or if it's just me. But if anyone has any suggestions as to what I should do it might give me the inspiration to prioritise my time better.",SweatyGreb,7,8,1.0

On another note, I don't do delivery. For one, I have seen people have terrible experiences with food being delivered. Two, companies like UberEats and DoorDash pay their drivers next to nothing and they really should be forced to give their drivers a living wage. With that being said, why do people do it?

For a short period, my husband did DoorDash but after a few weeks we realized it was eating up his time more than he was making to show for it, so he stopped. He did it to make ends meet, but it really didn't help.

Today during my session, for the first time, I drew on paper exactly what I was going through. The unstoppable thoughts of danger or like some unknown person was out to get me. I was extremely ashamed to admit this and I still am. It's has become crippling though. To the point that sleeping was difficult 

I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't describe It in words, so I drew it on paper instead 

I got a ways to go. But it's nice to know I got the ability to open up. Even if it takes awhile

442,How should I deal with this healthcare bill issue?,11c1a9r,"I have a bill for $300 from a clinic I visited in a different city. It's been over a year since this visit. I called the clinic last month and they said the bill had been denied by my insurance, only reason they gave me was the insurance said I wasn't an active member. Yes I was. The visit was on 05/17/21 and my insurance was active starting 05/01/21. They refused to send the bill to my insurance again ""because it's been too long"" and tell me basically it's my problem now. 

I call my insurance, and they can't find evidence of this visit/bill in their system. They're supposed to keep everything on file, even denials. Normally I'd ""appeal"" or ""contest"" their denial but it's kind of pointless because they don't have anything regarding this visit in their system. 

Now a rep from my insurance company is supposed to be calling the clinic and discussing it with the billing department but as far as I know they've called the clinic twice with no answer. They leave a voicemail and no one calls them back. 

I just don't know what to do at this point. I had the coverage and the bill should have been paid. Why am I paying for my health insurance to end up chasing all these people down and argue with them. It's madness. I'm disabled ffs. It's hard enough to advocate for my needed healthcare. I've literally started documenting what's said in phone calls for stuff like this because my short term memory can't keep up with 3-month-long sagas of this bs.

443,Got My 4th & 5th Credit Card Approved! (Success),11bl5jg,"I'm (23f) and I am over the moon that I got my 4th & 5th Credit Card this year. I know five credit cards sounds horrible to a normal person but I have been extremely responsible since my first CC in 2020 (WF Student Card into Active Card). I have no one to tell so I thought this might be a good place to tell my success at adulting. 

For a little context: I was always told that credit cards are bad and to never get one from my parents. They hate credit cards and would immediately dismiss the conversation (Since they have a history with bad credit). Thankfully I was told how important it is to build credit from my bf and got one in 2020 (Which is sadly my worst card, don't recommend). 

I didn't seriously get into it until a year ago when I started doing extensive research on how Credit Cards work and have been actively learning better ways to manage my current Credit Cards. I have been able to get the most use out of them and have an overall higher credit score thanks to the help of YouTube and Reddit Threads. I plan on getting one more credit card which is the Chase Sapphire Preferred ($95 annual fee*) to completed the Chase Trifecta at the end of the year.  

Here are my Stats:
üí≥ WF Active Cash: $3,200 (2020)
üí≥ Chase Unlimited: $3,500 (2021)
üí≥ Chase Freedom Flex: $5,200  (2022)
üí≥ Amex Blue Everyday Card: $10,200 (2023)
üí≥ Capital One Savor One: $20,000 (2023)

Credit Score:
FICO Score 9 - 756
TransUnion & Equifax - 736
Experian - 739

No annual fee on any of my credit cards! Each card is for certain spending categories as well which help with earning points. I use less than 9% utilization on each of these cards and pay the statement in full every month. No missed/late payments. The only thing that is effecting my credit score is having a short account history and my student loan from college which is 20k, big oof. 

I hope this post can help someone who might have the same situation as me or haven't thought of building credit. It takes years to build good credit which can help you get a car or even a house one day. I am looking into renting an apartment real soon and they ask for good credit. Please do some research first before making that decision and most importantly, have a job or an income to pay off the statement balance in full. Thank you for reading and I wish you luck on your journey! I would be happy to discuss more with all of you and I am open to any advice as well! ‚ù§Ô∏è

444,helping my 2 adult sisters,11bs5f4,"i 21M am the oldest sibling of all my siblings and my sisters both 18F have depression and bipolar and things have been rough for them. My youngest sister has been in and out of an inpatient facility for self harm and threatening suicide to her adoptive mother and my other sister is struggling with health complications and drug use and depression. I want to help them as much as I can but I don't know what I can do, I had to do something similar with my older cousin a year back after her boyfriend was killed and she lived with me for some time and i helped her recover as much as I could and she's in a way better spot now.

I've been struggling badly with the idea of suicide myself for years and especially lately but I don't want to leave them behind and me doing so might cause something much worse to happen. And usually when things like this happen with family I feel like forgetting my problems and stepping up and helping them. And I'm gonna have to do it again but I don't know what I should do exactly.

We don't live together but all of us are split up across the state. And both have been talking about moving out of their current living situation.

My reasoning for doing this is that I have been scrolling through Reddit and have seen many people get ‚Äúscrewed over‚Äù by their insurance. While I will not say the insurance company is always in the right, the buyers are not always aware of what they are buying. Whether the broker they bought from didn‚Äôt mention it, or that insurance simply had an exclusion for a certain medication or wouldn‚Äôt accept pre-existing conditions. We are all growing up which is perfectly okay, we all start somewhere.

There are many reasons as to why issues arise when dealing with insurance, I can‚Äôt speak and won‚Äôt speak for the insurance companies, and I simply want to inform people as to what they have and what they would want to look for.

So to give some context I've had a few jobs already mostly based around aquatics. The job I loved the most so far was being a head Guard at an indoor Waterpark. Honestly loved the fast pacing of it and knowing that if I fucked up someone could and would easily die. I felt like my work actually mattered. I took on the job because my end goal was joining the coast guard to either be a non-rate or go into MSRT I think it was called (a tactical defense team against terrorist trying to enter the US) I've always loved the thought of having a job like that. I didn't join the coast guard because of person beliefs. So to say the least, I love jobs that are high action and fast paced and ones where I wouldn't have to go through years of school. Not a fan of school. On the contrary I also would really love to learn carpentry. And I think in still gonna go for a carpentry apprenticeship no matter what just to give it a shot really and see how I feel about it.

So I'm sorry if this is kinda said in a very shit manner I don't know the best way of going about asking this I'm really lost with it.

A couple years ago in college I developed IBS out of nowhere and it dramatically altered my life. I kept thinking it would go away or pushing my doctor for more tests for years, and it occupied my mind a lot, but every test including SIBO came back normal so now I'm just trying to work on accepting it. And it has been a major obstacle in my life and a cause of my depression. Last year I moved in with my parents and lucked out in landing a remote job, and pretty much just been living at home for a little over a year now saving up. However they live in a suburb of Texas that's very car centric and lots of mid 30s families here. I've pretty much just sunken even deeper into a robotic routine and just kind of shutting off from life, not going out and seeing anyone or doing much of *anything*. Even in college when I was going through this I still went out a bit and had some friends. Yesterday I just got notified that I'm being let go from my job. Over the past year I have about 50k saved up and a car as well but I feel like I've lost a lot of my adulting skills by living at home because my parents cook all the food and I barely do anything. 

I originally grew up in NJ and have friends and family living in the east coast from my high school days, plus I feel like I might have a better chance of finding a partner if I lived there (I'm gay and the gay scene in NY looks so promising). And ever since graduating college I have thought about whether or not my life would be better if I moved. But dealing with this ibs, idk. Now I'm going to be without a job too, I am feeling super lost. Like I have built up a bit of savings and my parents are amazing and willing to help support me (they pay my car insurance as part of a family plan).

I don't have any coding background and have a degree in biology so yeah... I'm not even sure what I want to do other than some generic officy job. 

So where do I go from here? Would it be a smart idea or a disaster to move to someplace like Jersey city without a job or plan and then start applying for something there? I've been looking online and people say to get an airbnb or extended stay hotel. Would that even help in my situation? On one hand here at home I don't have to worry about anything, but I feel like I'm stagnating. And I just don't have much ambition for any kind of career in particular.

For the past 8 months, I've felt so lazy. On my days off, I stay awake late as I can and then the next day I stay in bed all day until 5 - 6pm. Things like brushing my teeth and taking a shower seem like such big big things that require so much energy. 
When I have work, I put off getting ready until the last minute.
I either eat too much in one go or barely eat anything at all. 
Mostly, I'm in a numb content average emotion state but then sometimes I get these waves of sadness. 
Sometimes I feel like crying for no reason. 
Any activities that I enjoy, like reading or whatever, I haven't done in months and months. 
I feel like a lump of clay.

I'm currently on PTO from work and I'm already halfway through and realised I've wasted it by doing nothing but mess around on my phone and watch TV shows I've already seen before.

So, my poor toilet has a really gross and hard to scrape off ring of yellow and brown directly under the rim. Like towards the top where the water usually flows in from. No toilet scrubbers I can find will reach up there and after enough scrubbing the bristles become flattened while the buildup remains. How do I get rid of this? 

Do I need to put CLR in the tank?

I recently purchased scrubbers that attach to a drill that can bend so I can get up in there over the weekend as it's just getting uglier and uglier. I even dropped a Blue Clorox tablet in the tank some months ago but it didn't help at all. What cleaners should I use? I purchased the Bleach foaming bathroom cleaner that seems to be shining up the faucets super nicely as it can eat through soap scum, but will it be enough?

Just looking for some guidance because I'm super nitpicky about dirty bathrooms and this ugly toilet is depressing.

I just moved out of my bf of eight years and am having to start over from scratch, and I'm realizing what a child I still am (in practice, not in age, obviously). I got a letter in the mail from AAA saying I could apply for life insurance, which is a thought that's been floating around in the back of my head for a while. I know funerals are expensive, so at the very least, I think I should get a policy that will cover those costs and not leave my family with my rotting corpse to handle in the unfortunate event something were to happen. I know its kinda morbid to think about, but this is part of adulting, isn't it? 

Any tips on good policies? Are some providers better than others? Do I need a professional to help me, or can I figure this out on my own? What about premiums? Can I get a fixed rate one, or will all policies change the premiums as they see fit? I generally see insurance as a scam and don't even have health insurance... please help me figure this out.

490,I (21F) Am Leaving My Parent's House Soon,119009c,"I'm packing my things and will be staying with my girlfriend and her family. I'm deciding to leave while everyone is my house is working, and to leave a note behind, only because I've constantly been talked against moving out of the house and my parents will do everything in their power to prevent me from doing so. They very strongly do not want me to leave. My mom has had many talks with me about the negatives of being on my own, renting, etc. (as if she thinks I believe doing so is a walk in the park, I DON'T). Ever since I began to think about moving out, I gave myself realistic expectations. I value my freedom and that's what I'm want to achieve, however I realize the self-sustainability that accompanies such a decision. I have to look out for myself.

Why am I choosing to leave? For quite a few reasons. The main one being that I don't have much freedom living with my parents. They decide how I'm able to see someone. It's not as easy as telling them where I'm going and who I'll be with and walk out. I did that on Valentine's Day to spend time with my girlfriend, and when I got home I got confronted and screamed at by my parents. Unless I do it behind their backs, I can't see my girlfriend or go out with her unless she spends a few days at the house and makes my parents feel comfortable with allowing me to go on dates with her. They have to feel comfortable. Even though my partner and I have been going out (on dates) without my parents knowledge for over a year now but they have been made aware of this recently (last few months). Everything I do has to be made known to them and they have to have approve some aspect of it.

Another big reason why I've felt pushed to leave is due to the affects on my mental health caused by my parents. I have anxiety and I'm currently receiving treatment for it. My therapist has even recommended I put myself in a better environment. They have been the underlying cause and ""trigger"" to my anxiety due to how they raised me. My parents didn't psychically punish me as much as my older sibling, but whenever it happened, I felt such extreme fear, shame, and guilt. And that has carried onto me as an adult. Recently we had a serious discussion where I touched on this with my parents, and they surprisingly made an apology to me. I suspected they're trying to keep me from leaving by finally mellowing out, but it just feels too late. I feel like my relationship with my parents will only improve if I don't have them helicoptering over me. 

Another push: My privacy has been constantly invaded. I got a car a few months ago. My parents were not happy and my mom was demanding to see my documents for it. I denied that to her. My mom has gone through my receipts, my mail (that I have not seen), a bank statement, my wallet, and even a journal where I was talking about my girlfriend. Now, my partner is trans (not transitioned or out), so since I was writing about her as a woman with her chosen name, my mom therefore asked me if I'm gay (I am), but I was NOT ready for that conversation. I was also not about to out my partner. So now she suspects our relationship is some kind of cover up for something else since I didn't confirm or deny anything.

I expressed to my mom that I was hurt she went through my things and that it was an invasion of my privacy, but all she kept reiterating is that it's her house, her room, and she's a mom so she has a right to go through my things in order to find out what's going on with me (since they see my actions as rebelling and as direct attacks on themselves) and that I was lucky I had a parent who was never going to give up on them. 

I'm worried that once they find out I'm gone they're going to blow up my phone and even try to come after me. I already feel a lot of guilt leaving my family because of how worried they're going to be. But I don't intend to go NC with that at all. I intend to tell them where I am and to reassure them that I'm safe. 

I'd really appreciate some encouragement and/or advice. I've been very fearful of change, but this is always what I wanted to do, and I have a right to do so.

Edit: Thanks very much for all the comments!! I appreciate the support. Just so you all know, I did end up leaving my parents house yesterday. So far I have felt such a huge weight off my shoulders. I spoke with my therapist shortly after leaving and I feel very reassured by my choice due to her encouragement, my partner's support, and of course all the comments I've been reading here. 

Also I understand the concerns some comments had about staying with my partner's family. My wording was a bit off, but my current situation is that I am staying with my partner and her grandmother, not her parents, siblings, etc. Her grandmother is a very nice woman who is happy to have me. This isn't a permanent thing as we're merely trying to save up more money to get a place of our own.

I make good money but struggle with debt. Instead of moving forward with a sportscar, (6g down payment and 450 a month for 6 years) I made the decision to put that 6g towards a used 8g Honda, with some negotiation and trading in my current messed up car.

Kinda follow up to my post about a week and a half ago asking if moving out of my emotionally toxic *parents* house was the right call. ‚ú®It was‚ú®

I need a more experienced adult with an unbiased opinion.

My *PARENTS* are telling me that I can't go off the auto insurance plan because their rate and my rate will skyrocket. They're telling me not to legally change my address because I'll lose all insurance.

I feel like this isn't true? And I've heard a lot otherwise? Is this their way of keeping me close because they're worried about me cutting contact? Ultimately for those of you who have cut contact, was it worth it?

For the auto insurance the rate I was quoted was less than what I'm paying on a family plan. I'm sure I'll have to rate shop eventually but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

As far as changing my address, that doesn't default to kicking me off the health insurance right? I'm not yet 26 o the only thing I would have to be concerned about is my parents kicking me off.

Hi Reddit, I would love to have your advice on this to find out whether I am being too unreasonable/harsh to my father.

I (25F) moved out 2 weeks ago to live with my boyfriend and his parents, as my boyfriend and I wanted to take the next step in our relationship (cohabitation). I informed my father of this 1 month in advance and promised him that I would visit once every 2 weeks. Although he took the news badly (he didn't talk to me for the entire month and when he did, he said that I was unfilial, cruel, and that I didn't love him anymore). Nonetheless, I figured that he would cool down in 2 weeks time when I came to visit him.

When I visited him 2 weeks later, it was an absolute disaster - he (a) shouted and screamed at me for not asking for permission first before moving out, (b) called my boyfriend names like ""motherfucker"" and ""bastard"" (my boyfriend wasn't there but this is still immensely disrespectful), (c) threw a coffee cup and broke the coffee table in his anger, and (d) requested for me to call him FIVE times a week. I eventually compromised and said I will call him once a week (on top of visiting once every two weeks).

I feel really, really anxious and uncomfortable at the thought of having any contact with him, but would like to know if (a) I am unreasonable for doing so and (b) if doing so would not be unreasonable, what would be the best way of reducing contact? My mom is still married to him and still lives with him, and it breaks my heart to feel like I am leaving her behind in his house to suffer with him and his temper.

520,Is it worth it to talk to my (22F) doctor about a problem I think I know the cause of?,1180jvd,"(Adding details not really for an armchair diagnoses, just for context): Basically I've been sleeping a LOT lately- I'm writing this at about 5:30 AM because I fell asleep at 6:30 PM last night and just now woke up. For the past week or so it's either been fall asleep in the very early evening, have a nap between 2-3 hours in the middle of the day, or push through with a super painful migraine that makes me irritable, low energy, and basically all the things you feel when you're sleep deprived.

HOWEVER, I'm fairly confident that the whole reason for this is because I have a really poor diet (hello broke college student) and so I don't know if there's any benefit to telling my doctor about it bc I feel like she'll prob just tell me to eat better and exercise more (which, fair). So how do you know what issues you should bring up with your doctor? Is it worth it to schedule a whole appointment when I'm 99% sure I know what she'll tell me?

Edit: Woah, didn't expect so many responses. I should've known the only thing Reddit loves to do more than analyze people's relationships from AITA posts is to give out armchair diagnoses üòÇ But straight up, thank you everyone who's responded. I agree with you all- it seems obvious in hindsight, but there's no way this amount of sleep is solely being brought on by my diet (mostly fast food and the cheap stuff they serve in the cafe). My diet hasn't changed that much in the past couple weeks, so there's no reason it should all of a sudden be affecting my sleep now (thanks to u/Deipnoseophist for pointing that out). Also thank you u/mynameisabbie for pointing out the obvious... if this were common for all broke college students then no one would ever make it to class! **So long story short, yes, I have a doctors appointment in the first week of March.**

Quick rundown reactions to some of y'all's comments: I do have insurance, I'm just still not used to making my own doctors appointments yet lol. I had blood tests done last summer and the only thing out of the ordinary was low Vitamin D, I've been taking supplementals or it ever since. I have an aunt who has hyperthyroidism, so it's definitely possible- I'll bring that up with my doctor specifically when I see her. I do also drink a lot of caffiene, and actually now that I think about it I think I'm drinking more this semester than I did last semester, so that could also be related. Definitely not pregnant (like DEFINITELY lmao). I live in a dorm on campus, so I would be very very shocked if it were carbon monoxide if only for the fact that tons of people here would be feeling like this... if it is, then catch me on r/legaladvice to see how much I can sue my school for lol.

Thank you all for reminding me to use my common sense!

521,Update: Dreading Visiting My Parents,11887uo,"I am the redditor who wrote [this post a while back](https://old.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/112kb2v/dreading_visiting_my_parents/) and I thought people may want an update now that The Visit is done. We saw some sights, ate at tourist-y places, and got on each other's nerves less. Most importantly, I said everything I needed to. I realize I'll always want more time with my parents, but at least I have not left things unsaid.

Here are things that helped: tying activities back to my parents' memories (my parents went to the same university so we watched that school's sports team play on TV,) helping Dad get more comfortable using mobility aids (I bought him a cane. He doesn't like using it, but he DOES like the special treatment and preferential seating he gets at venues. Ditto his handicapped parking placard. A more mobile Dad meant we could see a bit more on our trip,) and redirecting conversations when they veered onto morose topics.

I realize that my parents now are not who my parents were when I was a kid. It's inevitable but still painful: I want to still be able to go to them for advice or to have a sympathetic ear, but I'd just end up having to explain a lot and confusing them. 

I also realize that having strict boundaries around how often I see my parents and how long those visits last is a good thing. I think I'm done with traveling in order to see them. I think from now on I can instead travel to a place near them (like if there's a concert I go to that's near their house) and meet up for dinner or something. 

Finally, I realize that what my parents say and what they do are different things and that isn't my problem. If my mom swears up and down she wants to go visit Wyoming or Canada but constantly delays or cancels plans to actually do so, it's not my job to make a trip happen. 

TL;DR -- I implemented boundaries that made this trip successful, but which left me feeling emotionally disconnected from my parents. I consider this both sad and inevitable, and will limit the time I spend with them moving forward.",thefirststoryteller,1,11,1.0

I live in a rental duplex in Tennessee. We‚Äôve had rainy weather lately which has brought this more to my attention. When we moved in there was a large spot sank in the bathroom floor beside the tub. Before signing the lease we addressed this with the landlord and he said that he would fix it by the end of the year. Well this all happened in November so I thought he meant by the end of December. Turns out he meant by the end of our 12 month lease. What rights do I have? Is he responsible for an inspection? Any concerns we have mentioned to him he says well that‚Äôs what you get for this price point.

My friends on the otherhand all have large sums of money. Think 1Mil+ just from inheritances or gifts etc. 

I am big on FIRE because I do not want to spend my life working and to keep myself safe if I ever lost my job or something. So to this effect I tend to save a lot of money. I still spend money on myself going out to dinner, concerts, whatever, but I keep a cap on it and dont spend more than what I have budgeted so sometimes I cannot join them when they go to 3 star michelin restaurants or go on vacations. I recently overheard them talking about how stingy I am and all I care about is money and how disgusting it is. As someone that has worked for every penny I have and does not have near the same amount they have, hearing this hurts. I tried telling them this and explaining that I do not have the same privilege but the one who said that I was disgusting got really upset and started screaming that they would rather die than be so focused on the material as I am and that twisting words like privilege for my own ends is harmful to people who actually suffer from not having privilege, claiming that this kind of language is fascist, and now refuse to talk to me because I resorted to right wing debate tactics.

What gives me comfort though is looking out of my massive window to the trees outside. When I sit at my desk, I can't see people or cars on the road, so unless there is an ambulance or something.

When I move out, I'll have 2 small windows instead of 1 big window. I'll also see houses across the street. That will definitely be an adjustment and that made me think about the many things that will change.

I'll have a neighbor that is like 80 years old and never makes a sound. If I don't turn on the radio or something it will be super quiet.  No more slamming doors, no more yelling, nothing. I think I'll finally have the space and the right atmosphere to do yoga or meditation without being mocked. My parents don't mind if I do it, but in the back of my mind, I feel like they think it's stupid.

Most important of all, I want to do things that make me happy and be the person that makes me happy.

547,How do I ask for mental health accommodations at work?,117j9nq,"There‚Äôs a TL;DR at the bottom. 

At my job, there is a day crew and a night crew. We all work in an office part of a larger facility, but day crew does most of the ‚Äúon the phone‚Äù people work, while night crew handles billing related functions. All of night crew is
part time, while a few members of day crew are full time. 

Recently, one of the day crew members quit. Their position is being replaced by one of us from the night shift, and since it‚Äôs one of the few part time positions during the day, our management has decided it will be filled by seniority rather than an actual interview. 

It‚Äôs between me and someone below me in seniority. That person will only get the position if I say no (although given what I‚Äôm about to explain, no one particularly wants to take the position). 

The newly opened day time position is at 
/least/, most likely much more, more than double the work. The day crew as well is made up of very catty individuals who always find a way to be negative/complain about their coworkers. 

I expressed interest in the position when the announcement was first made maybe 2 weeks ago, and since then, have only talked to my supervisor twice about the details after seeking him out myself. Everything Ive heard about the position has been gossip amongst the night crew, and I have found out lots about managements plans for me FROM THEM. The two subsequent times talking to my supervisor have been because Ive gone to them directly and forced them to communicate with me what‚Äôs going on/what their plans are. 

I sent an email asking for specific details that they did not respond to until I mentioned it in person (the response was a week and a half later). The two times my supervisor has talked to me have been after I sent the email. In the email I asked if there will be a pay increase‚Äî every other question was addressed BUT this one, and it was purposefully avoided in the two face to face conversations as well. 

Long story short: I‚Äôm getting the impression they intend to force me into the position without answering my questions/even discussing it with me. The last conversation I had with my supervisor I asked,

‚ÄúWill I get to talk to you before *date mentioned by supervisor that I‚Äôm ‚Äòsupposed to take the position‚Äô*?‚Äù

His response as, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôd like,‚Äù with a smile on his face. 

Are you kidding me?! There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm taking double the work, with a more hostile work environment, for the same pay. The position I have now is very cushy and I am very lucky. I even work at a similar time to my father, who occasionally will bring in food for me, so I seriously have absolutely ZERO incentive to take this other position. 

The only way I‚Äôd be willing to is if it‚Äôs a pay increase, or if they‚Äôd be willing to work with me and my mental health needs. I have CPTSD, anxiety, depression, etc from a very unsafe environment as a child, and bickering/arguing/hostile environments are a HUGE trigger for me. My bosses don‚Äôt know the specifics, but I‚Äôve already had issues with another extremely childish night crew member, so they are and have been aware of my sensitivities. There have been nights when things are so tense I have to make multiple trips to the bathroom in attempts to not throw up due to my nervousness/heart palpitations.

I have a feeling there is no pay increase which is why they are avoiding it. The only other way I‚Äôd consider it is if they give me more flexibility with my mental health needs, except I don‚Äôt really know what to ask for. Does anyone have any advice?

EDIT: I‚Äôd like to add, the woman who just left had chronic migraines and rarely came into work, so I do know there are accommodation options available. 

TL;DR: I think my employer is trying to get me to just ‚Äúgive in‚Äù to a new position with more work and less flexibility. They will not answer my question about if there is a pay increase, so I want to ask for mental health accommodations instead. What should I ask for?",jtaliax,2,5,0.78
548,I haven‚Äôt had a working fridge all month,117un37,"I‚Äôve only ever lived in apartments and rent houses with appliances included.

It gets delivered here and I notice, after a couple of days, the stuff inside isn‚Äôt getting cold. The top freezer works just fine, but the fridge itself isn‚Äôt. After they had it delivered here, I purchased a warranty. So, I called the manufacturer and had them send a guy to come and fix it. It takes them a few days to send a guy out here, just to look at it and see what‚Äôs wrong with it, and then another two weeks to send the guy back to actually fix it.

553,Suing for malpractice/negligence?,117lq4w,"I posted in a legal advice subreddit, but I hope it's ok to post this here and get others' thoughts, too. Have any of you ever sued a healthcare  provider for negligence or malpractice? If so, what was your experience like and did you have a favorable outcome?

I injured my right pinky finger while making a jackolantern on Halloween and underwent tendon repair surgery 10 days later. The orthopedic surgeon's PA refused to refer me anywhere for physical therapy except for the place that is ""partnered with"" their practice and in the same building.

I asked to be referred elsewhere and, when refused, felt I had no other choice. I have been diligent about going and have seen little to no progress. It basically amounts to a therapy mill where there are at least three of us - and sometimes four - at a time with little one-on-one assistance from the therapist.

After seeking recommendations from friends, I found another physical therapist and was able to get someone else with the surgeon's office to refer me over and send over my paperwork week before last.

At my second post-op follow-up appointment last Monday, the PA was suddenly far more accommodating when I said I'd switched physical therapists and said she would write up a prescription for another 6 weeks of therapy with the new therapist and printed off the surgeon's notes for me to give the therapist. That step was unnecessary, as the new therapist had already obtained all of that paperwork by fax and email.

I was never given a copy of the surgeon's notes at any point after surgery and, in reading the copy I was given last week to bring to the new physical therapist, I discovered that he removed one tendon in my finger/hand during the repair surgery. I was never informed by him or any of his staff prior to surgery that removal of a tendon was a possibility, nor was I ever told afterward that it had been done or given a reason as to why. I am assuming and the new physical therapist suggested that it was done because the tendon was too damaged to repair.

Because a tendon is missing, that means I will never regain full, normal use of that finger again and cannot bend the first joint and very tip of it at all. The bending also seems to be limited to the one side of my finger, presumably due to the other side tendon being missing. It is, in my non-healthcare professional words, messed up.

I knew going into the surgery that the recovery would take time and a lot of PT and that that finger/hand wouldn't be as strong as it was before, but I had no idea of how limited things would be or that a tendon would be removed or had the possibility of being removed. I wouldn't have known that it was removed either had I not read the surgeon's notes from last week that I was told to give to the new physical therapist.

I am beyond upset and angry that the surgeon and his PA failed to inform me of this possible outcome and failed to inform me afterward that he had to excise a tendon. Are they not legally required to inform patients of every possible outcome and obtain their consent for something like this? And if it's a case of not knowing they'd have to remove the tendon until they got in the operating room, are they not legally required to inform the patient afterward of what was done and why?

They failed to inform me either way and I am angry. Do I have any recourse? How should I handle this going forward?

In the meantime, I did a ton of freelance office assistant work on commercial sets, etc. I was working at least 12 hours a day, usually closer to 14, hated the work, and was making okay money ($3-$5k/mo). It sucked in many but my drive to reach my dream kept me going.

Towards the end of that time, I had periods where I got some really great gigs and eventually saved up enough to stop doing assistant work and transitioned into editing and some other freelance work to fill my time but wasn‚Äôt really working full time. 

Then, last year, I finally reached my goal of directing commercials. I had a 6 month run where I made really good money, loved what I was doing, etc. I had to drop a bunch of my freelance gigs to take on the insane workload. 

All of a sudden, my directing work dried up and hasn‚Äôt picked back up. I‚Äôve spent the last few months scrambling to get any freelance gigs back but most of my previous clients hired on full time staff to fill what I was doing. I‚Äôm making really shitty money right now and having to budget to insane levels so I don‚Äôt run out of money. I can‚Äôt take something traditionally full time because if I get a directing job, I basically have to drop everything I‚Äôm doing and go all in. Because I‚Äôve spent so much time on my directing career, my other skills are definitely lacking so it makes finding work really tough. 

I feel like I worked so hard for a certain lifestyle and had it for a few months just to have it taken away. I‚Äôve been extremely depressed and can‚Äôt see the light at the end of the tunnel here. If my directing career doesn‚Äôt pan out, I‚Äôve got nothing beyond slightly less than mediocre skills and no motivation to do anything else. I‚Äôm currently doing about 25-30 hours a week but I‚Äôm barely making ends meet and doing the work is like pulling teeth. Has anyone experienced this or have any advice?",Jschwartz567,1,5,1.0

568,Is going back to college my only option to learn about business?,116t7b1,"
I love learning and I think right now, I would learn best with other people who are learning as well and with access to a teacher or mentor to ask questions to. I‚Äôm hesitant to go back to college, because the first time around didn‚Äôt go well at all for numerous reasons, and I also can‚Äôt afford it right now. One of the issues I had in college was that for a good majority of the 4 semesters i was there, I was being taught things I already knew and I got bored very quickly, all while not really knowing what I wanted to do. Right now the two biggest things I want to do is to start a clothing brand and to have a music career. You could say my overarching goal is to be creative and make money while doing so. What I do know is that if I want any of my ideas to be successful, I need to understand business and learn how to run my own business. I know there‚Äôs lots of free information out there in books and on YouTube, and I have watched videos and read several books, but honestly the sheer amount of information that there is is kind of overwhelming and I don‚Äôt know where to put my focus. So my question is, am I just going to have to suck it up and go back to college, if so what should my major be, or is there another way I can learn these skills that I lack right now and retain them so that actually move me towards my goals?

TL;DR: I want to learn about business and how to run my own business. I would rather not go back to college because the first time didn‚Äôt work out, and I trying to learn on my own also hasn‚Äôt been successful.

575,Social Skills Advice for Young Adult,116l17r,"
I am currently enrolled in a cohort-based web 3 course and I unknowingly asked an indecent question without meaning to.

And now, I don't to be there anymore. The host was supportive and didn't take the other meaning of the question. But, I saw he was irritated max but kept his composure.

I am super new to web 3 but still, I end up making gullible mistakes all the time.

I don't face difficulty in learning concepts and skills. But, with anything social, I flounder every time.

I am recovering from a chronic condition and there is still some brain fog. I was bedridden for 14 months after COVID and couldn't talk for 19 months owing to Chronic Granular Pharyngitis. After this, I struggled a lot even adding up words while talking/ texting or even walking or brushing my teeth. Everything was a challenge. And it is still somewhat difficult. I don't do my assignments with the same astuteness as earlier. I am better with my health now.

Being said this, I wasn't good with social skills ever.  Butt now I feel my brain works at a slower pace.  Also, I feel that now I  speak whatever I am thinking, which isn't the best thing to happen. Cause I don't think as clearly as I used to. And there isn't a filter on my mind now. I wasn't this crude with my words.


For context:In the web3 presentation, the host asked us to guess about the niche of a project which rug pulled. Most of us guessed Art based on NFT but the host said it's not. Then, I guessed Actors/Influencers which the host said is correct.
And revealed the actor's name.

I googled the actor's name and didn't find the actor's wiki. So, I asked about the same on the live Zoom call chat. It was some adult film actor and that's why no wiki.

In haste, I ended up making this blunder
And this isn't even my first one

For some reason, I end up making these mistakes.


For more context, I am grown up in a protective loving family. Most of my friends are over a decade old. I have always known most of the people I know.

576,[Long] Is it worth dipping into my savings in order to move out of my parent's house?,115wbrr,"I'm 31, so I know everyone is going to shit on me for being such a loser.  

I have about $100,000 saved up between high yield savings accounts, three Roth IRAs, and treasury bonds.  About $40,000 is liquid but the rest could be accessible if needed, is what I'm saying. 


My current income is about $1200/month doing a remote job that doesn't pay well at all.  The thing is though is living on my own would enable me to have the confidence and freedom to come and go for interviews and work, whereas living with my parents doesn't.  It's not necessarily helicopter parenting as it is an interrogation basically, so I just don't go anywhere.  I've left the house less than ten times since September.    I quit my previous job in September because the stress from that place and the stress from my parents got too much to handle.  I know that makes me a loser and I regret it every single day. The only good thing that came out of it was that it enabled me to get Medicaid and have health insurance for the first time in my adult life, and it has given me time to get a couple certificates in coding, which I'm terrible at, and HVAC, which I'm 80% of the way through studying.  Quitting that job didn't help mentally though because I feel like the biggest fucking failure for quitting and only making half of what I made there. 


Ultimately, I get it that it's up to me to stop being a piece of shit. I get it.  It's just hard when the only people I have any contact with are the people who basically don't want anything else in life for me. I missed out on an interview for a job I would have needed a degree for anywhere else just because my mom talked me out of going for it.  That job pays 4x what I make now and if I get my own place, I'll reapply. It's third shift, which wouldn't work living at my parents because they sleep about 15 hours of the day and me coming and going while they're asleep would cause problems.  


Basically, my life has been on hold all of this time, except for about 5 months when I was 21 and had moved out, because of living with them for the sake of saving up money.  They told me to live with them and save for a house instead of renting.  But when it came time to look at houses, they were no help at all and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing in looking for a house and have nobody to ask.  So all of that saving seems like it was for nothing since I doubt I'd even qualify for a mortgage at my income.  


So here's the monthly budget if I moved out:

Rent: $790 (monthly cat fee and renter's insurance included)

Car insurance: $90

Electric is the only bill I'd have to pay: $100 (total guess so let me know if I'm way off)
It's electric heat but I can just not heat the place because my cat has heating pads and I can live with the cold if I need to

Internet: $50 (another guess)

Groceries: $50

Cat's medicine/food: $50

Hulu: $1.99

Gas: $30 (I don't drive much and any job I get will be nearby. Usually I fill up about 6 times a year)

So, until I found another job, I'd have to dip into savings for maybe a couple hundred each month.

Every 4 months, my cat's vet appointments are $375 but that's something I have no problem pulling out of savings for.  Her medicines are about $300 altogether but I always get gift cards through rewards sites or sales to get them discounted so this isn't an issue.

Groceries are low because I eat 4-5 meals a week and fast the rest of the time. Living alone would allow me to fast more and have space to stock up on items when they're on sale, which I can't do now due to space. 
When I had my own place when I was 21, I didn't eat from stress and got down to about 90 pounds and would like to be in that range again.  That would be another benefit of having my own place.


My issue is that, while I feel like having my own place would feel like I've finally started my life at nearly 32 years old, I'm sacrificing financial security.  But at the same time, how long do I keep sacrificing having any kind of happiness for the sake of maybe owning a house one day?  With the rate I'm at, I won't ever own a house; I'll just keep telling myself to save for one more year and then start looking again but it'll never actually happen because I'll convince myself not to leave. There is a house that I like that's $125,000 and that's about my price range. It's just ugly as hell.",aunttjemima,47,24,0.73

581,How do you deal with parents with a victim mentality?,1163hmj,"For example, when I try to express to them something I‚Äôm struggling with, they take it personally and make it about them. Like I‚Äôll be going through something that‚Äôs very stressful for me and I‚Äôll try to express that to them in the way I know how, and they will then get mad at me for not handling it myself like an independent adult. Like they‚Äôll be upset I‚Äôm even opening up to them. Sometimes it takes me back to trying to figure out if I‚Äôve done something to upset them from before, because they seem like there‚Äôs some unresolved anger they have towards me. I used to be oblivious to this possibility, and just behaved in response to how I thought they wanted me to behave, which essentially was someone that was extremely unlikeable. Or perhaps they genuinely think I‚Äôm just not a good person. It can get very heated.

Or like my mom thinks for example, she never gets to speak and is never heard. As a result she will interrupt me incessantly or talk over me a lot. I‚Äôll get upset because of this and she‚Äôll then take it as me not wanting to hear her. I can‚Äôt nurse her to understand this as her daughter because that‚Äôs not fair to me. I hate having to explain this to her because she‚Äôll take that as me being a coach or guide for her, and she will act all satisfied about that afterwards.

I‚Äôm trying to place my finger on it and that it might be a victim mentality. How do you deal with someone like that? And if it‚Äôs your parent and you‚Äôre still trying to be an adult yourself and break out from them in a healthy way. Like I‚Äôm still living at home with them.

Thankfully I was able to pay it using some of my savings, but I‚Äôm upset that I owed that much. I‚Äôve never heard of a low income person not getting a tax return, let alone owing that much. 

I‚Äôll admit I made a mistake. I work remotely, and I moved states and forgot to let employer know for months. I didn‚Äôt know it would effect my taxes because because I thought you paid taxes based on where your employer was located. 

I ended up telling them, but didn‚Äôt tell them when I moved. I now know that means taxes were being paid to the wrong state. 

Here‚Äôs what confuses me though - I ended up owing the hundreds of dollars in taxes to the old state I used to live. That doesn‚Äôt make sense to me because for months my tax withholdings were going to them, not the new state. Interestingly enough, I ended up getting a meager tax return from the new state. 

I wonder if HR withheld the wrong amount of taxes from my old state. I haven‚Äôt said anything because I don‚Äôt want to have to admit my mistake and end up getting fired.

611,How to handle family member asking for money,113q4ja,"My husband‚Äôs family member begged him to ‚Äúloan‚Äù her a significant amount of last night via DM. This is a family member with a history of drug use, and this makes us pretty positive she‚Äôs back on drugs. She also doesn‚Äôt pay any living expenses because she mooches off of her mother (who she also has stolen from). Let me be very clear: We DO NOT plan on giving her any money whatsoever. 

My question is how to handle our response to her. To be honest, it makes me angry that she asked. It feels like she‚Äôs trying to take advantage of us, specifically my husband because he‚Äôs super sweet and caring. It just so happens that she messaged us the day she found out we were moving into a much bigger house too, so that makes me feel even more like she‚Äôs trying to take advantage of our new financial situation. We‚Äôve worked our butts off to get to this place in our life, and all she has done is try to mooch off of anyone she can. My gut reaction is to tell her off in response to her question, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the right route, especially if addiction is her issue. 

How should we respond to this request? Short and sweet? Empathetic to her drug situation? Maybe a little snippy so she doesn‚Äôt do this again?

ETA: UPDATE

Thank you all for such thoughtful responses! My husband decided he‚Äôs going to go the ‚Äúghost her‚Äù route, although I‚Äôd prefer the short and to the point ‚Äúno‚Äù response. If she begs again, we‚Äôll use my way. I‚Äôm curious if she will continue to ask. Also curious to see if she still will plan on coming to my son‚Äôs birthday‚Ä¶

He‚Äôs going to reach out to his mom to see if she can agree not to give her money and discuss what steps to take if his aunt is back to using. 

To those who are worried about security, I appreciate the concern and I understand it‚Äôs a very valid concern with drug related situations like this. Luckily, we live pretty far from her and she has a real crappy car, so that lessens the risk. I realize it doesn‚Äôt eliminate it though. We‚Äôll be extra careful, and yes, we do have a security system!

Mostly, I realized I have to have compassion for this person, even though this does frustrate me. But y‚Äôall, it‚Äôs so tough. I have dealt with a couple addicts in my life, and it‚Äôs so hard to see where the personality ends and the addiction begins, ya know? In my opinion though, part of compassion for her is not enabling her.

633,What Do I Do When I Get Old? Get Sick?,1136963,"(please note I am not asking for medical advice for any specific problem. I am currently in perfect health - as far as I know)

Well,this is it folks, the big 5-0 is just around the corner.

I never thought I would make it this far. My best projections had me checking out around 2016.

I have mostly lived life with an adolescent brain and totally steeped in escapism. For some reason I was able to successfully maintain this life right into the present though I know reality can and probably will hit hard one day.

I have no kids, had one almost relationship in my adult life (at age 49), fewer friends than ever (they are dropping dead). Not much in the way of family anymore, they have all died, moved out of state, drifted away, alienated. Most of my friends are from my hobby so not much in the way of deep friendships separate though I have made some good ones. But yes, my whole personal identity is tied up in this too. 

Flunked / tested out of school and crashed and burned in community college so still no job skills and people skills are worse than ever. I hung on the same company for 22 years at barely above minimum wage because it was poorly managed and they didn't fire people and tolerated a lot and thus was very compatible with my lifestyle. I really lucked out with cheap housing here in metro LA, even now.

I have never had a drivers license. When I say adolescent mind I mean it. 

At some point I got into a pricing arbitrage scheme related to my hobby and I was suddenly pulling six figures for a few years in a row before it unraveled last year. Most of these pricing gaps and opportunities have been closed off. Still living the minimum wage lifestyle with a pathetically impoverished roommate but the money won't last forever. 

No game plan for eventually getting a job and acting like a responsible adult.

No game plan for what to do when I finally need to look for housing again. I might be able to afford to buy a house - somewhere, but I need things in walking distance so maybe not. 

No game plan for when the inevitable health problems creep in. I do not have health insurance and I haven't been to the doctor since 1992. Thankfully no major accidents or health problems, that I am aware of. This is partially because I didn't want to spend money best directed to my hobby (life), and later on became a strategic form of slow motion suicide that would also help close the gap as I figured once I hit that brick wall of reality, I would rather put the lights out then live any other way. This was kind of my insurance that perhaps natural causes could take care of it. 

This is the big one, what do I do when I get sick? No one to help me when I get way too old. I tried to be nicer to my somewhat orphaned nieces in another state but I think it ended up just being awkward and I don't even try anymore. I think they hate me.    


I do exercise and eat healthy so I don't need advice on how to keep illness at bay. Unless I get hit by a car or stabbed at a bus stop I absolutely will get seriously ill some some day.  Current issues that would interfere with future employment is a lower back issue for 16 years that prohibit standing for long periods of time as well as a blown out right ear which makes interpersonal communication and phone work increasingly difficult. And of course whatever mental issues I have been feeding and avoiding for decades.

So why am I having a mental break down?

Shamefully it all because am just really fking scare that I can't even be a reliable adult soon. I feel like I still a fking baby need to rely on my parent just to survive.

Just graduate a with a CS degree in this horrible job market.

So I moved back to my mother house in Vietnam.

Primarily cause I have no more money to live in USA anymore and by the time I got on the plane I have only like 12$ left on me.

Now I just at home..... trying to study but couldn't cause I feel so...dumb and unmotivated

I applied to so many company here, only 3 got back to me here and even with help from relatives, nothing.

I got 1 interview from a small startup here and got an internship position that last 6 months.

But the internship will only pay me $150 per month. And idk if this will even help me advance my career. 

When I told my mother (who been paying my school tuition all these years) about the position. She tried to sound neutral but I can tell she was fairly disappointed in me. Imagine invest thousand of dollar for your son to just get a ""job"" that pay $150 a month. That's pretty much minimum wage for Vietnam.

It must be so hard for her to not compare me to my older sister. Who's super smart and making ridiculous amount of money the moment she graduated. Her career keep getting better through out the years and heck she have enough to retired in 3-5 years. She like the opposite of me, smart, successful, she amazing at communicating, even with her broken English everyone adore her.  My family try to remind me to not compare myself to her, but how can I not.

One other big thing that been gnawing a me is that I have 0 motivation in achieving anything in life. I don't have any dreams, ambition or any form of goals. I feel so lost and useless. I have very little friends also. Currently only 2 that I speak a bit to but no one I feel like I can share much to. I'm just really bad at making friends and talking to people am not close with.

I know that I'm one of the lucky Vietnamese that got the chance to move to US early on, study there, graduate there. Heck even in Vietnam I don't have to worry about rent. But that just make me feel even more worthless, even with all of these opportunity given to me, I felt like I wasted all of them. And every night the thought that I have disappoint everyone in my family just grow and grow and it really shutting me down.

tl;dr:  I feel like an privilege brat that wasted all the opportunity given to me, have massive inferior complex and can't handle the stress feeling very pathetic.

640,Dreading Visiting My Parents,112kb2v,"I (34m) am seeing my parents (early to mid 70s) this weekend. I'm pretty much dreading it. 

This isn't new. I've dreaded visiting my folks more and more as time goes on. The vibrant, happy, energetic couple I knew from my childhood have turned into unhappy, nervous, boring people. I do want my parents in my life. But I also don't want 3 hours of conversation focused around death, crime, or other unhappy topics. (They watch a lot of news, and US news sometimes tends to emphasize lurid or negative headlines. If it bleeds it leads.)

Yes I still love my parents. Yes I still call them, visit them, text often. Yes I know a lot of this is aging. Yes I've suggested therapy for them and that got my invite to last Christmas revoked, so.....yeah. 

One parent sleeps, eats, and watches TV. That's the three things they do most every day and it's tough to get them to travel or do anything outside of that routine. The other parent constantly makes plans, backs out at the last second, talks about how lonely they are, but never makes plans to see somewhere new, visit relatives, or try anything outside of their routine. 

After one or two days seeing my parents I can feel myself get more negative and close-minded. My parents used to get tons of physical exercise, they traveled numerous times a year, they were active in their community well past their respective retirements. And then.....something happened. It's like a switch was flipped and my parents became the exact opposite of the people I knew. 

I spoke to my sister and my aunts and uncles. Everyone agrees that my parents just...declined? Gave up? I don't want to be rude but that's truly what it seems like. I spent about 2 years trying to talk to my parents about it, I even planned 2-3 family trips, paid for them all, and then my parents canceled due to vague worries about crime (once), not wanting to be away from home if someone calls even though both of my parents have cell phones (once), and not wanting to leave their routine. 

This weekend happened because my sister and I basically forced my parents into it, but I'm already seeing myself trying to find ways to minimize time with my parents. 

Just typing this out makes me think that it's time for me to call it quits. Yes I'll still text and call, but I may have to be done trying to visit them often and planning trips with them. If they really wanted to travel--they would. If they won't, then I'll share travel photos with them once I get back.",thefirststoryteller,51,110,0.95

As said in the title, I landed my first job and needed some extra directions as to what to do next.

For context: I'm 22 and live in a third-world country where jobs are scarce. After High-School, I followed an online course in a field that's reasonably needed here and gained quite some skills. After some time, I started an internship at a company and they decided to keep me with a nice salary increase.

On a personal level, I live with my parents and I pay some of the bills, yet it still leaves me with a nice margin at the end of the month. Having that extra cushion is nice but I'm not sure if the way I'm planning on leveraging it is correct.

My main goal is to be at the top of my field. I don't want to focus on the money right now and regret it later when I stagnate in my career. Improving is key, and I have to do everything to make it happen

My plan is to keep doing what I did to get there. Study some advanced materials, broaden my understanding, and just get better. I want to do a better job, and also become a better coworker, so I'll need to eventually train those soft skills.

653,Trying to make friends after being on the move for years...advice?,112d5jj,"Hi, 30M here, for the last few years, I've been trying to figure out who I was and what my values indeed were. Before the pandemic, I was happy because I thought I had everything in my life stable - friends, work, activities, etc. That said, due to it, things changed drastically, and I had to start over completely. It's the longest I've ever stayed in one area, and now I'm questioning if that was the right choice.

While I have gone to therapy, the main thing I feel that I've gotten from it is my constant need to reset my life in the pursuit of greener pastures. This makes me feel whole, but ultimately ruins many of my relationships. In nearly every situation in which I have had a particularly large negative experience, my response has always been to move away and start anew. This has taken me very far away from home, and while I have many acquaintances, I have no one to share any long-term memories with for the most part. On paper, this has been really great for my life, but not so much for my emotional health. Since the pandemic, I haven't been able to move, and now I'm starting to hit a wall. I'm not sure how to make long-term friends and I worry quite a bit about bothering the few friends that I already have (*near and far away*). Plus, in speaking with my old friends, I wonder if it was ever right to move away.

Lately, I've been trying to go back to school with the goal of making friends, but my S/O is understandably adamantly against that. This is mostly because the programs I am picking are in areas that they have never seen me express interest in ever, but in reality, they are areas I've been too embarrassed to explore before. Either way, I've always been the ""adoptive friend"" and I've always struggled to make friends on my own, let alone maintain them. I was hoping that entering a cohort of sorts may help with that, as my intention is to make friends this time.

As far as other things go, I have tried to make friends through other means, such as sports, gaming, food, work, etc. but in every single instance, I find that I feel extremely out of place amongst them. I'd assume this is normal, but I find that in doing this, I am becoming shyer and shyer around others, which is something I never thought myself to be. I feel like I'm giving up on being sociable because while I know what I want, I'm not 100% sure how to get there, or if the ways I am trying are the right way to go about it.

Recently it's gotten worse though, as I've had to set a boundary with a coworker who lives close by that I carpool with as they often bring up racially charged topics, and I find their opinions of them troubling (not going into all of that in this post but basically they are racist). In response they have decided they won't be driving me anymore. I respect that decision but it still makes things challenging.

I have always disliked the environment at my work, it feels very clique-y and exclusionary which made me feel unwelcome in the office. This has been made worse by my aforementioned coworker not really talking to me anymore.

I do not have a car and often take the bus, which is an hour and a half both there and back, which takes up too much of my time. When I first was hired I was told that working from home on some days would be an option, but that seems to be frowned upon, and it is also difficult to work from home because of work server connectivity issues.

I also feel like there is zero opportunity for growth or advancement for me in this company. My skills have stagnated because of how dull and rudimentary my tasks are, and I do not have the energy or motivation to pursue personal projects after working 8 hours and commuting 2-3 most days. I worry that I will not be able to get a new job in the industry because it is constantly evolving and I am stuck in this dead end job.

I want to bring up issues like this to my manager, however they have shown a lot of instances of having poor emotional maturity, and has publicly reprimanded me for a misunderstanding of unclear expectations in the workplace. Because of this I frankly have trust issues here; I worry that my concerns will only open me up to resentful comments.

The straw for me lately was that I have been moved from having my own office with a door, to having a makeshift office in the corner of the lobby. This was to accomodate a new employee. This would not be so bad, except it is the second time I have had to move offices to accomodate someone new in the span of 6 months, and now I have been downgraded to essentially a cubicle. It shouldn't be a big deal, but it is always me who needs to move to accomodate new workers. This makes me feel undervalued at work.

All in all, I do not like the work environment, the commute is challenging, and the work itself is both unfulfilling and has roadblocks to getting it done efficiently. The only thing truly tethering me to this job is money, and even then I do not make enough to be able to support myself should I move into my own place. Rent has risen drastically in Nova Scotia where I live, and inflation has made groceries and other necessities more and more expensive.

I do not need to be completely fulfilled at my job, it can be a means to an end. But it is making me feel terrible and I actively dread going every day. 

I have nothing lined up which makes me nervous about leaving, but I need time to find another job and work makes it difficult to do so. I am fortunate enough to live with my parents, and pay them a bit of rent each month to help them out with expenses, which I am more than happy to do. 

If I do leave, I will not be on the streets, which I am aware is a priveleged position to be in. All that is to say I have a fair bit of money saved up should I be out of an income, but I do want to return to the workforce as soon as possible should I leave my current job. Even a retail job part time would suffice for a bit until I can find something more consistent.

Regardless I still am torn on if/when to leave without something lined up. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",strangestbeard,4,7,0.79

I come from a culture/religion where the focus is always on, and has always been on, getting married before 25 or at 25 & here I am, 25, and completely unsure about my future.

659,How do I file taxes if my boss never sent me the year end W-2 tax information?,111us8s,"US based tax question:
At the beginning of 2020, I worked for an insurance agent for eight months. The agency shut down due to something the agent had done, knew was wrong, and the parent company terminated his license to deal their insurance suddenly. I had to throw out anything with company branding on it that day before I left the office. After that, I heard from him only once, when I asked for my W-2 in February of 2021 as I had not received it, asking he forward a new one to my new address. 

Since then, I haven‚Äôt filed taxes and I‚Äôm trying to get my life back in order. I know it‚Äôs been two years, but the whole situation has increased my anxiety and I‚Äôm working through therapy.

Pros:
Get to move out of parents 

Already have a friend group, don‚Äôt need to try to make friends.

The friends will introduce me to new people (I‚Äôm thinking specifically about meeting a partner, or just new good friends)

We have similar interests.

get to live in a big city be exposed to more,lots of things to do.

Better job opportunities.

CONS:

Friends are a little shallow.

They tend to be catty and mean.

I feel like I have to keep up with them and maintain a cool and confident vine at all times.

Lots of drinking and eating out. (Also a pro a little bit but they party a lot)

So now I've gotten a ticket for speeding as well as having expired registration plate and expired vehicle inspection and my address changed when I moved here two years ago and I never notified them.

The advice I've gotten from multiple representatives of the state is to order a duplicate license, go to the license plate agency and get a temporary tag, then go to a mechanic for the inspection, then go back to the plate agency for a new plate. Once I've gotten all of those ducks in a row I have to appear in court and let them know I took care of my registration to drop the charges and then I just have to deal with the speeding ticket. Is this solid advice? Is there a more efficient way to take care of these things?

683,"My high school friend, who I have been friends with for 20 years, wants to end our friendship. How can I accept this loss gracefully like an adult?",110ab1e,"My friend from high school who I have known for past 20 years sent me a text yesterday saying that she can‚Äôt continue our friendship any longer because of my tendency to go silent when I am uncomfortable about something. In my opinion, we are good friends, but not the best of friends. She lives in a different country than me. She brought up a few events that happened to her last year that she says I was absent:

1. Losing both her parents 
2. Being unemployed twice
3. Me suddenly asking to borrow money from her when she is unemployed 
4. Me not wishing her happy birthday and forgetting the date of her birthday 

For context, let me explain where I was last year 2022. I, too, lost employment in late 2021. I then slipped into deep depression and was clinically diagnosed. I am on medications now but starting the medications in the beginning was tough - they made me loopy and at some point even more suicidal. It took me many months to be able to get used to the medications and connect with anyone again. At this point I have not been working for 6 months. 

Since I didn‚Äôt want her to worry, I made sure to inform her about my diagnosis and how I am so out of it sometimes that I don‚Äôt even have the energy to talk to people. I did that because we are good friends. I did not tell anyone else about my diagnosis & struggle. She seemed understanding of my situation. 

Now let me explain my absence: 

1. I did not know about one of her parents passing. She did not inform me. When her parent passed, I found out later that it was during the period where I was in throes of my depression. When she lost her first parent (before I fell into depression), she told me about it and I asked how she was doing. 
2. I did not know about her being unemployed twice. She did not tell me about it until months later. When she was unemployed the first time, I was there for her. Her second unemployment happened after I was in my depression.
3. I came to her for help with finances because I was scammed of 10k while trying to get on my feet again after being jobless for 6 months. At that point I have exhausted my savings and on top of that I lost 10k to the scammer. When I asked for help she did not say she couldn‚Äôt help. I did give her an option to say no because she was also struggling. I gave back all her money and some extra one week after she lent me hers. 
4. When her birthday came I was deeply depressed about my situation (work, scam, depression) that I missed to wish her happy birthday. I know her birthday- I did not forget- but I was so down. 

We have been in contact recently but it feels different. I have been helping her to find a house because she‚Äôs decided to come back to our home country. In fact, I found a unit for her in my building. I have been helping her landlord to resolve some issues with the house, receive furnitures on behalf of her, etc. Last week she sent me some pictures without context, and when I asked what they are, her reply sounded upset that I don‚Äôt understand. (If you haven‚Äôt notice already, my friend has a tendency to expect people to understand what‚Äôs going on with her without communicating directly. In my opinion, the onus is on our own self to communicate what‚Äôs happening to us/inside us. We cannot expect people to understand.) So I was a bit frustrated with her reply and have been a bit distant. I still reply to her, but they were short. She asked me what‚Äôs wrong and I told her about my frustration and that I need some time. This is where she said she wants to end the friendship since I tend to go ‚Äúradio silent‚Äù on her.

It breaks my heart that the things she brought up are from when I was unwell with depression (still am depressed but better controlled with medications). But at the same time, I am aware that I was not there for her.  I have invited her to talk face to face about this but she isn‚Äôt responding. I don‚Äôt want to force her if she‚Äôs made up her mind but I would be lying if I say I am not sad, upset, and angry. So, how do I accept this gracefully? What if I bump into her in the lift?

689,when to pay for others when you're out?,110bnun,"i'm 18, just context for this early-adult post :) 

i just got back from hanging out with a friend, and I've been covering both of our food every time we've gone out, this is the third time. This time, I could just sense she was just noticing it, but I'm not sure what she was exactly thinking. 

She's a good new college friend, and a large part of her paychecks (she works a lot) go to her college tuition,, both her parents are in deep debt, she always talks about money scarcity with her, steals things, etc. 

I pay for her because, *I* have a friend who literally can just swipe her dad's card (they have money), she doesn't work at all.. can go out for lunch whenever, etc, it's normal. We'd go to a lot of places and at one point I had to awkwardly (awkwardly because of me, I've gotten better tho) be like, ""I gotta slow down with these lunches out""

I understand the feeling when a friend who has more money/doesn't care *takes you* around, and *your* money is ""worth more"" than theirs to you,, and it's just an awkward situation to stop the flow of the hangout and say, no I don't want to get food out. 

Ag anyway, I do feel really bad, because this friend hadn't eaten all day (which she does when she's home from college, idk why), and then ordered just fries at a food truck. I thought maybe it's because she doesn't want to spend a lot, and I know she hadn't eaten all day, so I was like, ""I'll pay, what do you want?"" and she was like no no i want fries, even though i kept pressing her, because I wanted her to just eat food. I don't know. I feel weird about it, because literally every single time I've paid for her shit, and then she was like, ""I'll get us a drink then"" and paid for that, I think because she felt this weird thing that I was and have been doing. I feel like an asshole

The thing is I don't have to pay for my tuition, and I have extra money to spend on things like skateboards and clothes and whatever.. it makes sense to me to pay for her. But I understand that that may not be the point? I don't know

693,Setting boundaries - how much is too much?,110a3os,"My dad was emotionally absent throughout my upbringing and did not act as a positive male role model for me growing up. He and my mum constantly fought and argued which was extremely stressful and I had to convince her to leave him a few years ago during a tearful Christmas when I returned from university to visit. As a parent he looked after my physical needs well (quite generous with money, etc.) but was hypercritical about everything. He was never flat out abusive but had a pretty short fuse, was unpredictable and a source of constant negativity. 

Fast forward to today, mum is in a long-term relationship and the three of us live together, everything is very stable. My dad lives in a dodgy flat in a nearby city and is predictably still extremely negative and bitter about the world. I visited him during the most recent Christmas and was quickly reminded why we left. 

He claims he has nobody else and clearly wants to insert himself back into our lives, when I‚Äôbe asked about his plans he always says he wants to move closer to us which personally I‚Äôm completely against. He messages me pretty frequently, sometimes its a proper message - most other times he writes one of my childhood nicknames with some emojis, or sends some pretty dumb TikToks that he finds funny. I‚Äôll always respond if he asks a question or says ‚Äúhello‚Äù, but otherwise depends how I feel. 

Lately I‚Äôve just been ignoring a lot of the random crap and he seems to be upset about it as he sends some frowning or crying emojis. I try to keep our conversations as short as possible and don‚Äôt provide too many details. My thinking is that he never cared much to know about me or mum when I was growing up, so why does he deserve to know so much now?

694,"I‚Äôm having trouble hearing in my right ear, but the ear doctor said my hearing‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm confused.",1107q8c,"Whenever I use headphones, I always have to adjust the left/right stereo balance to be right of 50/50. Otherwise, I almost can‚Äôt hear anything on my right side. Also, I often get tinnitus in my right ear. This has been going on for 2 years, and recently, having finally turned 26 and gotten my own health insurance, I went to an audiologist to get it checked out. 

Now, aside from the headphone problem, I‚Äôve also had to adjust the left/right stereo balance when listening to stuff on my computer without headphones at close range. Additionally, when I cover my ears with my hands and hum, I hear it better on my left side, which I read somewhere is a telltale sign of sensorineural hearing loss, so for a while I was worried I might be suffering from it and might need a hearing aid. 

However, when I went to the audiologist, and took hearing test, the results came back and said that both my ears hear equally well. Not only that, but my auditory comprehension of different words is 100%. Thus, the audiologist said my ears are probably just full of wax and recommend I clean them out with warm water. 

I got the same result when taking hearing tests via apps on my phone, but I didn‚Äôt take them seriously because it‚Äôs just an app on your phone. Surely it doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story, which why I was shocked to get the same result from an actual ear doctor. 

Then again, my hearing is my right ear, though never as good as my left, goes up and down in quality, aka it‚Äôs gets worse then better then worse again. For example, at the start of January, I was comfortable with a left/right stereo balance of 25L/75R. Then by mid January, it improved to 48L/52R. Now it‚Äôs back to roughly 25L/75R. Also, when I put my fingers in my ears and hum, my hearing is more balanced than when I cover them with my hands.

I am 21 right and will be entering University next September at age 22. No matter how hard I try not think about it / think about it positively I can‚Äôt help but feel like a looser about it.

I know that it is too late and I should think about the future and not the past, but when I think about the future all I think about is the fact that no matter how hard I study during the next years, no matter how hard I try to correct my past mistakes, it won‚Äôt change the fact that I will be graduating at age 26, and that thought makes me feel like shit.

I have always been a very competitive and ambitious person, I had everything to succeed, but depression got to me and Basically wasted 3 years of my life.

I will be 22 studying with 18 years. I will graduate 3 years later than people my age. And I can‚Äôt do nothing about it. 

People say age doesn‚Äôt matter and what not, truth is it does. People in my class will look at me weird, I will still be in university while my friends have graduated long ago and are making good money, women my age will not date because will still be a student at the age of 26, my parents are ashamed of me because I had everything to succeed and didn‚Äôt.

That's double what Kelly blue book says it's worth so I'm going to try to bring it down. My selling point is I'll buy it outright. Im thinking I'd be willing to pay 4-4.5k at most.

How do I negotiate?

Also, what do I look for in the car? I don't know anything about cars. My plan is to take it to a mechanic right away if I do buy it for an inspection, then return it in the return window (my dad says there is one) if something is majorly wrong.

I don't even really know basic things, but I plan on reading the manual and youtubing things like oil changes. Whatever a car needs.

721,process server job... scam?,10ytwme,"So I recently got an email from a guy after I posted a job wanted ad on Craigslist. He said that he had work for me as a process server. He said that the work would be limited to my area and to call him, so I called him and he explained that I would need to get a license and that it would cost me about $300. Sounds legit, honestly. I know that process servers have to have a license in order to do their job. 

But then he says that I have to buy a printer, that he sells these printers, that I'm going to go through about 2,500 pieces of paper per week printing from home, and that I'll be needing to buy a toner as well. He calls all of this ""overhead."" 

He then goes on to badmouth one of his employees and basically say that the guy had the audacity to ""ask for more money"". He tells me that the employee in question is working around 4 hours per day and that he's getting paid $500 a week. And that I would be replacing this guy.

I'm thinking (with the sheer amount of paper that this job seems to require their employees to print) that I seriously doubt it's just 4 hours per day (because organizing all those papers would take time, too). 

Anyway, I haven't heard anything back from the guy since our phone call. I suspect it's because I wasn't sounding too enthusiastic, but that's okay. I'm kind of thinking it's a blessing because honestly looking back on what he said, sounds like a bit of a scam.

She is not the recruiter that I've been communicating with. This recruiter is starting to get on my nerves. They emailed me letting me know they were interested on the 30th of January. I responded the following morning. They asked for my availability for an interview, which I gave to them. I did explain that I'm currently working 2nd shift. I gave them 3 different dates/times this week and I said I'd the available at any time on the 6th 7th and 8th (I was using my PTO those days). Again, this was on the 31st so it's not like it was last minute or anything. She did not get back to me again until the 7th, and she said the interview would be on the 8th at 12:30 PM. I was annoyed about this but I promptly responded that I was excited for this meeting. I got ready and at 12:15 I looked back at the email for the Zoom link. I realized that I had a missed email from 11:30 AM where she said the person I was supposed to meet was out sick and they had to cancel. They said ""we'd have to meet tomorrow at 11:00 AM."" I told her that unfortunately I work 2nd shift and I'm not available between X and X on weekdays. I let her know I could probably deduct my hour lunch from the start or beggining of my shift to make more availability if those times don't work for you, so please just work with me. This again annoyed me because it's exactly what I said on the 31st. She just assumed I'd accept her time and date with less than 24 hours notice. At my current job its just a couple of us left but the workload is the same, so it's really difficult to just take off like that. It is the 10th and I havent heard anything. For all I know, they waited for me to show up at 11:00 AM on the 9th. There's a phone number in the signature on her emails. Should I just call her, or would that be unprofessional?

730,How to know when to go to ER?,10xkb7s,"I've gone to ER 2 times in the past 2 years. Both times I have been reassured that my issue isn't important. Sometimes the nurse that does the first check up in ER will say to me ""it's (insert problem)"" and look at me with this stare as if I'm supposed to know what that is at 21 years old. I know it must be annoying for them to have patients like me that aren't on the verge of dying and don't know about all these illnesses but how am I supposed to know? I've been told I can't google symptoms cause the results won't be true. So how do I know?

The first time I went to ER I thought I had a heart attack. I was at home, working on my PC. I stood up, got horrible chest pain, couldn't draw a breath and almost collapsed to the ground. I held onto furniture and walls walking to my mom's room saying something isn't right. That turned out to be my first panic attack.

The second time I went to ER because I thought I was having kidney issues which came out partially true but I still got criticized for coming. I had pain after urinating, so strong that I was shaking. I also had a fever, lightheadedness, urgency, back pain, strong urine smell, blood and blood clots in my urine (not on period) and shortness of breath. I thought it would get better but it got worse. I couldn't even sit, lay down or sleep cause I had to go to the bathroom non-stop and the pain was so bad. I went to the ER and they looked at me like I was crazy and peeing blood clots isn't a big deal. Now I know it's not. It turned out I had a bladder infection and fluid in my kidney. They asked me why didn't I go to my GP but I just can't get to my GP that quick. I already registered for a GP visit but it's a week away and I thought it might be something more serious. How could I have known it's just an infection?

I know I'm in the wrong here so I want to be better. How do I know when to actually go to ER? Btw, it's useful to mention that in my city there is no urgent care, just ER and GP.",R34LZ,112,166,0.98

On paper, it sounds like everything I wanted in a job. It's a purchasing assistant, starting in at $41,000/year, which is more than I've ever made and would finally be enough to live on my own.  In a way, I was relieved not interviewing there because it's a very intimidating place to visit because it's a meat packing plant and you have to go through security and find an unmarked door and hope you have the right one and it's just kind of an overwhelming experience on top of already being stressful enough because it's a job interview.

The bins were being kept on the neighbours drive which is at the end of the row of houses, they are the only ones with a driveway out of this block of buildings. 

Ever since they posted us a letter asking that we not access our own bins after 8:00pm as it sets of their motion detector alarm, we decided to move them to where the rest of the houses keep their bins. Where they would be is on the small sliver of land that is part of our home at the front of our house. They wouldn‚Äôt be on the pavement or in anyone‚Äôs way, and would only be two extra bins in the line of already existing bins.

749,Military rejected me (19 M) and now I'm getting kicked out of my house in three weeks.,10wmla4,"A little back story, fresh out of high school, I've been trying to get into the military for about the last year and a half, It was drawn out for so long cause they wanted to know my entire medical history from birth (I had childhood asthma) while I was waiting I was and still am working a full time job making around $18 an hour. I never really saved a significant amount because I believed that any day now I would get a phone call from the military, drop everything, and leave. But today I realized that will no longer be the case, I got a long awaited call from my recruiter saying that my asthma waiver had been denied. 

The reason I wanted to join the military in the first place is because I feel that I have no idea what I would like to do in the real world so I figured some real world experience might help me develop some semblance of what I wanted to do with my life. 

My dad has always been someone who see's the world in black and white, and he absolutely cannot be reasoned with. We've clashed heads all my life and have merely tolerated each other. He's always been very adamant about me needing to go to college but since I had no idea what I wanted to do I decided against it, and figured that I should wait until I knew what I wanted to do so I didn't waste upwards of $100,000 on a degree in some field that I realized I hated later down the road. 

But anyways, he's been telling me it's time to ""leave the nest"" for over a year now, I didn't want to get an apartment cause I thought I'd be leaving for the military. But now that I just learned I'm not, he told me this evening that I have 3 weeks to pack my things or else he would have me ""forcibly removed"" (no joking lightheartedness here). But now I am absolutely frazzled, I have a barely functioning car, $100 to my name, and absolutely no idea what to do next. I make about $1300 a paycheck biweekly, to survive i'm feeling that I need so much more than that, can I afford a car payment (My car barely gets me from point A to B), insurance, (oh yeah he's kicking me off the insurance too) and also an apartment? I've been wanting to learn how to code but I don't want to do it out of the back of my car.

TLDR: Military doesn't want me, Dad is tired of me living at home so I have 3 weeks to get out, I'm 19 and have no idea what the hell I do next in life. I am freaking out

Edit: Here are some common questions/concerns about my situation.. I‚Äôm am a 19 year old male, currently in Fort Worth, Texas. I tried it enlist in the Navy and the Air Force but was rejected both times. The problem that prevented me from getting a waiver was that I have a caring mother who refilled my rescue inhaler prescription every year, so on paper it looks like I have asthma when in reality.. I have not used an inhaler since I was 13. I have submitted a pulmonary function test but they did not budge. I have not been paying for rent for the past year but it does sound like a great idea to offer that in exchange for more time to get my sh*t together! I‚Äôve always been interested in IT work, I have family out in Phoenix Arizona who have offered for me to come out and stay with them while I go to school, I think I will start looking at community college/ general education options out there and see if anything looks promising.

At my current job I‚Äôm now getting talked down to by bosses I liked at first. They seemed very nice and now they‚Äôre short with me, have an attitude and yell at me. I‚Äôm still fairly new. I  hadn‚Äôt done anything intentionally to get under their skin. I‚Äôve recently started talking with my coworkers about how I‚Äôve been feeling. Now I feel like my boss is doing everything they can to micromanage me and jump on me for any reason they can find. 
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being dramatic. Some of my coworkers feel the same way I do and they have been here longer. A majority of them plan on leaving and have applied to other jobs. I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I really need to work.

752,My dad didn‚Äôt tell me that our car insurance expired in November. What do I do now?,10wzz41,"Pretty much the title. My dad told me a few days ago that he stopped paying our car insurance back in November. I had no idea that I‚Äôve been driving this whole time uninsured.

It makes me so angry that he didn‚Äôt think this was something to tell me. He just hid it and didn‚Äôt answer me directly when I asked him about it. Now that it‚Äôs been months, I don‚Äôt know if my license is suspended or what. I can‚Äôt get any continuing coverage discounts. I can‚Äôt reinstate my old policy. I might have to pay fines to the DMV. If I am pulled over I could get arrested. And I had no idea. I‚Äôm sick with anger.

I‚Äôm in the state of New York. I have a perfect driving record. I am 24 years old and male. Progressive quoted me over $500 per MONTH for insurance if I just had myself on the policy. I make $2200 per month. I cannot afford to pay nearly a quarter of my income for car insurance. I am so scared I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I know that adding my dad to the policy might lower the monthly payment because he‚Äôs a more ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù driver. We technically don‚Äôt live together but share a billing address because I moved out recently. Both our names are on the car, so I think I‚Äôm required to add him anyway. I just don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm so overwhelmed and he‚Äôs so dumb that he doesn‚Äôt understand how serious this is.

I filled out the Progressive form on their website where you get quotes, and now I have to send them pictures of the car and pictures of my registration. The lady on the phone was very nice and said they would ‚Äúwork with me‚Äù to make my payment as low as possible. But is there any way I could get car insurance TODAY for cheap?

what else should I do once I turn 18? and for the future, what other tips do you have?


financially, is there anything I should do(planning to get a job over the summer for the first time. so what would I do for that?).

No relationship, no place of my own, no good job, no degree, I've never been out of the state, hell I have probably only left my house less than ten times in the last six months.  The next time I'll leave the house this month is to take my cat to the vet on the 13th. Before that, I went to a store once in January, once in November, and the vet in October. That's been my only interaction with the outside world since September.


I was doing a retirement calculator yesterday and it got me thinking: what am I saving my money for when if my life stays like this, I don't want to live.  Even if I somehow became able to afford my own place, it feels like it's too late to meet a guy.  I've passed my prime in the gay dating scene. And I can't even consider a relationship until I have my own place anyway. There will never be a 30th anniversary or anything like that at this point because it would be such a late start. I had dreams to turn my writing into tv shows and movies but more realistically, all I wanted was to be loved and married and have a place of my own that isn't my childhood bedroom. 


In September, I quit my stressful, low paying job ($32,000/year) to do a stress free, very low paying job from home ($13,000/year).  Neither paid enough to live in my own anyway so I figured why have I spent the last 9 years at this place just to not be able to afford to live?
This low paying remote job has allowed me time to get certifications in coding, digital marketing, and right now I'm about 70% of the way through an online HVAC certification.  But in reality, I know when I finish that, I won't have the courage to interview for jobs because I'm afraid to be the new person.  That's why I stayed at my old job so long.  No good jobs are located around me and I can't drive more than a couple miles because I'm too anxious. The nursing home right across the street from me is always hiring maintenance technicians but I had interviewed a few years ago and was told they primarily hire women. 


Everyone on here always recommends therapy and I don't even know where to start with that. Since quitting my old job, I became eligible for Medicaid again after not having insurance for years. So I suppose I could see a doctor but I don't even know how. I never have in my adult life. And what's the use anyway? It wouldn't change anything. It feels like life passed me by and I was on the sidelines the whole time, too scared to join in and now it's too late to.  My whole life has been a waste and me being gone would make absolutely no difference to anyone but my cat.

782,Musings of A 23-year-old man,10wa2se,"Hey, going to be a long story, I will leave a TLDR at the end

I  was born in a small town in India; my father was a government officer,  mom was pursuing her higher education to become a teacher. I was put in a  convent school where I was bullied and sexually molested by my  classmates. I stopped going to school, and pretended to have an illness  where I'd fall unconscious. I faked it everyday at school to save myself  from the kids.

My mom left her  education that she was pursuing in a city some 8 hours away and came  back to take care of me. I used to get beaten up a lot by my parents as a  child for running from school. However, my parents put me back in my  original school which was a small school, run by RSS (an Indian  nationalist organization that I do not support by the way) and everyone  knew me here.

This is the part  where I mention, I was always good at academics and topped every class,  even at the convent I'd score very high in mathematics but not in other  subjects because I didn't understand the English there.

I  got back to this school and things started getting better but I  realized that as I was growing up, me and my mother grew very distant.  When I was 11, I came 2nd in my class for the first time and then I  turned 12 and me and my parents got very distant. I'd always get into a  fight with them, realizing that no matter what I do, they are never  happy with me, always disappointed. However, I started studying  seriously at this point and topped my class.

In  9th grade, I started seeing some changes in myself. I started getting  tired, mentally and physically. My grades dropped, so did my aptitude  and everything. I went to the doctors at a government hospital but no  lock. The private hospital doctor gave me some medicines but my parents  being as neglectful as they were, didn't take me there for subsequent  check-ups, claiming that ""it's all in my head and I have always been a  weak kid"".

I started getting very  bad anxiety, depression, and sleeplessness, my weight fluctuated quite a  lot, from heavy to super skinny, I started getting acne. My family  never really cared to get it checked and to convince Indian parents  about this was impossible. In 10th grade, I missed the district merit by  quite a few marks and everyone was out to get me, from classmates to  teachers to parents, everyone blamed me for my downfall, not knowing  that I was self-harming because I could not understand what I was  feeling (I have cuts on my left arm).

I  found a girl online after 10th grade from Kolkata and got really into  her. Coming from a boys-only school, I didn't have much experience  talking to girls and this felt magical. We became good friends, started  sending couriers. She was 2 years older than me and she had failed 12th  grade. She came from a humble background, lived in a chawl-like place,  father worked as a computer repair man at a small store, mother was a  housewife. I really loved her a lot. I was a Hindu. She was a Muslim.  Her mother knew about us but always thought it was only me, however, we  were in a relationship. We used to exchanged birthday gifts, she didn't  have the internet other than 2G so I used to send her videos on  pendrives/DVDs which we used to watch together while on call.

I  loved her a lot but her relatives wanted her to marry a guy. Meanwhile,  she passed her 12th grade and went to a local college under Calcutta  University. I came to 12th grade. Now, her family started taking her  phone away because of which we could only talk at night when she'd sneak  into her dad's room to take away her phone. I used to go to school,  come back and sleep the whole evening to stay up at night and talk to  her.

Overtime I started getting  very insecure about her as she used to talk about how she thinks she'll  get married, mention guys and the vulgar things that they said to her  (which I think she liked as it appealed to her sexually). It would all  sound roses till now but I had started understanding that she was a  control freak. If a girl talked to me outside, it was hell, but if she  hung out with a guy alone after college, it was understandable.

Anyways,  my illness got very bad to the point that I contemplated suicide  everyday (I sometimes find old notes/diaries of mine talking about  killing myself). I started digging into it and realized I probably had  gastritis which prevented me from eating well, or digesting the food due  to which I was suffering. Apparently, eating fibrous fruits helped it,  so I took an orange from the fridge, ate it, and realized, it was true.

Started  going to the doctor alone since then, we changed like 3-4 medications  over 2 months. I started getting better. Although, I screwed my boards  and JEE (engineering entrance exam). My dad hated me for this and wanted  me to drop so I could join an NIT/IIT (top Indian engineering  institutes), but I was never someone who was crazy about  tags/brands/money.

I joined the  gym in the summer vacations after my sister's recommendation. Meanwhile,  the girl broke up with me because I couldn't be there for her because  of my illness and was talking to her to-be-fiance while we were  together, for months without telling me. I am not sure what she does now  because she isn't active on the internet too much and last I checked,  she worked as a freelance writer. I feel bad because I don't think her  education has paid off well.

I  attended a private engineering college where I started recovering, had a  girlfriend, joined a kickboxing gym, got a belt, started coaching kids,  even coached them during a tournament, started performing at local  cafes (I rap). Life was good.

I  had another girlfriend during this time, call her J, whose father barged  into my residence one day and warned me to stay away, so the girl broke  up with me. I went home 10 days later because of the pandemic where I  got passionate for lifting. I started with calisthenics and improved my  physique a lot. Meanwhile, the girl and I got back together. Not to  mention, I was a top student at my college, and always helped my girl  with her academics, even during the pandemic. Going ahead, I randomly  sat for an MBA entrance in India, cracked it and joined one of the top 3  MBA institutes in the country. Unfortunately, my girl had planned to  get a Master's in Engineering and she couldn't crack the entrance. She  finally managed to get into a top private institution but our paths  diverged.

I came from a small town  and was blinded by the city and the kind of crowd that came at the  institute. A girll, call her L, fell in love with me here (acc to her),  got very close to me, I made a mistake and cheated on J. J found out and  was heartbroken, and shamed me so much that I lost most of my friends  (which I deserved). J also gained weight, is not doing too well with her  career (although seems very happy according to my friends, probably  because she has her father's business). I wanted to push away L from my  life but she didn't and overtime, I started loving her a lot. She  literally became my family (more so because I am not close to my real  family).

However, MBA is about to  be over. We are getting companies coming here for placements. L comes  from a much stronger academic background than mine, along with good  workex at the Big 4. I have no workex as I came directly after  engineering (you can do it in India). Although, L always claimed that  her academics at MBA suffered because of my presence (I didn't do  anything to distract her), because she was always insecure that I'd find  someone else (but I literally never told her that).

Yesterday  was very tough, as the market is very bad, L appeared for interviews at  top firms but couldn't get any offer simply because the market is  horrible and companies are rolling out very less offers. I, somehow,  managed to get an offer from the Big 4 (she was targeting much better  firms than what I got) in the evening. I came out and everyone was  hugging me and congratulating me. She was also scheduled for the same  firm and role. I saw her coming towards me and ran to her to hug her,  but she pushed me away and started asking the HR to schedule an  interview for her. I thought she is just upset.

She  didn't get a schedule because the hiring requirements were fulfilled.  We all came back, people were very surprised that I managed to get  placed during this horrible time (with no brand whatsoever on my CV, I  guess I was lucky). I, along with a friend of L, tried to ensure her  that she'll get a better offer this week, we created a whole strategy to  help her through the process.

Everything  was fine, L lives with me and I requested her to sleep last night so  she could rest for the coming days, while I stayed up the whole night  preparing HR questions, completing her assignments/tests given by the  recruiters, slept at 6AM and woke up at 8:30AM (I haven't slept in days  because of the recruitment process), shot a video for her, slept again,  woke up to checkup on her. She couldn't get through a process today  simply because her background doesn't fit.

Anyways,  we were sitting in the afternoon when she suddenly started crying and  left the room. I was very tired and fell asleep after a few minutes of  texting her what's wrong. So I haven't left my room since 3 PM and it's  midnight, I was asking her if she needs help and what's wrong. The  mutual friend isn't replying as well.

She  texted me back that she knows why she didn't get the offers. This is  referring to how she has often told me that I am the reason for her poor  academics which are leading to this. But to be honest, I never intended  for that. In fact, so many times I have actually sacrificed my  work/studies to be present for her, way more than what she's ever done  for me.

I don't know but this incident is making me feel that I keep doing better in life while everyone around is doing worse.

Oh,  and I called my father last night after getting an offer from the Big  4, where I will be a consultant with a team and all. He asked me how  much I'll be making and sounded a bit disappointed that I didn't opt for  another high-paying company (because I believe that in this bad market,  it's less important for me to get a better job/salary than my peers  getting jobs). My sister said that she is extremely happy for me, and I  shouldn't think about my father's response because he is comparing with  his friend's daughter who makes more than 3x of what I make (she's 7  years older than me and we all know how inflated CTCs are in the  corporate world).

I feel like  everyone dislikes me due to some reason. I have friends who have always  supported me, in everything, they are literally the reason that I am  here today but recently I found out that my mom hates me a lot becaues  my father had her leave her career to look after me, she never wanted  to. I haven't talked to my mother in almost 2 months because everytime I  called her before that, she'd be busy and put down the phone in 30  seconds (she doesn't know about my girlfriend, my friends, what I study,  where I will be working, or anything). I don't call my father because I  feel burdended by his never ending expectations even though he cares  about money and I make more at my internships/will be making at my first  job than what he makes at retirement at a good position in the  government. I really admire my sister and I am hoping she gets a job  soon so she can be independent as she's been living with our parents  since quite some time.

Other than  this, at MBA, I couldn't make much friends because of L and because she  didn't feel comfortable. The limited friends that I made, are just as  one would expect at a top B-school, often greedy, selfish and  treachearous.

I sometimes feel  like every person in my life has just been ruined by me, be it my mom,  my college ex or L. I really hoped that my father would be proud that  his son managed to get out of a small town (I went to a very small  school that only has 250 kids from nursery to the highest grade with  abysmal facilities) to working for the Big 4 for my first job. I  wouldn't be surprised if I am actually the first one to work at this  position from my town.

I never  backstabbed anyone in MBA, never was a sycophant, never made friends  with powerful people for perks and always put in the work wherever I  could. I have had sleepless nights, working 36 hours with minimal breaks  and what not so at least I always hoped that once I get a good brand on  my CV, everyone will be proud of me, and I never really chased  validation from my father, but at this point in life, I feel like I  deserve at least a little.

TL;DR - Mother hates me for having to leave her career for me, ex hates me for cheating, current girlfriend sort of dumped me because I got a job offer when she was the one most likely to (she was expected to get a better offer, she unfortunately got none, I got one at the Big 4 which isn't what she wanted), father is disappointed that my job doesn't pay too much (I make more than him, he's retiring soon, I am starting my first job), and I feel tired.",goddawg912,0,1,1.0

I was not officially evicted, though. They just told me to leave ASAP and I was out the next day. There was no notice, paperwork, or fees. They said ""just leave now and we'll forget about all previous agreements."" I'm staying with friend while I find somewhere else to live, but I'm not sure how to approach applying for apartments when I have to give my renting history. Do I leave it out or will the background check bring it to light? What do I do about the 2 month gap between when my previous lease ended and now? Should I send my landlord a notice for early lease termination? But that would require a 30 day notice and I would have to pay rent for a month that I'm not even living there.

I‚Äôm just feeling like, why am I the way I am, and am I truly changeable? 

I think I‚Äôve gone through life being a people pleasing punching bag. My mom is the same way, so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs learnt behavior. Though, I have always been a bit more confident than she is. I don‚Äôt mind conflict‚Ä¶as much. I don‚Äôt mind conflict as much but don‚Äôt like when I‚Äôm the subject of it and need to stand up for myself and stand firm. I get insecure. I self blame. I feel bad about people not liking or agreeing with me. I want everyone to like me. I‚Äôd always like to be agreeable. Or maybe I always want to be right so I don‚Äôt look bad. It‚Äôs very weird because I feel like I teeter very much between not giving a damn and giving a huge damn. What is that? Why is that?

I‚Äôm about to be 34. Woman. Single. No kids. No career. Overweight the majority of my life. Only thin once while a teen and starving myself. This is when everyone liked me and I felt most confident, even though I was acting like a dipshit most of the time. I guess that‚Äôs the privilege of literally fitting in? Idk. 

There are people who are my age. They have a steady career. A home. Are married. Multiple kids. And these are things I wanted for myself at this age, or thought I would have. But I got sick at 26. Undiagnosed autoimmune. And was crippled for five years until being diagnosed. My entire life spiraled out of control. I went from a college grad to being homeless from being unable to work and no one helping me. It‚Äôs been the most traumatizing experience of my life, and I‚Äôm coming out of it. Being treated. Have a diagnosis. I‚Äôm incredibly lucky for all of that. But it took five years of my life away from me and has led to more insecurity than ever. 

I screwed up at my new job. Not totally. I am a top performer there. I do good work. I am mostly professional. But for a lot of the time I wasn‚Äôt professional (saying too many jokey things. Acting sort of obnoxious. Helping other co workers with things when I should have just been minding my business, like acting as if I knew what I was doing. I did. But I shouldn‚Äôt have been butting in and speaking up so much ‚Äî wasn‚Äôt my place) and definitely made bad impressions with people I did not want to make bad impressions with. And it makes me hate myself. 

When I was sick, in the depths of it, I hated my whole life before. I didn‚Äôt like the things I did. The friends I had. The way I acted. The way I let people treat me. Idk. Maybe I‚Äôm still doing it. Still trying to please people who do not deserve my pleasing them. Maybe I‚Äôm still living in a way I shouldn‚Äôt be living at all. Unenthusiastically. Dumb job. Wasting my potential. 

How do I completely change my life? I already have started. I disconnected from people who made me feel bad about myself. Even family members. I moved further away from them. I live by the beach and love that. But I want more. I want a better career. I want a home and a family of my own. I do not want to look back at my life and STILL be filled with regrets over my choices.

We missed the connection by 2 minutes.... Ran exactly from the end of one terminal, to exactly the end of another. Covered in sweat and not happy. Wish us luck.

Shout out to corpo greed for fucking around and letting us find out. 

There were too many airplanes landed at SFO, so we ended up waiting at LAX for an hour on a part of the tarmac that even the pilot had never seen before lol. 

Update 12 hours later: 
It ended up being a nice side adventure! So we went and talked with customer service for 2 hours and killed her with kindness, and it really paid off. 
Some other people that were doing the same connection as us got boned until tomorrow, but our lady pulled through and got us a new flight for today on another airline. She's a real champ. I gotta say, the people out here in San Fran are REALLY nice!! We went and got a rental car, and the guy even upgraded it to a mustang convertible, that was really something. 

It sucks that we lost a day, but we ended up crossing the Golden Gate bridge for the first time, ate some good food, and met some real nice folks so it was definitely a win :) 

We're about out of here finally, thanks again everyone!

It's just dawned on me that I am nearing 30 and still sleep with essentially a teddy bear.

Should I try to be more adult and stop?

816,Tips on staying warm in an apartment without heat?,10tm16p,"The heat in my studio apartment is broken and has been for a week or two now.

The electric heating is the only available heating in my apartment.

I live in Ontario, Canada, so in other words, it is *really fucking cold*. Especially with the recent < -20 temperatures outside. I'm layered up at all times which works fine for the most part, but my hands are constantly freezing. I can't really wear gloves all the time because it makes it impossible to get anything done. Is there anything I can do / invest in / etc to keep warm?

I also feel I should clarify that I am working to fix my anxiety issues as best as I can but it's hard without being able to afford therapy. I'm on medication for it which has been helping but as you can tell there's still a long way to go haha

822,How do parents find time for hobbies or projects?,10twun7,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for a question like this, but here goes...

I'm a father of 3, been married for 16 years, and we live in a fairly small house on a somewhat limited budget. Our oldest is 15, middle is 12, and youngest is 6.

I'm wondering how other parents find time for hobbies and/or projects. I feel like I only ever get a couple of hours to myself at a time, maybe once a week, which isn't really enough to accomplish anything in the grand scheme of things. I end up with a bunch of half finished projects that I eventually abandon because we get too busy or I can't afford it.

I need to work on my car and get it running, but it would probably require an entire weekend (16-20 hours) and doing it in small chunks isn't really an option. By the time I get everything set up and I remember where I left off I only have about 30 minutes to do actual work. We don't have a garage so I'm working on it in the alley behind our house, so leaving my tools set up and the car in pieces isn't an option.

I'm also a musician and when I have time I like to play guitar or write songs, but I never get around to learning new material or recording ideas because I run out of time before I get to it. If I don't record ideas while they're fresh I won't likely remember them next time I pick up the instrument. Again, since we live in a small house I can't really leave it all set up. I have to clean it all up when I'm done because much of our home is shared space in one way or another.

Those are just 2 examples, and it seems like there are countless other projects and activities that I want or need to do but I can't find the time or money. How do you other parents do it?! I know people that have kids and work full time who somehow have time to build amazing things, create art, spend meaningful time with their family, go to the gym, garden, and still keep the house clean.

834,Possible Sublet Scam‚ÄîNeed Advice.,10tgj5d,"**Not sure if this is the right sub to post this. I know this is a long post but thanks for reading. Any advice is greatly appreciated.**

I (24F) recently had to put my apartment up for sublet due to financial reasons. I posted in several FB groups advertising. 

Someone (will refer to her as K) reached out via phone call (Feb 2-Thursday) and claimed they are a parent and are looking for an apartment for their daughter. K claimed that they have a son living at the complex and already filled out an application for the daughter but no units were available.

K asked when the lease starts and ends (Jul 2023-Jul 2024). K offered to pay the 23-24 lease in full ($12,060). K claimed to have a stipend that was expiring night of the phone call (Feb 2) and offered to pay the remainder of my current lease ($5874). Final total of $17,934.

I was told that in order for K to pay I would need to provide my login information to my resident portal so they could add the method of payment to my account. (I know very stupid of me to do that). I did delete all my payment methods before doing that.

The payments were broken up into 4 and I received e-receipts for them. As of now I can still see the credit balance on my account. When I went to look at the stores payment method the bank account K added was a Varo Savings Account and she had put my name as the account holder. I don‚Äôt have a Varo account at all. This is part of the scam I‚Äôm guessing.

K then asked me to send over half of Feb rent which is $489. Asked me to send through CashApp but that wouldn‚Äôt work. I then said I have Chime and K said her husband did as well so I stupidly sent it through there.

On Friday, Feb. 3, I was asked to send K an additional $2459. I told her I don‚Äôt have that kind of money right now. K asked if I knew anyone who could loan me the money. I told her I don‚Äôt know anyone who could loan me the money.

Due to my financial situation I offered a payment plan to pay the $2459 by May by paying $600 in February and $783 a month March-May.

K didn‚Äôt like that. K claimed her husband said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs too far out‚Äù. K said she (and husband) can‚Äôt wait until May for me to pay. K asked once again about getting a loan from someone. I asked when she needs the $2459 in full and didn‚Äôt get an answer.

At this part I was confused cause I really don‚Äôt remember anything about a down payment. K then said that me paying 75% of that was the ‚Äúcorrect amount for the down payment‚Äù which is $735. I was asked if I could pay $246. I offered to pay next week (Feb 8) cause I won‚Äôt get paid until then. They said they want the $246 that day (Friday, Feb 3).

I refused and stated again that I don‚Äôt have the money and already sent them all I had (like a dumbass). I didn‚Äôt receive a response after that. I then called my mom and she said it‚Äôs probably a scam and that the payments will bounce. My mom told me not to respond until I informed my apartment‚Äôs leasing office.

I met with the office and contacted the accounting department. The accounting department said to change login info and to not send them anymore money as K can dispute the charges with her bank and keep my money. Also suggested to get a full name and see if they started the relet process.

I sent a follow up text to K stating that the best way to contact me is by text and that I‚Äôm unable to send anymore money until next week. Also told her that if she wanted me to I can send over her name and email to the leasing office to get started on the relet paperwork.

All of Friday K kept calling but I was too scared to answer and only felt comfortable communication through texts. Plus my mom said not to answer after I sent that last text.

Come Friday evening K sent a text saying her husband said if I paid $100 today they can move forward with the payment plan I told them. I didn‚Äôt respond to that. Then she sent a text claiming that her husband wants to press charges to get their money back cause I haven‚Äôt been responding.

After that text I called my mom crying and told her about the text. My mom said that I‚Äôd trying to scare me into sending her more money and to just ignore K.

I think this is a scam and I‚Äôm very worried. I got excited that I potentially found someone to sublet so I wasn‚Äôt thinking straight. My mom says that the money that was paid is going to bounce in a few days since it was a large payment.  Now I don‚Äôt have money to pay Feb rent on time and I feel like an idiot for doing this to myself.

I know K initiated the payments cause she added the bank account but I know I have some blame to this. I did reach out to Varo bank and explained the situation and asked if there‚Äôs anything they can do.

Do y‚Äôall think this is a scam? Or is it legit? Any advice and/or opinions are welcomed.

Most of the job offers I've gotten have been out-of-state meaning I'd have to move away. In theory I would love that.

Still, I'm worried that I'll feel even more alone in a new place and I'm not sure if I'm capable of being on my own.

I'm not sure if I should get a part-time job while trying to start a side hustle/business by freelancing on fiverr, starting an etsy shop, or any other type of online or in-person business or just do one or the other. My question is, what is some advice or ideas for me to start making a revenue? If I should just focus on getting a part-time job, what are some jobs that I could start with? If I should start a side hustle, what are some small businesses that I could probably start?

Sorry guys: addendum.  I‚Äôm not feeling top notch currently so I didn‚Äôt add any supporting details.  

But to the women who were in these military relationships regardless of being divorced.  Even if they divorced did they do their wifely duty by supporting the military men?

EDIT: thank you guys so much for all the answers! I'll get done with the rest of my errands and then head to laundromat. 

I am autistic so going anywhere new on my own is extremely terrifying to me- particularly the thought of going to the laundromat.  

I have not washed any of my clothes since December because I'm too scared to go. I need to. While I am very good at hygiene at home like showers, etc my clothes are now way too far gone to ignore. 

1. Do I bring my clothes in a hamper or bag? 



2. Do I need to bring my own detergent? 

3. When I walk in, what do I do? (If someone could explain the process in detail, that'd be great). Do I go straight for a washer? Do I go see a worker desk person first? 


4. How do I pay? If it's coin laundry, how many coins of what kind (U.S) do I need to bring? Do I pay with a card up front? 


5. Any non-obvious dos and don't? 


6. Do I need to stay in front of my machine the entire time?


7. Can I go to my car and wait alone while it washes? Is this not ok?

The house is a great price and everything looks almost too good to be true.

The house comes with a stove and fridge, but if the house is being converted do we need to get new ones? Also, the house is older (like 1900) and there are some old-fashioned vents in some of the walls. There seems to be a modern HVAC system on the house now, but do we need to do anything with those vents or system if we got everything converted to electric? Finally, are there any questions that I'm not thinking of that we need to ask the agent? Sorry if this is a lot.

41,I (21F) Am Leaving My Parent's House Soon,119009c,"I'm packing my things and will be staying with my girlfriend and her family. I'm deciding to leave while everyone is my house is working, and to leave a note behind, only because I've constantly been talked against moving out of the house and my parents will do everything in their power to prevent me from doing so. They very strongly do not want me to leave. My mom has had many talks with me about the negatives of being on my own, renting, etc. (as if she thinks I believe doing so is a walk in the park, I DON'T). Ever since I began to think about moving out, I gave myself realistic expectations. I value my freedom and that's what I'm want to achieve, however I realize the self-sustainability that accompanies such a decision. I have to look out for myself.

Why am I choosing to leave? For quite a few reasons. The main one being that I don't have much freedom living with my parents. They decide how I'm able to see someone. It's not as easy as telling them where I'm going and who I'll be with and walk out. I did that on Valentine's Day to spend time with my girlfriend, and when I got home I got confronted and screamed at by my parents. Unless I do it behind their backs, I can't see my girlfriend or go out with her unless she spends a few days at the house and makes my parents feel comfortable with allowing me to go on dates with her. They have to feel comfortable. Even though my partner and I have been going out (on dates) without my parents knowledge for over a year now but they have been made aware of this recently (last few months). Everything I do has to be made known to them and they have to have approve some aspect of it.

Another big reason why I've felt pushed to leave is due to the affects on my mental health caused by my parents. I have anxiety and I'm currently receiving treatment for it. My therapist has even recommended I put myself in a better environment. They have been the underlying cause and ""trigger"" to my anxiety due to how they raised me. My parents didn't psychically punish me as much as my older sibling, but whenever it happened, I felt such extreme fear, shame, and guilt. And that has carried onto me as an adult. Recently we had a serious discussion where I touched on this with my parents, and they surprisingly made an apology to me. I suspected they're trying to keep me from leaving by finally mellowing out, but it just feels too late. I feel like my relationship with my parents will only improve if I don't have them helicoptering over me. 

Another push: My privacy has been constantly invaded. I got a car a few months ago. My parents were not happy and my mom was demanding to see my documents for it. I denied that to her. My mom has gone through my receipts, my mail (that I have not seen), a bank statement, my wallet, and even a journal where I was talking about my girlfriend. Now, my partner is trans (not transitioned or out), so since I was writing about her as a woman with her chosen name, my mom therefore asked me if I'm gay (I am), but I was NOT ready for that conversation. I was also not about to out my partner. So now she suspects our relationship is some kind of cover up for something else since I didn't confirm or deny anything.

I expressed to my mom that I was hurt she went through my things and that it was an invasion of my privacy, but all she kept reiterating is that it's her house, her room, and she's a mom so she has a right to go through my things in order to find out what's going on with me (since they see my actions as rebelling and as direct attacks on themselves) and that I was lucky I had a parent who was never going to give up on them. 

I'm worried that once they find out I'm gone they're going to blow up my phone and even try to come after me. I already feel a lot of guilt leaving my family because of how worried they're going to be. But I don't intend to go NC with that at all. I intend to tell them where I am and to reassure them that I'm safe. 

I'd really appreciate some encouragement and/or advice. I've been very fearful of change, but this is always what I wanted to do, and I have a right to do so.

Edit: Thanks very much for all the comments!! I appreciate the support. Just so you all know, I did end up leaving my parents house yesterday. So far I have felt such a huge weight off my shoulders. I spoke with my therapist shortly after leaving and I feel very reassured by my choice due to her encouragement, my partner's support, and of course all the comments I've been reading here. 

Also I understand the concerns some comments had about staying with my partner's family. My wording was a bit off, but my current situation is that I am staying with my partner and her grandmother, not her parents, siblings, etc. Her grandmother is a very nice woman who is happy to have me. This isn't a permanent thing as we're merely trying to save up more money to get a place of our own. The rent around here isnt too high so it won't be long before we're able to achieve this.",RanunculusRex,96,178,0.93

Kinda follow up to my post about a week and a half ago asking if moving out of my emotionally toxic *parents* house was the right call. ‚ú®It was‚ú®

I need a more experienced adult with an unbiased opinion.

My *PARENTS* are telling me that I can't go off the auto insurance plan because their rate and my rate will skyrocket. They're telling me not to legally change my address because I'll lose all insurance.

I feel like this isn't true? And I've heard a lot otherwise? Is this their way of keeping me close because they're worried about me cutting contact? Ultimately for those of you who have cut contact, was it worth it?

For the auto insurance the rate I was quoted was less than what I'm paying on a family plan. I'm sure I'll have to rate shop eventually but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

As far as changing my address, that doesn't default to kicking me off the health insurance right? I'm not yet 26 o the only thing I would have to be concerned about is my parents kicking me off. (I plan to grab health insurance through my employer when open enrollment opens back up, otherwise open to suggestions)

I like art and drawing and not just doodling, like doing figure studies and anatomical studies, color studies, etc. Progress is gonna be slow soon.

And lastly, staying social (whether online or in person) with friends, and watching shows as they come out.


I'm scared of losing the time I have to be able to work on all this. Especially since work can be so mentally fatiguing that I just won't have the energy to work on my art or language.

Like literally I cant make it start for the life of me (it works just fine, I am the problem). Just thinking about it makes me start to cry.

57,Is it normal to not really have a social life? Can I change that?,118ciij,"For context I'm a 31F, married, generally pretty successful and comfortable with my life.  I just have been really missing a social aspect of my life lately.  I miss college and the years just after where I had a group of friends who all lived locally and someone would always be around to go out or just hang around and talk.  Every weekend I always had at least some kind of social plan.  Everyone has slowly moved away since then, and while I do keep in touch with most of them, they're not physically close enough to hang out with without specifically planning a trip to see them.  I have a couple local friends still but they always seem to be busy between work, family etc.  If I just want to have a drink and a chat I need to give them like 2 months' notice.

There are some people my age or a little younger at work and I try to be nice/social but can't seem to graduate past just polite small talk.  A group of them sit together in the lunch room and while they've never specifically excluded me, they've also never invited me to join them so I feel uncomfortable inviting myself.  I tried volunteering, meetups, etc and they all eventually die off, or people don't seem interested in continuing a friendship outside of that specific setting.  Our neighbors all mind their own business and don't seem interested in anything past polite greetings.  It doesn't help that a lot of people my age are now having children and while I have nothing against someone choosing to be a parent, I don't have a lot in common with them and they become too busy to socialize with anyone who isn't also a parent with close-in-age kids that can play together.  My partner and I are not planning on having kids so I'm sure this will just get worse as we and our peers get older and more of them have kids.  

I know this is a common problem but it makes me sad.  I spend most weekends just with my partner and dog or by myself, zoning out to netflix or just doing the same stuff over and over again.  I just wish I had a couple local friends who were actually interested in hanging out, trying new things etc.  I love my partner but I don't think he should be my only source of socialization.

We saw some sights, ate at tourist-y places, and got on each other's nerves less. Most importantly, I said everything I needed to. I realize I'll always want more time with my parents, but at least I have not left things unsaid.

Here are things that helped: tying activities back to my parents' memories (my parents went to the same university so we watched that school's sports team play on TV,) helping Dad get more comfortable using mobility aids (I bought him a cane. He doesn't like using it, but he DOES like the special treatment and preferential seating he gets at venues. Ditto his handicapped parking placard. A more mobile Dad meant we could see a bit more on our trip,) and redirecting conversations when they veered onto morose topics.

I realize that my parents now are not who my parents were when I was a kid. It's inevitable but still painful: I want to still be able to go to them for advice or to have a sympathetic ear, but I'd just end up having to explain a lot and confusing them. 

I also realize that having strict boundaries around how often I see my parents and how long those visits last is a good thing. I think I'm done with traveling in order to see them. I think from now on I can instead travel to a place near them (like if there's a concert I go to that's near their house) and meet up for dinner or something. 

Finally, I realize that what my parents say and what they do are different things and that isn't my problem. If my mom swears up and down she wants to go visit Wyoming or Canada but constantly delays or cancels plans to actually do so, it's not my job to make a trip happen. 

TL;DR -- I implemented boundaries that made this trip successful, but which left me feeling emotionally disconnected from my parents. I consider this both sad and inevitable, and will limit the time I spend with them moving forward.",thefirststoryteller,1,11,1.0

Currently talking to someone from online dating for a little over a month and met twice, and while im dying to skip to the good part of finding out if we can become an item or not, i am fully aware that this is still really early on and i cant say i know this person but i do think i am someone who knows what she wants. 

Anyway, i would just like to know other adults thoughts on this. How slow is too slow? How long do you usually take to get to know someone? Etc.",asakura10,4,4,0.8
64,Mold/Mildew Smell üëÉü¶†,11858e6,"Tl;dr - I live in a rented duplex in Tennessee with a strong mildew/mold smell. There is also a large dipped section in the floor in the bathroom. The entire unit us covered in carpet and also smells musty. What should my next steps be?


I live in a rental duplex in Tennessee. We‚Äôve had rainy weather lately which has brought this more to my attention. When we moved in there was a large spot sank in the bathroom floor beside the tub. Before signing the lease we addressed this with the landlord and he said that he would fix it by the end of the year. Well this all happened in November so I thought he meant by the end of December. Turns out he meant by the end of our 12 month lease. What rights do I have? Is he responsible for an inspection? Any concerns we have mentioned to him he says well that‚Äôs what you get for this price point.

My daughter (she‚Äôs 9mo) and I are both showing symptoms of mold allergy exposure and I think it‚Äôs causing flare ups for my chronic illnesses. I worry about her crawling around on this carpet and getting a higher exposure.",Beneficial-Cicada809,1,2,1.0
65,Do I move out or continue living with my parents?,1183r0l,"I (23) work from home and have been living with my parents since graduating. I get on great with my parents, have saved up a good amount of money and have gotten very comfortable here. However, my social life is pretty much non existent (I leave the house a couple times a month to travel to see friends and I have a couple of holidays booked this year. But other than that I don't leave my room). Looking back I know I have wasted the past year sitting in my room alone on my phone since I have no friends or anything to do here as its a small village. 

I have recently been looking at house shares in a new city where i'd be living with strangers. The contracts im looking at are for 6 months, then rolling monthly after that and will cost about 650 a month bills included (about 40% of my take home pay). Moving out will be great for my social life and will build up my confidence again since moving back home I have reverted to my 16 year old self. It will also be easier for me to travel to places for weekend trips and seeing friends who live father away.

However, my parents think I should stay at home for another year to continue saving money (either to contribute towards a larger mortgage deposit or if i decide to go travelling one day), and this is making me have doubts too. More money in my savings will always be nice, but it would mean another year of being 'stuck' here doing nothing with my life.

Has anyone been stuck making a similar decision or have any advice on what I should do? I'm feeling very lost as this is my first big 'adult' decision and im TERRIFED of making the wrong one and having regrets.

70,Is it worth it to talk to my (22F) doctor about a problem I think I know the cause of?,1180jvd,"(Adding details not really for an armchair diagnoses, just for context): Basically I've been sleeping a LOT lately- I'm writing this at about 5:30 AM because I fell asleep at 6:30 PM last night and just now woke up. For the past week or so it's either been fall asleep in the very early evening, have a nap between 2-3 hours in the middle of the day, or push through with a super painful migraine that makes me irritable, low energy, and basically all the things you feel when you're sleep deprived.

HOWEVER, I'm fairly confident that the whole reason for this is because I have a really poor diet (hello broke college student) and so I don't know if there's any benefit to telling my doctor about it bc I feel like she'll prob just tell me to eat better and exercise more (which, fair). So how do you know what issues you should bring up with your doctor? Is it worth it to schedule a whole appointment when I'm 99% sure I know what she'll tell me?

Edit: Woah, didn't expect so many responses. I should've known the only thing Reddit loves to do more than analyze people's relationships from AITA posts is to give out armchair diagnoses üòÇ But straight up, thank you everyone who's responded. I agree with you all- it seems obvious in hindsight, but there's no way this amount of sleep is solely being brought on by my diet (mostly fast food and the cheap stuff they serve in the cafe). My diet hasn't changed that much in the past couple weeks, so there's no reason it should all of a sudden be affecting my sleep now (thanks to u/Deipnoseophist for pointing that out). Also thank you u/mynameisabbie for pointing out the obvious... if this were common for all broke college students then no one would ever make it to class! **So long story short, yes, I have a doctors appointment in the first week of March.**

Quick rundown reactions to some of y'all's comments: I do have insurance, I'm just still not used to making my own doctors appointments yet lol. I had blood tests done last summer and the only thing out of the ordinary was low Vitamin D, I've been taking supplementals or it ever since. I have an aunt who has hyperthyroidism, so it's definitely possible- I'll bring that up with my doctor specifically when I see her. I do also drink a lot of caffiene, and actually now that I think about it I think I'm drinking more this semester than I did last semester, so that could also be related. Definitely not pregnant (like DEFINITELY lmao). I live in a dorm on campus, so I would be very very shocked if it were carbon monoxide if only for the fact that tons of people here would be feeling like this... if it is, then catch me on r/legaladvice to see how much I can sue my school for lol.

74,Advice Needed - I (25F) moved out and my father (63M) was so furious that he broke the coffee table,117utjr,"TL;DR: Adult daughter (25F) moves out to live with boyfriend, father (63M) is furious and disrespectful to adult daughter and her boyfriend. How does the adult daughter handle him?

Hi Reddit, I would love to have your advice on this to find out whether I am being too unreasonable/harsh to my father.

I (25F) moved out 2 weeks ago to live with my boyfriend and his parents, as my boyfriend and I wanted to take the next step in our relationship (cohabitation). I informed my father of this 1 month in advance and promised him that I would visit once every 2 weeks. Although he took the news badly (he didn't talk to me for the entire month and when he did, he said that I was unfilial, cruel, and that I didn't love him anymore). Nonetheless, I figured that he would cool down in 2 weeks time when I came to visit him.

When I visited him 2 weeks later, it was an absolute disaster - he (a) shouted and screamed at me for not asking for permission first before moving out, (b) called my boyfriend names like ""motherfucker"" and ""bastard"" (my boyfriend wasn't there but this is still immensely disrespectful), (c) threw a coffee cup and broke the coffee table in his anger, and (d) requested for me to call him FIVE times a week. I eventually compromised and said I will call him once a week (on top of visiting once every two weeks).

I feel really, really anxious and uncomfortable at the thought of having any contact with him, but would like to know if (a) I am unreasonable for doing so and (b) if doing so would not be unreasonable, what would be the best way of reducing contact? My mom is still married to him and still lives with him, and it breaks my heart to feel like I am leaving her behind in his house to suffer with him and his temper.

86,Suing for malpractice/negligence?,117lq4w,"I posted in a legal advice subreddit, but I hope it's ok to post this here and get others' thoughts, too. Have any of you ever sued a healthcare  provider for negligence or malpractice? If so, what was your experience like and did you have a favorable outcome?

I injured my right pinky finger while making a jackolantern on Halloween and underwent tendon repair surgery 10 days later. The orthopedic surgeon's PA refused to refer me anywhere for physical therapy except for the place that is ""partnered with"" their practice and in the same building.

I asked to be referred elsewhere and, when refused, felt I had no other choice. I have been diligent about going and have seen little to no progress. It basically amounts to a therapy mill where there are at least three of us - and sometimes four - at a time with little one-on-one assistance from the therapist.

After seeking recommendations from friends, I found another physical therapist and was able to get someone else with the surgeon's office to refer me over and send over my paperwork week before last.

At my second post-op follow-up appointment last Monday, the PA was suddenly far more accommodating when I said I'd switched physical therapists and said she would write up a prescription for another 6 weeks of therapy with the new therapist and printed off the surgeon's notes for me to give the therapist. That step was unnecessary, as the new therapist had already obtained all of that paperwork by fax and email.

I was never given a copy of the surgeon's notes at any point after surgery and, in reading the copy I was given last week to bring to the new physical therapist, I discovered that he removed one tendon in my finger/hand during the repair surgery. I was never informed by him or any of his staff prior to surgery that removal of a tendon was a possibility, nor was I ever told afterward that it had been done or given a reason as to why. I am assuming and the new physical therapist suggested that it was done because the tendon was too damaged to repair.

Because a tendon is missing, that means I will never regain full, normal use of that finger again and cannot bend the first joint and very tip of it at all. The bending also seems to be limited to the one side of my finger, presumably due to the other side tendon being missing. It is, in my non-healthcare professional words, messed up.

I knew going into the surgery that the recovery would take time and a lot of PT and that that finger/hand wouldn't be as strong as it was before, but I had no idea of how limited things would be or that a tendon would be removed or had the possibility of being removed. I wouldn't have known that it was removed either had I not read the surgeon's notes from last week that I was told to give to the new physical therapist.

I am beyond upset and angry that the surgeon and his PA failed to inform me of this possible outcome and failed to inform me afterward that he had to excise a tendon. Are they not legally required to inform patients of every possible outcome and obtain their consent for something like this? And if it's a case of not knowing they'd have to remove the tendon until they got in the operating room, are they not legally required to inform the patient afterward of what was done and why?

They failed to inform me either way and I am angry. Do I have any recourse? How should I handle this going forward? Quite frankly, I feel I am owed a refund for all costs incurred up to this point, plus compensation, but that probably isn't going to happen.

At my job, there is a day crew and a night crew. We all work in an office part of a larger facility, but day crew does most of the ‚Äúon the phone‚Äù people work, while night crew handles billing related functions. All of night crew is
part time, while a few members of day crew are full time. 

Recently, one of the day crew members quit. Their position is being replaced by one of us from the night shift, and since it‚Äôs one of the few part time positions during the day, our management has decided it will be filled by seniority rather than an actual interview. 

It‚Äôs between me and someone below me in seniority. That person will only get the position if I say no (although given what I‚Äôm about to explain, no one particularly wants to take the position). 

The newly opened day time position is at 
/least/, most likely much more, more than double the work. The day crew as well is made up of very catty individuals who always find a way to be negative/complain about their coworkers. 

I expressed interest in the position when the announcement was first made maybe 2 weeks ago, and since then, have only talked to my supervisor twice about the details after seeking him out myself. Everything Ive heard about the position has been gossip amongst the night crew, and I have found out lots about managements plans for me FROM THEM.

‚ÄúWill I get to talk to you before *date mentioned by supervisor that I‚Äôm ‚Äòsupposed to take the position‚Äô*?‚Äù

His response as, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôd like,‚Äù with a smile on his face. 

Are you kidding me?! There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm taking double the work, with a more hostile work environment, for the same pay. The position I have now is very cushy and I am very lucky. I even work at a similar time to my father, who occasionally will bring in food for me, so I seriously have absolutely ZERO incentive to take this other position. 

The only way I‚Äôd be willing to is if it‚Äôs a pay increase, or if they‚Äôd be willing to work with me and my mental health needs. I have CPTSD, anxiety, depression, etc from a very unsafe environment as a child, and bickering/arguing/hostile environments are a HUGE trigger for me. My bosses don‚Äôt know the specifics, but I‚Äôve already had issues with another extremely childish night crew member, so they are and have been aware of my sensitivities. There have been nights when things are so tense I have to make multiple trips to the bathroom in attempts to not throw up due to my nervousness/heart palpitations.

I have a feeling there is no pay increase which is why they are avoiding it. The only other way I‚Äôd consider it is if they give me more flexibility with my mental health needs, except I don‚Äôt really know what to ask for. Does anyone have any advice?

EDIT: I‚Äôd like to add, the woman who just left had chronic migraines and rarely came into work, so I do know there are accommodation options available. 

TL;DR: I think my employer is trying to get me to just ‚Äúgive in‚Äù to a new position with more work and less flexibility. They will not answer my question about if there is a pay increase, so I want to ask for mental health accommodations instead. What should I ask for?",jtaliax,2,4,0.87

I am a terrible adult.   I am almost 30 and I am a sex worker(plus size cam girl and pso).  I went to college for a year and a half and that was interesting.   I have only had one ""real"" job and that lasted for 30 days(long story).   I can't find anyone to be with because I am funny looking.

My only friends are a 67 year old toddler who takes my kindness for blindness and a 59 year old ex-crackhead who may or may not want to fuck me(I am not a lesbian tho).

I am not close to any of my family and the one person who I have a semi relationship with is my cousin and I want to knock the shit out of him 98.6 percent of the time.

My mother died 8 years ago from thyroid cancer and her birthday is on the 9th and so I expect to be sad about that soon.   I am still not past that loss and I never will be.

My shrink decided to leave his practice in December of 2021 and so I haven't seen a shrink since then and I was going to him for 2 years.

I am severely depressed and I am sad that my life has taken a turn that I never intended on.

I am broke 98 percent of the time(including this moment) and no matter how many reddit groups that I ask for help in,  I never get it.

I have an apartment and I try to keep it clean but sometimes I just don't give a fuck and that's a terrible way to be.   I don't even clean out my fridge as much as I should and I am surprised that it doesn't look like a swamp in there.

I just always thought that my life would be different at this age.   I thought that I would be successful and happy and in love and maybe with a couple of rugrats running around.   

I am lost and I have NO idea what the fuck I am doing in life.   I have no real direction.   I am scared 3/4's of the time that I am going to do something so dumb that it boggles the imagination and completely fucks up my life.

I literally wish sometimes that god had taken me instead of my mother because I am such a fucked up adult and no matter what I do, its not the right thing to do.

What gives me comfort though is looking out of my massive window to the trees outside. When I sit at my desk, I can't see people or cars on the road, so unless there is an ambulance or something.

When I move out, I'll have 2 small windows instead of 1 big window. I'll also see houses across the street. That will definitely be an adjustment and that made me think about the many things that will change.

I'll have a neighbor that is like 80 years old and never makes a sound. If I don't turn on the radio or something it will be super quiet.  No more slamming doors, no more yelling, nothing. I think I'll finally have the space and the right atmosphere to do yoga or meditation without being mocked. My parents don't mind if I do it, but in the back of my mind, I feel like they think it's stupid.

On one hand, I'm really worried that everyone will forget me and that I'll be miserable and lonely, on the other hand, I just want to let go of all the tension and see what kind of person I actually want to be when I'm on my own. Most important of all, I want to do things that make me happy and be the person that makes me happy. I don't want to worry about people seeing me dress femme, I want to conquer my fears and anxiety, I want to be able to say fuck it and go out for dinner or take my work laptop and work at a random coffee place.

This is usually a step that adults who still live at home have to take eventually, but the problem isn't the actual process of paying the rent - I would pay my parents rent money all day long if I didn't have to worry about money - it's just how I'll be able to do it. 

My parents are financially comfortable enough that they wouldn't experience a strain by letting me live at home (from what I've been told), but the prospect of paying rent is just new....it's growth, after all...and a little scary. 

All things considered, I know that my parents wouldn't set these requirements if they didn't think I was actually capable of them. That's kind of been the thing I've been using to motivate myself -- not 'oh my god, I'm gonna get kicked out and be homeless if I can't make this money every week/month' since they explained that this was mostly a testing ground.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä 

Edit:  It'll probably be $100 a week (corrected for clarification) but I'm a little worried that the job I'm working now won't be enough for me to pay for some of my other needs (school, personal, a possible surgery in the next few months, etc.) I might need an invasive orthognathic surgery for my sleep apnea and TMJ and that my other monthly expenses are just gonna, like, swallow that up. 
  ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä 

 I'm lucky to be making $120-$160 a week right now, and as long as I'm needed there, I know it won't be an impossible hill to manage. It won't leave much else, but it's achievable. It's a job that I chose because it gives me the flexibility to do my coursework. I do know that whether or not I 'needed' to pay rent at home, that my parents aren't wrong for asking, and that, if anything, it's a good way to start practicing independence.

There are other hurdles that are harder for me to jump, though. I had the worst experience in driver's ed, and I'm scared af to drive. I know that *not* driving limits my options as to what I can actually do, since most things aren't within walking distance where I live, but I'm just not sure I'm *ready* for it. I probably *would* drive everywhere instead of walking or biking if it wasn't so nervewracking for me.

I guess all that I'm really asking for is some encouragement/some advice to help me start adjusting to these new transitions and expectations. I'm already looking for more work close by, considering quitting my current childcare job in my neighborhood unless I can bargain with the parents I babysit for for a raise, and seeing what I can do from home in the meantime before I look for places that require driving.

98,Very Lost,116xdjw,"I (26M) need some advice on my situation which is quite specific to my industry. This‚Äôll probably be quite long and niche so apologies in advance.

I moved to Los Angeles 5 years ago or so with a goal to direct commercials. In the meantime, I did a ton of freelance office assistant work on commercial sets, etc. I was working at least 12 hours a day, usually closer to 14, hated the work, and was making okay money ($3-$5k/mo). It sucked in many but my drive to reach my dream kept me going.

Towards the end of that time, I had periods where I got some really great gigs and eventually saved up enough to stop doing assistant work and transitioned into editing and some other freelance work to fill my time but wasn‚Äôt really working full time. 

Then, last year, I finally reached my goal of directing commercials. I had a 6 month run where I made really good money, loved what I was doing, etc. I had to drop a bunch of my freelance gigs to take on the insane workload. 

All of a sudden, my directing work dried up and hasn‚Äôt picked back up. I‚Äôve spent the last few months scrambling to get any freelance gigs back but most of my previous clients hired on full time staff to fill what I was doing. I‚Äôm making really shitty money right now and having to budget to insane levels so I don‚Äôt run out of money. I can‚Äôt take something traditionally full time because if I get a directing job, I basically have to drop everything I‚Äôm doing and go all in. Because I‚Äôve spent so much time on my directing career, my other skills are definitely lacking so it makes finding work really tough.

I‚Äôm hesitant to go back to college, because the first time around didn‚Äôt go well at all for numerous reasons, and I also can‚Äôt afford it right now. One of the issues I had in college was that for a good majority of the 4 semesters i was there, I was being taught things I already knew and I got bored very quickly, all while not really knowing what I wanted to do. Right now the two biggest things I want to do is to start a clothing brand and to have a music career. You could say my overarching goal is to be creative and make money while doing so. What I do know is that if I want any of my ideas to be successful, I need to understand business and learn how to run my own business.

114,Social Skills Advice for Young Adult,116l17r,"
I am currently enrolled in a cohort-based web 3 course and I unknowingly asked an indecent question without meaning to.

And now, I don't to be there anymore. The host was supportive and didn't take the other meaning of the question. But, I saw he was irritated max but kept his composure.

I am super new to web 3 but still, I end up making gullible mistakes all the time.

I don't face difficulty in learning concepts and skills. But, with anything social, I flounder every time.

I am recovering from a chronic condition and there is still some brain fog. I was bedridden for 14 months after COVID and couldn't talk for 19 months owing to Chronic Granular Pharyngitis. After this, I struggled a lot even adding up words while talking/ texting or even walking or brushing my teeth. Everything was a challenge. And it is still somewhat difficult. I don't do my assignments with the same astuteness as earlier. I am better with my health now.

Being said this, I wasn't good with social skills ever.  Butt now I feel my brain works at a slower pace.  Also, I feel that now I  speak whatever I am thinking, which isn't the best thing to happen. Cause I don't think as clearly as I used to. And there isn't a filter on my mind now. I wasn't this crude with my words.


For context:In the web3 presentation, the host asked us to guess about the niche of a project which rug pulled. Most of us guessed Art based on NFT but the host said it's not. Then, I guessed Actors/Influencers which the host said is correct.
And revealed the actor's name.

I googled the actor's name and didn't find the actor's wiki. So, I asked about the same on the live Zoom call chat. It was some adult film actor and that's why no wiki.

In haste, I ended up making this blunder
And this isn't even my first one

For some reason, I end up making these mistakes.


For more context, I am grown up in a protective loving family. Most of my friends are over a decade old. I have always known most of the people I know.

116,What do you do with your pets when you need to travel but don't have any friends to watch them?,116cj62,"I'm going to be moving in a few months and want to travel but I have two cats. I've never boarded them because of the costs. Despite their low needs, the few friends I have in my current town are usually too busy to catsit so I only can take 1 vacation a year (3 days max). I only need them to be fed once a day. No medication and they are nice to whoever feeds them. 

I know some people travel with their cats but mine prefer to stay in the house and putting them on a plane is a huge ordeal. Once I move I won't know anyone who can come feed them while I take a trip. 

How do people with pets travel? Do you really pay strangers online to enter your home while you're gone? Do you pay hundreds of dollars to board them?",Sara_is_here,310,177,0.92

120,How do you deal with parents with a victim mentality?,1163hmj,"For example, when I try to express to them something I‚Äôm struggling with, they take it personally and make it about them. Like I‚Äôll be going through something that‚Äôs very stressful for me and I‚Äôll try to express that to them in the way I know how, and they will then get mad at me for not handling it myself like an independent adult. Like they‚Äôll be upset I‚Äôm even opening up to them. Sometimes it takes me back to trying to figure out if I‚Äôve done something to upset them from before, because they seem like there‚Äôs some unresolved anger they have towards me. I used to be oblivious to this possibility, and just behaved in response to how I thought they wanted me to behave, which essentially was someone that was extremely unlikeable. Or perhaps they genuinely think I‚Äôm just not a good person. It can get very heated.

Or like my mom thinks for example, she never gets to speak and is never heard. As a result she will interrupt me incessantly or talk over me a lot. I‚Äôll get upset because of this and she‚Äôll then take it as me not wanting to hear her. I can‚Äôt nurse her to understand this as her daughter because that‚Äôs not fair to me. I hate having to explain this to her because she‚Äôll take that as me being a coach or guide for her, and she will act all satisfied about that afterwards.

I‚Äôm trying to place my finger on it and that it might be a victim mentality. How do you deal with someone like that? And if it‚Äôs your parent and you‚Äôre still trying to be an adult yourself and break out from them in a healthy way. Like I‚Äôm still living at home with them.

It also wasn‚Äôt an EOB, but rather a direct bill from the practice asking me to pay, with options for a payment plan, etc. I will be calling them to dispute this but what can I say to really hammer home the point? Is there a body that regulates this sort of practice in healthcare? Sort of like a FTC? TIA! 

For context,
1. I was told that my copay is 0 on the phone and this was written in an email that the rep sent to me later after as well
2. The doctor I saw is listed as in-network on my insurance provider‚Äôs website 
3. My insurance provider says that specialists, like a psychiatrist, will come with a copay of $40 (I‚Äôve previously seen specialists that have charged me like $20, so I wasn‚Äôt surprised by the rep saying that my copay is $0).

126,[Long] Is it worth dipping into my savings in order to move out of my parent's house?,115wbrr,"I'm 31, so I know everyone is going to shit on me for being such a loser.  

I have about $100,000 saved up between high yield savings accounts, three Roth IRAs, and treasury bonds.  About $40,000 is liquid but the rest could be accessible if needed, is what I'm saying. 


My current income is about $1200/month doing a remote job that doesn't pay well at all.  The thing is though is living on my own would enable me to have the confidence and freedom to come and go for interviews and work, whereas living with my parents doesn't.  It's not necessarily helicopter parenting as it is an interrogation basically, so I just don't go anywhere.  I've left the house less than ten times since September.    I quit my previous job in September because the stress from that place and the stress from my parents got too much to handle.  I know that makes me a loser and I regret it every single day. The only good thing that came out of it was that it enabled me to get Medicaid and have health insurance for the first time in my adult life, and it has given me time to get a couple certificates in coding, which I'm terrible at, and HVAC, which I'm 80% of the way through studying.  Quitting that job didn't help mentally though because I feel like the biggest fucking failure for quitting and only making half of what I made there. 


Ultimately, I get it that it's up to me to stop being a piece of shit. I get it.  It's just hard when the only people I have any contact with are the people who basically don't want anything else in life for me. I missed out on an interview for a job I would have needed a degree for anywhere else just because my mom talked me out of going for it.  That job pays 4x what I make now and if I get my own place, I'll reapply. It's third shift, which wouldn't work living at my parents because they sleep about 15 hours of the day and me coming and going while they're asleep would cause problems.  


Basically, my life has been on hold all of this time, except for about 5 months when I was 21 and had moved out, because of living with them for the sake of saving up money.  They told me to live with them and save for a house instead of renting.  But when it came time to look at houses, they were no help at all and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing in looking for a house and have nobody to ask.  So all of that saving seems like it was for nothing since I doubt I'd even qualify for a mortgage at my income.  


So here's the monthly budget if I moved out:

Rent: $790 (monthly cat fee and renter's insurance included)

Car insurance: $90

Electric is the only bill I'd have to pay: $100 (total guess so let me know if I'm way off)
It's electric heat but I can just not heat the place because my cat has heating pads and I can live with the cold if I need to

Internet: $50 (another guess)

Groceries: $50

Cat's medicine/food: $50

Hulu: $1.99

Gas: $30 (I don't drive much and any job I get will be nearby. Usually I fill up about 6 times a year)

So, until I found another job, I'd have to dip into savings for maybe a couple hundred each month.

Every 4 months, my cat's vet appointments are $375 but that's something I have no problem pulling out of savings for.  Her medicines are about $300 altogether but I always get gift cards through rewards sites or sales to get them discounted so this isn't an issue.

Groceries are low because I eat 4-5 meals a week and fast the rest of the time. Living alone would allow me to fast more and have space to stock up on items when they're on sale, which I can't do now due to space. 
When I had my own place when I was 21, I didn't eat from stress and got down to about 90 pounds and would like to be in that range again.  That would be another benefit of having my own place.


My issue is that, while I feel like having my own place would feel like I've finally started my life at nearly 32 years old, I'm sacrificing financial security.  But at the same time, how long do I keep sacrificing having any kind of happiness for the sake of maybe owning a house one day?  With the rate I'm at, I won't ever own a house; I'll just keep telling myself to save for one more year and then start looking again but it'll never actually happen because I'll convince myself not to leave. There is a house that I like that's $125,000 and that's about my price range. It's just ugly as hell.",aunttjemima,48,26,0.76

\-. The iphone 14 doesn't have a sim card.  
\-How do I find the serial number and the IMEI?

\-Apple doesn't produce the same phone I had last time anymore, so I had to upgrade and pay monthly for this phone.  


\-I pay for insurance through AT&T. It's $9. Is that through apple care or the line individually?

\-Can I find out through apple or do I need to have a Mac Book or any apple product?

\-How do I find this information without having to use someone else's phone.   
\- I can't even log into my accounts without having my phone.  
\-I'm in a new area so I use a GPS for everything.   
( I just printed out directions to go to an event for my new job)   


\-What is the easiest way to save money. (without pressing charges) And Just live my life with the privilege of having a phone? Having a phone is apart of my job's uniform.

&#x200B;

\-Thank you. I'm trying my best to remain patient.

Basically my job offered me a truck stipend so I can upgrade my truck from a small one to a larger one because it's safer for my work. My credit score is pretty good ranging between 672 and 706 depending on which credit score you're looking at, but my credit history is very short. I've only had a credit card for a little while.

The dealerships are offering me about a grand for trade-in.

My concern is that I'll sell my truck and then not get approved for financing and I don't really have anyone that can co-sign with me. Then I won't have a truck to do my job and I won't have enough money to purchase a new one.

152,Has anyone else owed a ton of money in taxes while being low income?,114ryjw,"I did my taxes and owed over $800. Thankfully I was able to pay it using some of my savings, but I‚Äôm upset that I owed that much. I‚Äôve never heard of a low income person not getting a tax return, let alone owing that much. 

I‚Äôll admit I made a mistake. I work remotely, and I moved states and forgot to let employer know for months. I didn‚Äôt know it would effect my taxes because because I thought you paid taxes based on where your employer was located. 

I ended up telling them, but didn‚Äôt tell them when I moved. I now know that means taxes were being paid to the wrong state. 

Here‚Äôs what confuses me though - I ended up owing the hundreds of dollars in taxes to the old state I used to live. That doesn‚Äôt make sense to me because for months my tax withholdings were going to them, not the new state. Interestingly enough, I ended up getting a meager tax return from the new state. 

I wonder if HR withheld the wrong amount of taxes from my old state. I haven‚Äôt said anything because I don‚Äôt want to have to admit my mistake and end up getting fired. 

I‚Äôve decided to just let this be an expensive lesson - but it still bothers me.

My girlfriend and I are soon to be moving cross country. We are both recent college graduates with a sum total of about 13k saved up and an average credit score of 730. However, neither of us will have jobs upon arrival. We will be staying with my close friend for a month while we try to get established (ie looking for a job and landing an apartment.). However, if we do not get established within a month, we may have to seek a long-term motel rental (I don't feel like overstaying my welcome at my friend's). Both of us have good resumes and I have no doubt we will be able to land jobs; but I assume the process to get a job, demonstrate income, and land an apartment will take more than a month.

   However, my father is willing to co-sign (not pay for) an apartment for us, he makes about 150k and would be able to satisfy the 5x rent requirement of the apartments we would be looking for (<1.4k).

This is a family member with a history of drug use, and this makes us pretty positive she‚Äôs back on drugs. She also doesn‚Äôt pay any living expenses because she mooches off of her mother (who she also has stolen from). Let me be very clear: We DO NOT plan on giving her any money whatsoever. 

My question is how to handle our response to her. To be honest, it makes me angry that she asked. It feels like she‚Äôs trying to take advantage of us, specifically my husband because he‚Äôs super sweet and caring. It just so happens that she messaged us the day she found out we were moving into a much bigger house too, so that makes me feel even more like she‚Äôs trying to take advantage of our new financial situation. We‚Äôve worked our butts off to get to this place in our life, and all she has done is try to mooch off of anyone she can. My gut reaction is to tell her off in response to her question, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the right route, especially if addiction is her issue. 

How should we respond to this request? Short and sweet? Empathetic to her drug situation? Maybe a little snippy so she doesn‚Äôt do this again?

ETA: UPDATE

Thank you all for such thoughtful responses! My husband decided he‚Äôs going to go the ‚Äúghost her‚Äù route, although I‚Äôd prefer the short and to the point ‚Äúno‚Äù response. If she begs again, we‚Äôll use my way. I‚Äôm curious if she will continue to ask. Also curious to see if she still will plan on coming to my son‚Äôs birthday‚Ä¶

He‚Äôs going to reach out to his mom to see if she can agree not to give her money and discuss what steps to take if his aunt is back to using. 

To those who are worried about security, I appreciate the concern and I understand it‚Äôs a very valid concern with drug related situations like this. Luckily, we live pretty far from her and she has a real crappy car, so that lessens the risk. I realize it doesn‚Äôt eliminate it though. We‚Äôll be extra careful, and yes, we do have a security system!

Mostly, I realized I have to have compassion for this person, even though this does frustrate me. But y‚Äôall, it‚Äôs so tough. I have dealt with a couple addicts in my life, and it‚Äôs so hard to see where the personality ends and the addiction begins, ya know?

As said in the title, I landed my first job and needed some extra directions as to what to do next.

For context: I'm 22 and live in a third-world country where jobs are scarce. After High-School, I followed an online course in a field that's reasonably needed here and gained quite some skills. After some time, I started an internship at a company and they decided to keep me with a nice salary increase.

On a personal level, I live with my parents and I pay some of the bills, yet it still leaves me with a nice margin at the end of the month. Having that extra cushion is nice but I'm not sure if the way I'm planning on leveraging it is correct.

My main goal is to be at the top of my field. I don't want to focus on the money right now and regret it later when I stagnate in my career. Improving is key, and I have to do everything to make it happen

My plan is to keep doing what I did to get there. Study some advanced materials, broaden my understanding, and just get better. I want to do a better job, and also become a better coworker, so I'll need to eventually train those soft skills.

Most of my friends are from my hobby so not much in the way of deep friendships separate though I have made some good ones. But yes, my whole personal identity is tied up in this too. 

Flunked / tested out of school and crashed and burned in community college so still no job skills and people skills are worse than ever. I hung on the same company for 22 years at barely above minimum wage because it was poorly managed and they didn't fire people and tolerated a lot and thus was very compatible with my lifestyle. I really lucked out with cheap housing here in metro LA, even now.

I have never had a drivers license. When I say adolescent mind I mean it. 

At some point I got into a pricing arbitrage scheme related to my hobby and I was suddenly pulling six figures for a few years in a row before it unraveled last year. Most of these pricing gaps and opportunities have been closed off. Still living the minimum wage lifestyle with a pathetically impoverished roommate but the money won't last forever. 

No game plan for eventually getting a job and acting like a responsible adult.

No game plan for what to do when I finally need to look for housing again. I might be able to afford to buy a house - somewhere, but I need things in walking distance so maybe not. 

No game plan for when the inevitable health problems creep in. I do not have health insurance and I haven't been to the doctor since 1992. Thankfully no major accidents or health problems, that I am aware of. This is partially because I didn't want to spend money best directed to my hobby (life), and later on became a strategic form of slow motion suicide that would also help close the gap as I figured once I hit that brick wall of reality, I would rather put the lights out then live any other way. This was kind of my insurance that perhaps natural causes could take care of it. 

This is the big one, what do I do when I get sick? No one to help me when I get way too old. I tried to be nicer to my somewhat orphaned nieces in another state but I think it ended up just being awkward and I don't even try anymore. I think they hate me.    


I do exercise and eat healthy so I don't need advice on how to keep illness at bay. Unless I get hit by a car or stabbed at a bus stop I absolutely will get seriously ill some some day.  Current issues that would interfere with future employment is a lower back issue for 16 years that prohibit standing for long periods of time as well as a blown out right ear which makes interpersonal communication and phone work increasingly difficult. And of course whatever mental issues I have been feeding and avoiding for decades.

I've got a former friend, who at one time, was my best friend and also trainer, and we did everything together

He would really always push me to be better in a lot of a ways, would always encourage me to grow, get out of my comfort zone, and to just work towards my best - I made a lot of significant life changes with his help and my own dedication, and really improved my health and habits

We did end up falling out - There weren't hard feelings so to speak, more a disagreement led to us no longer working together and we kind of agreed to go our separate ways and to do our own thing

Long story long, he texted me, I didn't respond for two years. I texted him, he responded and we had a pretty halfhearted conversation. But, he's reached out again. I just couldn't really say how I feel about reconnecting.

So why am I having a mental break down?

Shamefully it all because am just really fking scare that I can't even be a reliable adult soon. I feel like I still a fking baby need to rely on my parent just to survive.

Just graduate a with a CS degree in this horrible job market.

So I moved back to my mother house in Vietnam.

Primarily cause I have no more money to live in USA anymore and by the time I got on the plane I have only like 12$ left on me.

Now I just at home..... trying to study but couldn't cause I feel so...dumb and unmotivated

I applied to so many company here, only 3 got back to me here and even with help from relatives, nothing.

I got 1 interview from a small startup here and got an internship position that last 6 months.

But the internship will only pay me $150 per month. And idk if this will even help me advance my career. 

When I told my mother (who been paying my school tuition all these years) about the position. She tried to sound neutral but I can tell she was fairly disappointed in me. Imagine invest thousand of dollar for your son to just get a ""job"" that pay $150 a month. That's pretty much minimum wage for Vietnam.

It must be so hard for her to not compare me to my older sister. Who's super smart and making ridiculous amount of money the moment she graduated. Her career keep getting better through out the years and heck she have enough to retired in 3-5 years. She like the opposite of me, smart, successful, she amazing at communicating, even with her broken English everyone adore her.  My family try to remind me to not compare myself to her, but how can I not.

One other big thing that been gnawing a me is that I have 0 motivation in achieving anything in life. I don't have any dreams, ambition or any form of goals. I feel so lost and useless. I have very little friends also. Currently only 2 that I speak a bit to but no one I feel like I can share much to. I'm just really bad at making friends and talking to people am not close with.

I know that I'm one of the lucky Vietnamese that got the chance to move to US early on, study there, graduate there. Heck even in Vietnam I don't have to worry about rent. But that just make me feel even more worthless, even with all of these opportunity given to me, I felt like I wasted all of them. And every night the thought that I have disappoint everyone in my family just grow and grow and it really shutting me down.

tl;dr:  I feel like an privilege brat that wasted all the opportunity given to me, have massive inferior complex and can't handle the stress feeling very pathetic.

195,Dreading Visiting My Parents,112kb2v,"I (34m) am seeing my parents (early to mid 70s) this weekend. I'm pretty much dreading it. 

This isn't new. I've dreaded visiting my folks more and more as time goes on. The vibrant, happy, energetic couple I knew from my childhood have turned into unhappy, nervous, boring people. I do want my parents in my life. But I also don't want 3 hours of conversation focused around death, crime, or other unhappy topics. (They watch a lot of news, and US news sometimes tends to emphasize lurid or negative headlines. If it bleeds it leads.)

Yes I still love my parents. Yes I still call them, visit them, text often. Yes I know a lot of this is aging. Yes I've suggested therapy for them and that got my invite to last Christmas revoked, so.....yeah. 

One parent sleeps, eats, and watches TV. That's the three things they do most every day and it's tough to get them to travel or do anything outside of that routine. The other parent constantly makes plans, backs out at the last second, talks about how lonely they are, but never makes plans to see somewhere new, visit relatives, or try anything outside of their routine. 

After one or two days seeing my parents I can feel myself get more negative and close-minded. My parents used to get tons of physical exercise, they traveled numerous times a year, they were active in their community well past their respective retirements. And then.....something happened. It's like a switch was flipped and my parents became the exact opposite of the people I knew. 

I spoke to my sister and my aunts and uncles. Everyone agrees that my parents just...declined? Gave up? I don't want to be rude but that's truly what it seems like. I spent about 2 years trying to talk to my parents about it, I even planned 2-3 family trips, paid for them all, and then my parents canceled due to vague worries about crime (once), not wanting to be away from home if someone calls even though both of my parents have cell phones (once), and not wanting to leave their routine. 

This weekend happened because my sister and I basically forced my parents into it, but I'm already seeing myself trying to find ways to minimize time with my parents. 

Just typing this out makes me think that it's time for me to call it quits. Yes I'll still text and call, but I may have to be done trying to visit them often and planning trips with them. If they really wanted to travel--they would. If they won't, then I'll share travel photos with them once I get back.",thefirststoryteller,51,109,0.95
196,Always make sure your appreciated,112k6u0,"I think this is something a lot of people feel trapped about in their professional lives, but you should always make sure your appreciated. With my current employer it started off pretty good (I manage IT for the company and companies that they own) but a month and a half ago things got pretty crazy. The company bought three new businesses and added another site for one of the other ones. Suddenly I have to build three IT infrastructures from scratch and Integrate another into ours. Two of the three new businesses were due to open in a month so I was scrambling; chasing down hardware to meet the specs they wanted, setting up ISPs and services, deal with conflicting information from the new owners, it was a mess. On top of this I had my regular duties and tickets all the while the people I usually assisted were getting pissed that I wasn't being as attentive and the new owners were unhappy with the difficulties I was having getting their sites set up. In the end I was able to set everything up and catch up with my tickets but the big bosses were still not happy. They pulled me into a meeting while I was still busy and chewed my ass out. I was so annoyed at their ridiculousness that I quit on the spot. It felt good but also a bit scary. I've never quit without giving notice and when I didn't have another job lined up.

I was hoping someone with more experience/mature would be able to show how they'd approach this situation, as this is my first time organizing a group trip.

I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but basically I am trying to organize a 4-day weekend trip. My one friend, booked tickets without even checking hotel prices. This friend, is also jobless and their budget is a huge rate-limiting factor to the entire group.

Not to mention, I extended our time there with my SO and I to have alone time after everyone left. But my friend did the same, and keeps on broadcasting to the group ""oh yeah we (us 4) booked our tickets for the whole week because why not?!""

I know it is my fault for not stopping my friend early, but now two others have booked their tickets past the 4-day weekend mark because (I'm assuming) they're expecting to room and split costs with us and basically stick with us for almost the entire week.

I never wanted this, but I also know there is responsibility on my shoulders as I was the one who organized this trip. I did not want everyone to stay beyond 4-days, and now I feel obliged to room with them and basically keep them company for the entire week.

Obviously I know nothing will be solved unless I make it clear to the group my expectations and the stress I am feeling because of this, and I also need to... talk to my friend about how poorly they handled their end of the trip which is affecting my planning. But idk if you guys have any pointers on how to handle this civilly without throwing anyone or myself under the bus because even if I talk to my friend privately, I know they won't bring it up to the group and it'll be me cleaning up their mess.

* I don't have credit history in the United states at all. I just have been here for 3 months (maybe that's why too the price is high).
* Monthly payment is under the 10% of my salary, maybe a 9% of my take home salary (my monthly take home is $4,000)

200,Trying to make friends after being on the move for years...advice?,112d5jj,"Hi, 30M here, for the last few years, I've been trying to figure out who I was and what my values indeed were. Before the pandemic, I was happy because I thought I had everything in my life stable - friends, work, activities, etc. That said, due to it, things changed drastically, and I had to start over completely. It's the longest I've ever stayed in one area, and now I'm questioning if that was the right choice.

While I have gone to therapy, the main thing I feel that I've gotten from it is my constant need to reset my life in the pursuit of greener pastures. This makes me feel whole, but ultimately ruins many of my relationships. In nearly every situation in which I have had a particularly large negative experience, my response has always been to move away and start anew. This has taken me very far away from home, and while I have many acquaintances, I have no one to share any long-term memories with for the most part. On paper, this has been really great for my life, but not so much for my emotional health. Since the pandemic, I haven't been able to move, and now I'm starting to hit a wall. I'm not sure how to make long-term friends and I worry quite a bit about bothering the few friends that I already have (*near and far away*). Plus, in speaking with my old friends, I wonder if it was ever right to move away.

Lately, I've been trying to go back to school with the goal of making friends, but my S/O is understandably adamantly against that. This is mostly because the programs I am picking are in areas that they have never seen me express interest in ever, but in reality, they are areas I've been too embarrassed to explore before. Either way, I've always been the ""adoptive friend"" and I've always struggled to make friends on my own, let alone maintain them. I was hoping that entering a cohort of sorts may help with that, as my intention is to make friends this time.

As far as other things go, I have tried to make friends through other means, such as sports, gaming, food, work, etc. but in every single instance, I find that I feel extremely out of place amongst them. I'd assume this is normal, but I find that in doing this, I am becoming shyer and shyer around others, which is something I never thought myself to be. I feel like I'm giving up on being sociable because while I know what I want, I'm not 100% sure how to get there, or if the ways I am trying are the right way to go about it. It's been about 5 years now, and I'm trying to find an answer other than moving away and starting over, but if that is the only way, I guess I'm able to do it.",siege5548,1,4,0.84

Recently it's gotten worse though, as I've had to set a boundary with a coworker who lives close by that I carpool with as they often bring up racially charged topics, and I find their opinions of them troubling (not going into all of that in this post but basically they are racist). In response they have decided they won't be driving me anymore. I respect that decision but it still makes things challenging.

I have always disliked the environment at my work, it feels very clique-y and exclusionary which made me feel unwelcome in the office. This has been made worse by my aforementioned coworker not really talking to me anymore.

I do not have a car and often take the bus, which is an hour and a half both there and back, which takes up too much of my time. When I first was hired I was told that working from home on some days would be an option, but that seems to be frowned upon, and it is also difficult to work from home because of work server connectivity issues.

I also feel like there is zero opportunity for growth or advancement for me in this company. My skills have stagnated because of how dull and rudimentary my tasks are, and I do not have the energy or motivation to pursue personal projects after working 8 hours and commuting 2-3 most days. I worry that I will not be able to get a new job in the industry because it is constantly evolving and I am stuck in this dead end job.

I want to bring up issues like this to my manager, however they have shown a lot of instances of having poor emotional maturity, and has publicly reprimanded me for a misunderstanding of unclear expectations in the workplace. Because of this I frankly have trust issues here; I worry that my concerns will only open me up to resentful comments.

The straw for me lately was that I have been moved from having my own office with a door, to having a makeshift office in the corner of the lobby. This was to accomodate a new employee. This would not be so bad, except it is the second time I have had to move offices to accomodate someone new in the span of 6 months, and now I have been downgraded to essentially a cubicle. It shouldn't be a big deal, but it is always me who needs to move to accomodate new workers. This makes me feel undervalued at work.

All in all, I do not like the work environment, the commute is challenging, and the work itself is both unfulfilling and has roadblocks to getting it done efficiently. The only thing truly tethering me to this job is money, and even then I do not make enough to be able to support myself should I move into my own place. Rent has risen drastically in Nova Scotia where I live, and inflation has made groceries and other necessities more and more expensive.

I do not need to be completely fulfilled at my job, it can be a means to an end. But it is making me feel terrible and I actively dread going every day. 

I have nothing lined up which makes me nervous about leaving, but I need time to find another job and work makes it difficult to do so. I am fortunate enough to live with my parents, and pay them a bit of rent each month to help them out with expenses, which I am more than happy to do. 

If I do leave, I will not be on the streets, which I am aware is a priveleged position to be in. All that is to say I have a fair bit of money saved up should I be out of an income, but I do want to return to the workforce as soon as possible should I leave my current job. Even a retail job part time would suffice for a bit until I can find something more consistent.

Regardless I still am torn on if/when to leave without something lined up. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",strangestbeard,4,8,0.86

I‚Äôm planning to move to a bigger city three hours away where two of my oldest friends live. They‚Äôre super fun, really social, like minded people. But as I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôve noticed some toxic behavior in them and idk if it‚Äôs bad enough to make me not want to move. So here are pros and cons.

Pros:
Get to move out of parents 

Already have a friend group, don‚Äôt need to try to make friends.

The friends will introduce me to new people (I‚Äôm thinking specifically about meeting a partner, or just new good friends)

We have similar interests.

Won‚Äôt be lonely always something going on.

get to live in a big city be exposed to more,lots of things to do.

Better job opportunities.

CONS:

Friends are a little shallow.

They tend to be catty and mean.

I feel like I have to keep up with them and maintain a cool and confident vine at all times.

Lots of drinking and eating out. (Also a pro a little bit but they party a lot) 

Sometimes they call me, and I feel ashamed.

I feel like I am always on guard.

Stupid, I know, but it was always something that could wait until tomorrow, y'know?

Saturday I got caught speeding quite badly on the highway during a rare long trek. 78 in a 55. I don't have any excuse really I just was driving and not thinking about my speed and fell right into a little speed trap. Dumb dumb mistake.

So now I've gotten a ticket for speeding as well as having expired registration plate and expired vehicle inspection and my address changed when I moved here two years ago and I never notified them.

The advice I've gotten from multiple representatives of the state is to order a duplicate license, go to the license plate agency and get a temporary tag, then go to a mechanic for the inspection, then go back to the plate agency for a new plate. Once I've gotten all of those ducks in a row I have to appear in court and let them know I took care of my registration to drop the charges and then I just have to deal with the speeding ticket. Is this solid advice? Is there a more efficient way to take care of these things?

i just got back from hanging out with a friend, and I've been covering both of our food every time we've gone out, this is the third time. This time, I could just sense she was just noticing it, but I'm not sure what she was exactly thinking. 

She's a good new college friend, and a large part of her paychecks (she works a lot) go to her college tuition,, both her parents are in deep debt, she always talks about money scarcity with her, steals things, etc. 

I pay for her because, *I* have a friend who literally can just swipe her dad's card (they have money), she doesn't work at all.. can go out for lunch whenever, etc, it's normal. We'd go to a lot of places and at one point I had to awkwardly (awkwardly because of me, I've gotten better tho) be like, ""I gotta slow down with these lunches out""

I understand the feeling when a friend who has more money/doesn't care *takes you* around, and *your* money is ""worth more"" than theirs to you,, and it's just an awkward situation to stop the flow of the hangout and say, no I don't want to get food out. 

Ag anyway, I do feel really bad, because this friend hadn't eaten all day (which she does when she's home from college, idk why), and then ordered just fries at a food truck. I thought maybe it's because she doesn't want to spend a lot, and I know she hadn't eaten all day, so I was like, ""I'll pay, what do you want?"" and she was like no no i want fries, even though i kept pressing her, because I wanted her to just eat food. I don't know. I feel weird about it, because literally every single time I've paid for her shit, and then she was like, ""I'll get us a drink then"" and paid for that, I think because she felt this weird thing that I was and have been doing. I feel like an asshole

The thing is I don't have to pay for my tuition, and I have extra money to spend on things like skateboards and clothes and whatever.. it makes sense to me to pay for her. But I understand that that may not be the point? I don't know

1. Losing both her parents 
2. Being unemployed twice
3. Me suddenly asking to borrow money from her when she is unemployed 
4. Me not wishing her happy birthday and forgetting the date of her birthday 

For context, let me explain where I was last year 2022. I, too, lost employment in late 2021. I then slipped into deep depression and was clinically diagnosed. I am on medications now but starting the medications in the beginning was tough - they made me loopy and at some point even more suicidal. It took me many months to be able to get used to the medications and connect with anyone again. At this point I have not been working for 6 months. 

Since I didn‚Äôt want her to worry, I made sure to inform her about my diagnosis and how I am so out of it sometimes that I don‚Äôt even have the energy to talk to people. I did that because we are good friends. I did not tell anyone else about my diagnosis & struggle. She seemed understanding of my situation. 

Now let me explain my absence: 

1. I did not know about one of her parents passing. She did not inform me. When her parent passed, I found out later that it was during the period where I was in throes of my depression. When she lost her first parent (before I fell into depression), she told me about it and I asked how she was doing. 
2. I did not know about her being unemployed twice. She did not tell me about it until months later. When she was unemployed the first time, I was there for her. Her second unemployment happened after I was in my depression.
3. I came to her for help with finances because I was scammed of 10k while trying to get on my feet again after being jobless for 6 months. At that point I have exhausted my savings and on top of that I lost 10k to the scammer. When I asked for help she did not say she couldn‚Äôt help. I did give her an option to say no because she was also struggling. I gave back all her money and some extra one week after she lent me hers. 
4. When her birthday came I was deeply depressed about my situation (work, scam, depression) that I missed to wish her happy birthday. I know her birthday- I did not forget- but I was so down. 

We have been in contact recently but it feels different. I have been helping her to find a house because she‚Äôs decided to come back to our home country. In fact, I found a unit for her in my building. I have been helping her landlord to resolve some issues with the house, receive furnitures on behalf of her, etc. Last week she sent me some pictures without context, and when I asked what they are, her reply sounded upset that I don‚Äôt understand. (If you haven‚Äôt notice already, my friend has a tendency to expect people to understand what‚Äôs going on with her without communicating directly. In my opinion, the onus is on our own self to communicate what‚Äôs happening to us/inside us. We cannot expect people to understand.) So I was a bit frustrated with her reply and have been a bit distant. I still reply to her, but they were short. She asked me what‚Äôs wrong and I told her about my frustration and that I need some time. This is where she said she wants to end the friendship since I tend to go ‚Äúradio silent‚Äù on her.

It breaks my heart that the things she brought up are from when I was unwell with depression (still am depressed but better controlled with medications). But at the same time, I am aware that I was not there for her.  I have invited her to talk face to face about this but she isn‚Äôt responding. I don‚Äôt want to force her if she‚Äôs made up her mind but I would be lying if I say I am not sad, upset, and angry. So, how do I accept this gracefully? What if I bump into her in the lift? What would be the adult thing to do?",nymaamyn,25,26,0.77
239,Setting boundaries - how much is too much?,110a3os,"My dad was emotionally absent throughout my upbringing and did not act as a positive male role model for me growing up. He and my mum constantly fought and argued which was extremely stressful and I had to convince her to leave him a few years ago during a tearful Christmas when I returned from university to visit. As a parent he looked after my physical needs well (quite generous with money, etc.) but was hypercritical about everything. He was never flat out abusive but had a pretty short fuse, was unpredictable and a source of constant negativity. 

Fast forward to today, mum is in a long-term relationship and the three of us live together, everything is very stable. My dad lives in a dodgy flat in a nearby city and is predictably still extremely negative and bitter about the world. I visited him during the most recent Christmas and was quickly reminded why we left. 

He claims he has nobody else and clearly wants to insert himself back into our lives, when I‚Äôbe asked about his plans he always says he wants to move closer to us which personally I‚Äôm completely against. He messages me pretty frequently, sometimes its a proper message - most other times he writes one of my childhood nicknames with some emojis, or sends some pretty dumb TikToks that he finds funny. I‚Äôll always respond if he asks a question or says ‚Äúhello‚Äù, but otherwise depends how I feel. 

Lately I‚Äôve just been ignoring a lot of the random crap and he seems to be upset about it as he sends some frowning or crying emojis. I try to keep our conversations as short as possible and don‚Äôt provide too many details. My thinking is that he never cared much to know about me or mum when I was growing up, so why does he deserve to know so much now? I‚Äôve spoken to a few therapists in the past 5 years or so about setting healthy boundaries and wondering if I‚Äôm taking it a step too far. Am I wrong for acting so ‚Äúcold‚Äù towards my dad?",pharmer25,5,2,1.0
240,"I‚Äôm having trouble hearing in my right ear, but the ear doctor said my hearing‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm confused.",1107q8c,"Whenever I use headphones, I always have to adjust the left/right stereo balance to be right of 50/50. Otherwise, I almost can‚Äôt hear anything on my right side. Also, I often get tinnitus in my right ear. This has been going on for 2 years, and recently, having finally turned 26 and gotten my own health insurance, I went to an audiologist to get it checked out. 

Now, aside from the headphone problem, I‚Äôve also had to adjust the left/right stereo balance when listening to stuff on my computer without headphones at close range. Additionally, when I cover my ears with my hands and hum, I hear it better on my left side, which I read somewhere is a telltale sign of sensorineural hearing loss, so for a while I was worried I might be suffering from it and might need a hearing aid. 

However, when I went to the audiologist, and took hearing test, the results came back and said that both my ears hear equally well. Not only that, but my auditory comprehension of different words is 100%. Thus, the audiologist said my ears are probably just full of wax and recommend I clean them out with warm water. 

I got the same result when taking hearing tests via apps on my phone, but I didn‚Äôt take them seriously because it‚Äôs just an app on your phone. Surely it doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story, which why I was shocked to get the same result from an actual ear doctor. 

Then again, my hearing is my right ear, though never as good as my left, goes up and down in quality, aka it‚Äôs gets worse then better then worse again. For example, at the start of January, I was comfortable with a left/right stereo balance of 25L/75R. Then by mid January, it improved to 48L/52R. Now it‚Äôs back to roughly 25L/75R. Also, when I put my fingers in my ears and hum, my hearing is more balanced than when I cover them with my hands. 

I‚Äôm just so confused. My gut tells me this could be more than an earwax blockage, but the doctor said I‚Äôm fine. What should I do next?",anthscarb97,4,3,1.0

I am 21 right and will be entering University next September at age 22. No matter how hard I try not think about it / think about it positively I can‚Äôt help but feel like a looser about it. 

I know that thinking about the past isn‚Äôt a healthy thing to do, but I can‚Äôt help but feel a huge regret about wasting the past 3 years of my life. I went to 3 different colleges, each for a different major but I didn‚Äôt like any of them and ended up dropping out 3 whole times.

I know that it is too late and I should think about the future and not the past, but when I think about the future all I think about is the fact that no matter how hard I study during the next years, no matter how hard I try to correct my past mistakes, it won‚Äôt change the fact that I will be graduating at age 26, and that thought makes me feel like shit.

I have always been a very competitive and ambitious person, I had everything to succeed, but depression got to me and Basically wasted 3 years of my life.

I will be 22 studying with 18 years. I will graduate 3 years later than people my age. And I can‚Äôt do nothing about it. 

People say age doesn‚Äôt matter and what not, truth is it does. People in my class will look at me weird, I will still be in university while my friends have graduated long ago and are making good money, women my age will not date because will still be a student at the age of 26, my parents are ashamed of me because I had everything to succeed and didn‚Äôt.

He then goes on to badmouth one of his employees and basically say that the guy had the audacity to ""ask for more money"". He tells me that the employee in question is working around 4 hours per day and that he's getting paid $500 a week. And that I would be replacing this guy.

I'm thinking (with the sheer amount of paper that this job seems to require their employees to print) that I seriously doubt it's just 4 hours per day (because organizing all those papers would take time, too). 

Anyway, I haven't heard anything back from the guy since our phone call. I suspect it's because I wasn't sounding too enthusiastic, but that's okay. I'm kind of thinking it's a blessing because honestly looking back on what he said, sounds like a bit of a scam.

Is there anything else y‚Äôall would include that I missed? I‚Äôm especially trying to do things that are easiest during business hours, like making appointments, getting a haircut, grocery shopping, etc.

Update: it‚Äôs 7 PM and I‚Äôve done‚Ä¶ most of this! I should clarify I didn‚Äôt actually have the appointments today, just had to get myself established with all new providers. This is my first time being in charge of my own insurance, and I‚Äôm queer in a rural area, so healthcare providers felt especially scary, but I got set up with a therapist and primary care doc who are both in network and apparently both queer friendly.

In a way, I was relieved not interviewing there because it's a very intimidating place to visit because it's a meat packing plant and you have to go through security and find an unmarked door and hope you have the right one and it's just kind of an overwhelming experience on top of already being stressful enough because it's a job interview.

The bins were being kept on the neighbours drive which is at the end of the row of houses, they are the only ones with a driveway out of this block of buildings. 

Ever since they posted us a letter asking that we not access our own bins after 8:00pm as it sets of their motion detector alarm, we decided to move them to where the rest of the houses keep their bins. Where they would be is on the small sliver of land that is part of our home at the front of our house. They wouldn‚Äôt be on the pavement or in anyone‚Äôs way, and would only be two extra bins in the line of already existing bins.

The first time I went to ER I thought I had a heart attack. I was at home, working on my PC. I stood up, got horrible chest pain, couldn't draw a breath and almost collapsed to the ground. I held onto furniture and walls walking to my mom's room saying something isn't right. That turned out to be my first panic attack.

The second time I went to ER because I thought I was having kidney issues which came out partially true but I still got criticized for coming. I had pain after urinating, so strong that I was shaking. I also had a fever, lightheadedness, urgency, back pain, strong urine smell, blood and blood clots in my urine (not on period) and shortness of breath. I thought it would get better but it got worse. I couldn't even sit, lay down or sleep cause I had to go to the bathroom non-stop and the pain was so bad. I went to the ER and they looked at me like I was crazy and peeing blood clots isn't a big deal. Now I know it's not. It turned out I had a bladder infection and fluid in my kidney. They asked me why didn't I go to my GP but I just can't get to my GP that quick. I already registered for a GP visit but it's a week away and I thought it might be something more serious.

306,Musings of A 23-year-old man,10wa2se,"Hey, going to be a long story, I will leave a TLDR at the end

I  was born in a small town in India; my father was a government officer,  mom was pursuing her higher education to become a teacher. I was put in a  convent school where I was bullied and sexually molested by my  classmates. I stopped going to school, and pretended to have an illness  where I'd fall unconscious. I faked it everyday at school to save myself  from the kids.

My mom left her  education that she was pursuing in a city some 8 hours away and came  back to take care of me. I used to get beaten up a lot by my parents as a  child for running from school. However, my parents put me back in my  original school which was a small school, run by RSS (an Indian  nationalist organization that I do not support by the way) and everyone  knew me here.

This is the part  where I mention, I was always good at academics and topped every class,  even at the convent I'd score very high in mathematics but not in other  subjects because I didn't understand the English there.

I  got back to this school and things started getting better but I  realized that as I was growing up, me and my mother grew very distant.  When I was 11, I came 2nd in my class for the first time and then I  turned 12 and me and my parents got very distant. I'd always get into a  fight with them, realizing that no matter what I do, they are never  happy with me, always disappointed. However, I started studying  seriously at this point and topped my class.

In  9th grade, I started seeing some changes in myself. I started getting  tired, mentally and physically. My grades dropped, so did my aptitude  and everything. I went to the doctors at a government hospital but no  lock. The private hospital doctor gave me some medicines but my parents  being as neglectful as they were, didn't take me there for subsequent  check-ups, claiming that ""it's all in my head and I have always been a  weak kid"".

I started getting very  bad anxiety, depression, and sleeplessness, my weight fluctuated quite a  lot, from heavy to super skinny, I started getting acne. My family  never really cared to get it checked and to convince Indian parents  about this was impossible. In 10th grade, I missed the district merit by  quite a few marks and everyone was out to get me, from classmates to  teachers to parents, everyone blamed me for my downfall, not knowing  that I was self-harming because I could not understand what I was  feeling (I have cuts on my left arm).

I  found a girl online after 10th grade from Kolkata and got really into  her. Coming from a boys-only school, I didn't have much experience  talking to girls and this felt magical. We became good friends, started  sending couriers. She was 2 years older than me and she had failed 12th  grade. She came from a humble background, lived in a chawl-like place,  father worked as a computer repair man at a small store, mother was a  housewife. I really loved her a lot. I was a Hindu. She was a Muslim.  Her mother knew about us but always thought it was only me, however, we  were in a relationship. We used to exchanged birthday gifts, she didn't  have the internet other than 2G so I used to send her videos on  pendrives/DVDs which we used to watch together while on call.

I  loved her a lot but her relatives wanted her to marry a guy. Meanwhile,  she passed her 12th grade and went to a local college under Calcutta  University. I came to 12th grade. Now, her family started taking her  phone away because of which we could only talk at night when she'd sneak  into her dad's room to take away her phone. I used to go to school,  come back and sleep the whole evening to stay up at night and talk to  her.

Overtime I started getting  very insecure about her as she used to talk about how she thinks she'll  get married, mention guys and the vulgar things that they said to her  (which I think she liked as it appealed to her sexually). It would all  sound roses till now but I had started understanding that she was a  control freak. If a girl talked to me outside, it was hell, but if she  hung out with a guy alone after college, it was understandable.

Anyways,  my illness got very bad to the point that I contemplated suicide  everyday (I sometimes find old notes/diaries of mine talking about  killing myself). I started digging into it and realized I probably had  gastritis which prevented me from eating well, or digesting the food due  to which I was suffering. Apparently, eating fibrous fruits helped it,  so I took an orange from the fridge, ate it, and realized, it was true.

Started  going to the doctor alone since then, we changed like 3-4 medications  over 2 months. I started getting better. Although, I screwed my boards  and JEE (engineering entrance exam). My dad hated me for this and wanted  me to drop so I could join an NIT/IIT (top Indian engineering  institutes), but I was never someone who was crazy about  tags/brands/money.

I joined the  gym in the summer vacations after my sister's recommendation. Meanwhile,  the girl broke up with me because I couldn't be there for her because  of my illness and was talking to her to-be-fiance while we were  together, for months without telling me. I am not sure what she does now  because she isn't active on the internet too much and last I checked,  she worked as a freelance writer. I feel bad because I don't think her  education has paid off well.

I  attended a private engineering college where I started recovering, had a  girlfriend, joined a kickboxing gym, got a belt, started coaching kids,  even coached them during a tournament, started performing at local  cafes (I rap). Life was good.

I  had another girlfriend during this time, call her J, whose father barged  into my residence one day and warned me to stay away, so the girl broke  up with me. I went home 10 days later because of the pandemic where I  got passionate for lifting. I started with calisthenics and improved my  physique a lot. Meanwhile, the girl and I got back together. Not to  mention, I was a top student at my college, and always helped my girl  with her academics, even during the pandemic. Going ahead, I randomly  sat for an MBA entrance in India, cracked it and joined one of the top 3  MBA institutes in the country. Unfortunately, my girl had planned to  get a Master's in Engineering and she couldn't crack the entrance. She  finally managed to get into a top private institution but our paths  diverged.

I came from a small town  and was blinded by the city and the kind of crowd that came at the  institute. A girll, call her L, fell in love with me here (acc to her),  got very close to me, I made a mistake and cheated on J. J found out and  was heartbroken, and shamed me so much that I lost most of my friends  (which I deserved). J also gained weight, is not doing too well with her  career (although seems very happy according to my friends, probably  because she has her father's business). I wanted to push away L from my  life but she didn't and overtime, I started loving her a lot. She  literally became my family (more so because I am not close to my real  family).

However, MBA is about to  be over. We are getting companies coming here for placements. L comes  from a much stronger academic background than mine, along with good  workex at the Big 4. I have no workex as I came directly after  engineering (you can do it in India). Although, L always claimed that  her academics at MBA suffered because of my presence (I didn't do  anything to distract her), because she was always insecure that I'd find  someone else (but I literally never told her that).

Yesterday  was very tough, as the market is very bad, L appeared for interviews at  top firms but couldn't get any offer simply because the market is  horrible and companies are rolling out very less offers. I, somehow,  managed to get an offer from the Big 4 (she was targeting much better  firms than what I got) in the evening. I came out and everyone was  hugging me and congratulating me. She was also scheduled for the same  firm and role. I saw her coming towards me and ran to her to hug her,  but she pushed me away and started asking the HR to schedule an  interview for her. I thought she is just upset.

She  didn't get a schedule because the hiring requirements were fulfilled.  We all came back, people were very surprised that I managed to get  placed during this horrible time (with no brand whatsoever on my CV, I  guess I was lucky). I, along with a friend of L, tried to ensure her  that she'll get a better offer this week, we created a whole strategy to  help her through the process.

Everything  was fine, L lives with me and I requested her to sleep last night so  she could rest for the coming days, while I stayed up the whole night  preparing HR questions, completing her assignments/tests given by the  recruiters, slept at 6AM and woke up at 8:30AM (I haven't slept in days  because of the recruitment process), shot a video for her, slept again,  woke up to checkup on her. She couldn't get through a process today  simply because her background doesn't fit.

Anyways,  we were sitting in the afternoon when she suddenly started crying and  left the room. I was very tired and fell asleep after a few minutes of  texting her what's wrong. So I haven't left my room since 3 PM and it's  midnight, I was asking her if she needs help and what's wrong. The  mutual friend isn't replying as well.

She  texted me back that she knows why she didn't get the offers. This is  referring to how she has often told me that I am the reason for her poor  academics which are leading to this. But to be honest, I never intended  for that. In fact, so many times I have actually sacrificed my  work/studies to be present for her, way more than what she's ever done  for me.

I don't know but this incident is making me feel that I keep doing better in life while everyone around is doing worse.

Oh,  and I called my father last night after getting an offer from the Big  4, where I will be a consultant with a team and all. He asked me how  much I'll be making and sounded a bit disappointed that I didn't opt for  another high-paying company (because I believe that in this bad market,  it's less important for me to get a better job/salary than my peers  getting jobs). My sister said that she is extremely happy for me, and I  shouldn't think about my father's response because he is comparing with  his friend's daughter who makes more than 3x of what I make (she's 7  years older than me and we all know how inflated CTCs are in the  corporate world).

I feel like  everyone dislikes me due to some reason. I have friends who have always  supported me, in everything, they are literally the reason that I am  here today but recently I found out that my mom hates me a lot becaues  my father had her leave her career to look after me, she never wanted  to. I haven't talked to my mother in almost 2 months because everytime I  called her before that, she'd be busy and put down the phone in 30  seconds (she doesn't know about my girlfriend, my friends, what I study,  where I will be working, or anything). I don't call my father because I  feel burdended by his never ending expectations even though he cares  about money and I make more at my internships/will be making at my first  job than what he makes at retirement at a good position in the  government. I really admire my sister and I am hoping she gets a job  soon so she can be independent as she's been living with our parents  since quite some time.

Other than  this, at MBA, I couldn't make much friends because of L and because she  didn't feel comfortable. The limited friends that I made, are just as  one would expect at a top B-school, often greedy, selfish and  treachearous.

I sometimes feel  like every person in my life has just been ruined by me, be it my mom,  my college ex or L. I really hoped that my father would be proud that  his son managed to get out of a small town (I went to a very small  school that only has 250 kids from nursery to the highest grade with  abysmal facilities) to working for the Big 4 for my first job. I  wouldn't be surprised if I am actually the first one to work at this  position from my town.

I never  backstabbed anyone in MBA, never was a sycophant, never made friends  with powerful people for perks and always put in the work wherever I  could. I have had sleepless nights, working 36 hours with minimal breaks  and what not so at least I always hoped that once I get a good brand on  my CV, everyone will be proud of me, and I never really chased  validation from my father, but at this point in life, I feel like I  deserve at least a little.

TL;DR - Mother hates me for having to leave her career for me, ex hates me for cheating, current girlfriend sort of dumped me because I got a job offer when she was the one most likely to (she was expected to get a better offer, she unfortunately got none, I got one at the Big 4 which isn't what she wanted), father is disappointed that my job doesn't pay too much (I make more than him, he's retiring soon, I am starting my first job), and I feel tired.",goddawg912,0,1,1.0

what else should I do once I turn 18? and for the future, what other tips do you have?


financially, is there anything I should do(planning to get a job over the summer for the first time. so what would I do for that?). I know I should start saving for retirement once I get a job, so there's that. but is there any other financial advice you'd give to a young adult?

oh! and I'm still on my parents insurance till next year/when I turn 19. how does getting insurance work and stuff? is that an issue if I don't have insurance for a bit?

316,Military rejected me (19 M) and now I'm getting kicked out of my house in three weeks.,10wmla4,"A little back story, fresh out of high school, I've been trying to get into the military for about the last year and a half, It was drawn out for so long cause they wanted to know my entire medical history from birth (I had childhood asthma) while I was waiting I was and still am working a full time job making around $18 an hour. I never really saved a significant amount because I believed that any day now I would get a phone call from the military, drop everything, and leave. But today I realized that will no longer be the case, I got a long awaited call from my recruiter saying that my asthma waiver had been denied. 

The reason I wanted to join the military in the first place is because I feel that I have no idea what I would like to do in the real world so I figured some real world experience might help me develop some semblance of what I wanted to do with my life. 

My dad has always been someone who see's the world in black and white, and he absolutely cannot be reasoned with. We've clashed heads all my life and have merely tolerated each other. He's always been very adamant about me needing to go to college but since I had no idea what I wanted to do I decided against it, and figured that I should wait until I knew what I wanted to do so I didn't waste upwards of $100,000 on a degree in some field that I realized I hated later down the road. 

But anyways, he's been telling me it's time to ""leave the nest"" for over a year now, I didn't want to get an apartment cause I thought I'd be leaving for the military. But now that I just learned I'm not, he told me this evening that I have 3 weeks to pack my things or else he would have me ""forcibly removed"" (no joking lightheartedness here). But now I am absolutely frazzled, I have a barely functioning car, $100 to my name, and absolutely no idea what to do next. I make about $1300 a paycheck biweekly, to survive i'm feeling that I need so much more than that, can I afford a car payment (My car barely gets me from point A to B), insurance, (oh yeah he's kicking me off the insurance too) and also an apartment? I've been wanting to learn how to code but I don't want to do it out of the back of my car.

TLDR: Military doesn't want me, Dad is tired of me living at home so I have 3 weeks to get out, I'm 19 and have no idea what the hell I do next in life. I am freaking out

Edit: Here are some common questions/concerns about my situation.. I‚Äôm am a 19 year old male, currently in Fort Worth, Texas. I tried it enlist in the Navy and the Air Force but was rejected both times. The problem that prevented me from getting a waiver was that I have a caring mother who refilled my rescue inhaler prescription every year, so on paper it looks like I have asthma when in reality.. I have not used an inhaler since I was 13. I have submitted a pulmonary function test but they did not budge. I have not been paying for rent for the past year but it does sound like a great idea to offer that in exchange for more time to get my sh*t together! I‚Äôve always been interested in IT work, I have family out in Phoenix Arizona who have offered for me to come out and stay with them while I go to school, I think I will start looking at community college/ general education options out there and see if anything looks promising.

326,"Easy Target, Or Actually Ridiculous And Immature?",10wd7jc,"This is probably one of the last times I‚Äôm going to ask a question like this on Reddit. 1, I have a therapist I can and should be consulting, 2, this is Reddit‚Ä¶subject to who and whatever personality disorder they may have. 

I‚Äôve gone through some bad stuff over the past few years I am trying to move past: undiagnosed autoimmune disease crippling me and leaving me homeless because I couldn‚Äôt work/didn‚Äôt have anyone to count on financially. Almost dying from covid and the pandemic that happened. Seven years of absolute chaos and spiraling. 

I‚Äôm diagnosed now. On meds. Doing better. Have a job. But I got sick at 26 just a year out of college. I missed 26 to 32, pretty much. I‚Äôve been out of every game: work, social, romantic, etc etc. But I am rebuilding. I am working at a call center from home and am a top performer. It‚Äôs nothing I want to be doing or ever expected to do, but it‚Äôs helping me get experience and money in the bank + have benefits. 

I‚Äôm extremely insecure. I‚Äôve always sort of been, had low self esteem, but it‚Äôs out of control now. I imagine from everything that happened and being completely out of control of my own body and life. 

Today I made a post in a sub I frequent asking about office politics because I‚Äôve messed up at this job by acting obnoxious. Talking too much. Trying to make people laugh too much, etc. I‚Äôm bored there a lot of the time, so I guess I was entertaining myself. I have been working to curb it, but a few in the sub started attacking me and calling me unprofessional and just saying rude shit. I get it. I am the one who said I was unprofessional and want to work on incorporating myself into work professionalism! I even got someone who wrote some looooong thing to me about how maybe they were projecting but was I ‚Äúwhite trash‚Äù like them and how they grew up?? They went on to list how at every job some male co worker wanted to sleep with them and how they‚Äôd get fired after they did or if they didn‚Äôt. This person sounded like they had a personality disorder. I answered back nicely and they attacked me all of a sudden. 

Idk. Maybe the universe is telling me to stop asking questions to Reddit?? I‚Äôm wondering how to know who the crazy person here is. I was told I‚Äôm immature. Unprofessional. Just in my writing?? Idk. Anyone see something here indicative of that and I am crazy??",EBeewtf,4,1,0.67

Still working there. On  minimum wage unfortunately. Saddened that I could never have what everyone else has. And embarrassed to tell then I have no car, house or anything else.

335,Need some advice on job/career future.,10w34sv,"So I need some advice from those who have worked for a long time in their career or found their career down the line.

For some background on myself, I am 23, started an early career in vet med. I‚Äôve been working in the field for 5 years just about, in both ER and Clinical settings. I now work for a private clinic. I rent, not terrible cost, but I am lucky where I live currently most places don‚Äôt go for as cheap as I have right now.

This is where I start getting mixed emotions, this job is great, fairly well pay, great coworkers and great bosses. But as far as advancing their is no ‚Äòhigher roles‚Äô to acquire, and they do not offer insurance opportunity at this time, nor maternity leave(just got married, so thinking for the future family stuff.) 

So I‚Äôve dabbled in the job searching tasks, looking within my field, and outside my field. I do feel I am a Jack of all trades, quick learner, easily comfortable in new situations, and a social butterfly when I‚Äôm in work mode or in my work ‚Äòpersona‚Äô if you will. 

I want something that I can advance, or have the opportunity to get more pay, more responsibility, and insurance. I have til 26 to figure this all out, my parents are gracious enough to let me stay under them until that time comes.

I‚Äôm stuck between stay at my current job and do insurance independently, and hope I never cap out on pay, or do I find more opportunities elsewhere.

338,At what age would it be appropriate to give up on ever having a normal life?,10vwclz,"I'm 31 years old and have yet to have anything meaningful in my life.  No relationship, no place of my own, no good job, no degree, I've never been out of the state, hell I have probably only left my house less than ten times in the last six months.  The next time I'll leave the house this month is to take my cat to the vet on the 13th. Before that, I went to a store once in January, once in November, and the vet in October. That's been my only interaction with the outside world since September.


I was doing a retirement calculator yesterday and it got me thinking: what am I saving my money for when if my life stays like this, I don't want to live.  Even if I somehow became able to afford my own place, it feels like it's too late to meet a guy.  I've passed my prime in the gay dating scene. And I can't even consider a relationship until I have my own place anyway. There will never be a 30th anniversary or anything like that at this point because it would be such a late start. I had dreams to turn my writing into tv shows and movies but more realistically, all I wanted was to be loved and married and have a place of my own that isn't my childhood bedroom. 


In September, I quit my stressful, low paying job ($32,000/year) to do a stress free, very low paying job from home ($13,000/year).  Neither paid enough to live in my own anyway so I figured why have I spent the last 9 years at this place just to not be able to afford to live?
This low paying remote job has allowed me time to get certifications in coding, digital marketing, and right now I'm about 70% of the way through an online HVAC certification.  But in reality, I know when I finish that, I won't have the courage to interview for jobs because I'm afraid to be the new person.  That's why I stayed at my old job so long.  No good jobs are located around me and I can't drive more than a couple miles because I'm too anxious. The nursing home right across the street from me is always hiring maintenance technicians but I had interviewed a few years ago and was told they primarily hire women. 


Everyone on here always recommends therapy and I don't even know where to start with that. Since quitting my old job, I became eligible for Medicaid again after not having insurance for years. So I suppose I could see a doctor but I don't even know how. I never have in my adult life. And what's the use anyway? It wouldn't change anything. It feels like life passed me by and I was on the sidelines the whole time, too scared to join in and now it's too late to.  My whole life has been a waste and me being gone would make absolutely no difference to anyone but my cat.

They said ""just leave now and we'll forget about all previous agreements.""

We missed the connection by 2 minutes.... Ran exactly from the end of one terminal, to exactly the end of another. Covered in sweat and not happy. Wish us luck.

Shout out to corpo greed for fucking around and letting us find out. 

There were too many airplanes landed at SFO, so we ended up waiting at LAX for an hour on a part of the tarmac that even the pilot had never seen before lol. 

Update 12 hours later: 
It ended up being a nice side adventure! So we went and talked with customer service for 2 hours and killed her with kindness, and it really paid off. 
Some other people that were doing the same connection as us got boned until tomorrow, but our lady pulled through and got us a new flight for today on another airline. She's a real champ. I gotta say, the people out here in San Fran are REALLY nice!! We went and got a rental car, and the guy even upgraded it to a mustang convertible, that was really something. 

It sucks that we lost a day, but we ended up crossing the Golden Gate bridge for the first time, ate some good food, and met some real nice folks so it was definitely a win :) 

We're about out of here finally, thanks again everyone!

Final edit: United ended up losing our luggage due to the switch up on flights, even though they had 12 hours to move it from one spot to another. We got them back 5 days later into our 10 day trip. Never doing United again.",NullDivision,7,10,0.81

At what point should I start applying for jobs in my new city? It's a good few months away, so I don't think I should be applying now, but I also don't want to wait until the last minute and not have a job. I have enough savings I would be good maybe 2-3 months without a job.

Which step comes first, getting a job or an apartment? I currently rent from a distant family member, and it's an informal arrangement so I have no experience with a real apartment. I assume I need proof of income, but a job would probably also need my proof of residence?

I‚Äôm just feeling like, why am I the way I am, and am I truly changeable? 

I think I‚Äôve gone through life being a people pleasing punching bag. My mom is the same way, so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs learnt behavior. Though, I have always been a bit more confident than she is. I don‚Äôt mind conflict‚Ä¶as much. I don‚Äôt mind conflict as much but don‚Äôt like when I‚Äôm the subject of it and need to stand up for myself and stand firm. I get insecure. I self blame. I feel bad about people not liking or agreeing with me. I want everyone to like me. I‚Äôd always like to be agreeable. Or maybe I always want to be right so I don‚Äôt look bad. It‚Äôs very weird because I feel like I teeter very much between not giving a damn and giving a huge damn. What is that? Why is that?

I‚Äôm about to be 34. Woman. Single. No kids. No career. Overweight the majority of my life. Only thin once while a teen and starving myself. This is when everyone liked me and I felt most confident, even though I was acting like a dipshit most of the time. I guess that‚Äôs the privilege of literally fitting in? Idk. 

There are people who are my age. They have a steady career. A home. Are married. Multiple kids. And these are things I wanted for myself at this age, or thought I would have. But I got sick at 26. Undiagnosed autoimmune. And was crippled for five years until being diagnosed. My entire life spiraled out of control. I went from a college grad to being homeless from being unable to work and no one helping me. It‚Äôs been the most traumatizing experience of my life, and I‚Äôm coming out of it. Being treated. Have a diagnosis. I‚Äôm incredibly lucky for all of that. But it took five years of my life away from me and has led to more insecurity than ever. 

I screwed up at my new job. Not totally. I am a top performer there. I do good work. I am mostly professional. But for a lot of the time I wasn‚Äôt professional (saying too many jokey things. Acting sort of obnoxious. Helping other co workers with things when I should have just been minding my business, like acting as if I knew what I was doing. I did. But I shouldn‚Äôt have been butting in and speaking up so much ‚Äî wasn‚Äôt my place) and definitely made bad impressions with people I did not want to make bad impressions with. And it makes me hate myself. 

When I was sick, in the depths of it, I hated my whole life before. I didn‚Äôt like the things I did. The friends I had. The way I acted. The way I let people treat me. Idk. Maybe I‚Äôm still doing it. Still trying to please people who do not deserve my pleasing them. Maybe I‚Äôm still living in a way I shouldn‚Äôt be living at all. Unenthusiastically. Dumb job. Wasting my potential. 

How do I completely change my life? I already have started. I disconnected from people who made me feel bad about myself. Even family members. I moved further away from them. I live by the beach and love that. But I want more. I want a better career. I want a home and a family of my own. I do not want to look back at my life and STILL be filled with regrets over my choices. 

I‚Äôm not doing enough. And I‚Äôm not doing it fast enough. I have recently started therapy which I‚Äôm hopeful will help, but it‚Äôs not enough. I need to be actively doing work, too.",EBeewtf,19,29,0.91

380,How do parents find time for hobbies or projects?,10twun7,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for a question like this, but here goes...

I'm a father of 3, been married for 16 years, and we live in a fairly small house on a somewhat limited budget. Our oldest is 15, middle is 12, and youngest is 6.

I'm wondering how other parents find time for hobbies and/or projects. I feel like I only ever get a couple of hours to myself at a time, maybe once a week, which isn't really enough to accomplish anything in the grand scheme of things. I end up with a bunch of half finished projects that I eventually abandon because we get too busy or I can't afford it.

I need to work on my car and get it running, but it would probably require an entire weekend (16-20 hours) and doing it in small chunks isn't really an option. By the time I get everything set up and I remember where I left off I only have about 30 minutes to do actual work. We don't have a garage so I'm working on it in the alley behind our house, so leaving my tools set up and the car in pieces isn't an option.

I'm also a musician and when I have time I like to play guitar or write songs, but I never get around to learning new material or recording ideas because I run out of time before I get to it. If I don't record ideas while they're fresh I won't likely remember them next time I pick up the instrument. Again, since we live in a small house I can't really leave it all set up. I have to clean it all up when I'm done because much of our home is shared space in one way or another.

Those are just 2 examples, and it seems like there are countless other projects and activities that I want or need to do but I can't find the time or money. How do you other parents do it?! I know people that have kids and work full time who somehow have time to build amazing things, create art, spend meaningful time with their family, go to the gym, garden, and still keep the house clean.

388,Possible Sublet Scam‚ÄîNeed Advice.,10tgj5d,"**Not sure if this is the right sub to post this. I know this is a long post but thanks for reading. Any advice is greatly appreciated.**

I (24F) recently had to put my apartment up for sublet due to financial reasons. I posted in several FB groups advertising. 

Someone (will refer to her as K) reached out via phone call (Feb 2-Thursday) and claimed they are a parent and are looking for an apartment for their daughter. K claimed that they have a son living at the complex and already filled out an application for the daughter but no units were available.

K asked when the lease starts and ends (Jul 2023-Jul 2024). K offered to pay the 23-24 lease in full ($12,060). K claimed to have a stipend that was expiring night of the phone call (Feb 2) and offered to pay the remainder of my current lease ($5874). Final total of $17,934.

I was told that in order for K to pay I would need to provide my login information to my resident portal so they could add the method of payment to my account. (I know very stupid of me to do that). I did delete all my payment methods before doing that.

The payments were broken up into 4 and I received e-receipts for them. As of now I can still see the credit balance on my account. When I went to look at the stores payment method the bank account K added was a Varo Savings Account and she had put my name as the account holder. I don‚Äôt have a Varo account at all. This is part of the scam I‚Äôm guessing.

K then asked me to send over half of Feb rent which is $489. Asked me to send through CashApp but that wouldn‚Äôt work. I then said I have Chime and K said her husband did as well so I stupidly sent it through there.

On Friday, Feb. 3, I was asked to send K an additional $2459. I told her I don‚Äôt have that kind of money right now. K asked if I knew anyone who could loan me the money. I told her I don‚Äôt know anyone who could loan me the money.

Due to my financial situation I offered a payment plan to pay the $2459 by May by paying $600 in February and $783 a month March-May.

K didn‚Äôt like that. K claimed her husband said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs too far out‚Äù. K said she (and husband) can‚Äôt wait until May for me to pay. K asked once again about getting a loan from someone. I asked when she needs the $2459 in full and didn‚Äôt get an answer.

At this part I was confused cause I really don‚Äôt remember anything about a down payment. K then said that me paying 75% of that was the ‚Äúcorrect amount for the down payment‚Äù which is $735. I was asked if I could pay $246. I offered to pay next week (Feb 8) cause I won‚Äôt get paid until then. They said they want the $246 that day (Friday, Feb 3).

I refused and stated again that I don‚Äôt have the money and already sent them all I had (like a dumbass). I didn‚Äôt receive a response after that. I then called my mom and she said it‚Äôs probably a scam and that the payments will bounce. My mom told me not to respond until I informed my apartment‚Äôs leasing office.

I met with the office and contacted the accounting department. The accounting department said to change login info and to not send them anymore money as K can dispute the charges with her bank and keep my money. Also suggested to get a full name and see if they started the relet process.

I sent a follow up text to K stating that the best way to contact me is by text and that I‚Äôm unable to send anymore money until next week. Also told her that if she wanted me to I can send over her name and email to the leasing office to get started on the relet paperwork.

All of Friday K kept calling but I was too scared to answer and only felt comfortable communication through texts. Plus my mom said not to answer after I sent that last text.

Come Friday evening K sent a text saying her husband said if I paid $100 today they can move forward with the payment plan I told them. I didn‚Äôt respond to that. Then she sent a text claiming that her husband wants to press charges to get their money back cause I haven‚Äôt been responding.

After that text I called my mom crying and told her about the text. My mom said that I‚Äôd trying to scare me into sending her more money and to just ignore K.

I think this is a scam and I‚Äôm very worried. I got excited that I potentially found someone to sublet so I wasn‚Äôt thinking straight. My mom says that the money that was paid is going to bounce in a few days since it was a large payment.  Now I don‚Äôt have money to pay Feb rent on time and I feel like an idiot for doing this to myself.

I know K initiated the payments cause she added the bank account but I know I have some blame to this. I did reach out to Varo bank and explained the situation and asked if there‚Äôs anything they can do.

Do y‚Äôall think this is a scam? Or is it legit? Any advice and/or opinions are welcomed.

All the while neglecting to take ownership for any of her behavior.

I would then simply alert my local PD telling them to not waste resources on me. Tell my parents I'm leaving for a trip to San Diego and from their bolt to my new life. I am even thinking to get a storage unit where I can store random pieces of furniture I can find to move with me to New York.

I am okay with you labeling me as an asshole. I am okay with you labeling me as immature. But a part of me is thinking this. Me going to therapy the last year has made me really rethink the inaction of my life, and I am desperate to do something because I am not happy.

If this happens for better or worse, no contact means no contact. And it's to the point that if my mom and dad were to pass, I wouldn't even attend their funerals. Not even for my own brother (who bullied me as a kid). I would also plan to forego any will my parents leave behind for me. If I do this, I am gone. This is the plan many years into the future when that day comes. I would actually hope that I am never informed when it happens and I just learn it randomly 5 years later.

I'll try to be respectful to all the replies if I feel compelled to respond. I know that I can be a difficult person at times. So, what ramifications am I facing?

The fact is, my relationship with my family has never been one where I can open up and be myself.",BloodyBloodshot,72,97,0.9

427,"I wanted a more stable life, now I hate and and I feel stuck and depressed",10rf15v,".... and I don't know if it's me, or the circumstances, or or or. Advice welcome.

I'm about to turn 35 years old. The past 12+ years were exciting - I studied abroad in college, then I got a job that allowed me to work from anywhere in the world. Over the years, I lived in 7 different countries and traveled to over 40. I was single for most of it, I enjoyed my life a lot, even when I felt lonely because of being by myself most of the time. I didn't own a lot, I just lived out of my backpack, and that was fine.

Three years ago, when I lived in Mexico, I met my now-husband. We fell in love, and traveled the world together for another 2+ years. It was absolutely amazing, but eventually both of us got a little tired of all the traveling, and we started craving stability, a place to call our own, a baby eventually. I'm from Europe, he's from the US, and we decided to settle in the US for various reasons. We got here in late October last year, and I haven't been very happy since, for several reasons.

One of them is the place we're living. It's a popular place, and I liked the idea of it, but in reality I don't love it here, at least not in winter. It's gray, cold and rainy every single day and I've always hated that kind of weather (I'd prefer snow over that!), it affects me. Also, it isn't walkable at all and you need the car to go everywhere, which I know is normal in the US, but hard for me as someone from Europe who's used to very walkable cities and public transport. I never had a driving license, and as I'm still waiting for my visa to be processed, I can't drive, so I'm basically just stuck at home all the time, unless my husband drives us somewhere, or I take an expensive Uber. Even when I need to go to the doctor or get a haircut I have to ask my husband to drive me. Right now, he's on a business trip (the second time within two months) and I'm just alone stuck at home. It's hard this way to make friends too, since I can't get around, and also it's quite a small place with not a lot of meetups or anything like that. Last but not least, I don't love our place either, I agreed to it because my husband loves it, but I'm unhappy with it, because it's really dark and we don't even have a nice couch to sit on. I have a job, at least, I work remotely so that keeps me busy at least. 

I've cried a few times and my husband feels bad for me and consoles me, but also doesn't really understand. He's happy here, he loves it here. He also has his business trips, and he can drive. I feel like a bird in a cage. I can't even leave the country for an unknown amount of time, until I get my Green card.  During the week I just feel mostly depressed, and even on the weekends I'm not as happy as I used to be. I'm also blaming myself for it - I wanted a stable life and now I have it, and I don't like it. The thought of being stuck here for years, maybe even getting pregnant and buying a house, absolutely terrifies me.  Months ago, I was so positive about the future. I wanted to buy a house, make friends, have a baby in the next year or two. Now I just wish our lease already ran out and I my husband and I could go to a different place, try again. Even though I don't know if that changes anything. I sometimes wish we could just move to Europe, anywhere in Europe. But my husband is happy here, and his job requires him to stay in the US. And breaking up with him is not on the table at all, by the way. He's now the only good thing in my life, he's absolutely wonderful and without him I would probably cry every day being here. I love him so much. 

Sorry for making this so long. I just don't know what to do. I feel stuck, I feel sad all the time, I'm constantly researching where else in the US we could live instead, but then I'm scared that wer move there and I'll just feel the same agai . I don't know.

428,How should I (F2O's) handle this situation in a professional manner? It's quite disrespectful.,10rd9ym,"This coworker (F 20's) repeatedly answers and/or acts on my behalf. For example, if someone states x(me), can you help me with y? Or do you know y? The individual in question will insert herself into the situation, and answer before I can respond.

Addressing the concern or matter that was directed at me. It seems to verge on undermining behavior. It doesn't help that the person asking, ignores her behaviour.

I find this quite disrespectful, and I would like to put an end to it. How would you navigate this situation in the moment? And/or afterwards. And what if they ignore you (in the moment or afterwards), and keep on doing it? If I had to describe this individual, they would likely fall on the vindictive and/or spiteful side, and a bit arrogant/hypocrtitcal. If I were to tell her to stop in the moment or after she would likely retaliate or become spiteful. If and/or when I needed her help she would become quite problematic about it. I am also concerned that addressing the matter in the moment might make the the other side (the individual asking the question) uncomfortable, or lengthen the conversation beyond what's needed. 

Unfortunately, difficult people exist, so if I don't address it with her, I'm afraid I won't know how to do so with the next person. Neither do I want to be complacent to someone undermining and/or disrespecting me (especially if it's purposeful).

I've since grown SO much maturity wise, have gone through some shitty life events and have come to realize the kind of people I want to surround myself with.

This friend is the type of friend who can't have deep conversations (and I say this because we really don't have much in common, even our values are entirely different now), more often than not acts very selfishly/entitled (always thinks guys HAVE to do things for her, friends should offer to buy her dinner if it's her congratulatory dinner, only likes to do things together that she likes, doesn't take people's personal life into account and always gets mad at them) loves to drink and smoke (nothing wrong with this but she CONSTANTLY is doing it and it's uncomfortable for me because she will try to also get me to do it). She's left me before at functions because she was mad at me and I was by myself at night with random guys, rarely takes accountability or apologizes. She gets mad at people for doing the same thing. So little self awareness. She has also told me other people's business without me asking including peoples relationship problems which I genuinely did not want to hear about and cut the convo short about. She is not a horrible person and has redeeming qualities to her, and I'm sure has changed a lot too since we both met but I just genuinely feel like we are two different people now and I don't feel happy around her.

This isn't to say I'd cut off the friendship, we have a lot of mutual friends and when we are in a group it's fine. I have one very good friend who feels the exact same way about her and she's the only friend I've ever discussed this with. I don't want a close relationship with her. I don't really want to hang out 1:1. If I'm being honest, I don't trust her as a friend. And it even surprised me that she recently asked me to hang out. I felt bad and so I offered another day because I was genuinely busy, she couldn't do that day but offered to hang out during the week after work. To be very very honest, i don't want to. I don't want to hang with her after work (I'm usually stressed out and burnt out and like my alone time). We had planned to go to a concert with a lot of our friends in a couple of weeks so I offered to do drinks and dinner at some bar before then but she wants to meet before for a mani pedi. 

Any advice on what I can do? In some ways, i don't think it's wrong for me to shift the friendship. We have changed. It's part of life. And to me, after months of this weird distance stuff it didn't seem like she was bothered by it either. I wonder if she wants to talk about the shifting friendship and how she feels, but I personally don't want to get into it.",craqworld,3,2,1.0

467,I'm unsure what to do with my life,10pw37o,"I'm 21 years old and live with my parents. I got my life insurance license on October 2022. Life insurance sales is commission only & i didn't make any sales & ran out of money for leads. Yes, the insurance agency i was working for did not have free leads. I actually did not know that other insurance agencies offered free leads. I am currently completely lost and unsure of what to do with my life. I've been thinking about getting an on-site job but i don't know where. If anyone could drop suggestions it would be nice. I've never had an on-site job & i've been really picky with on-site jobs because i have this bad habit of wanting to be as comfortable as possible working from home & life insurance sales met that criteria, however not only was i not making money but i was miserable. Selling insurance was not for me. Most other jobs are minimum wage but everyone starts somewhere i guess. I have a car that's under my parent's name, i'd love to have a car under my name someday. Preferably something sporty & practical like an Infiniti Q50 or Dodge Charger Daytona but i know that would eat my pockets for sure, considering that i'd like to add cosmetic mods to my future car.. Also considering the fact that purchasing a new car would probably set me back from purchasing a home in the future. Q50's go for around $18,000 USD & Daytona Chargers go for about $35,000 USD.

When I was in high school i was so motivated & eager to learn. I also had all these plans for after high school. I have no clue how i was able to wake up at 6am everyday for more than a decade without a doubt. Now i absolutely do not have the willpower to wake up to an alarm and have 0 idea what to do with my life. I feel like a failure. I feel like i'm disappointing all of those who thought i was going to be doing something big after high school. The only good thing i have going on in my life is that i work out consistently and that i help around my parents house with chores and remodeling. I only have $251.95 USD to my name and have no credit history. A career in personal training is not an option because i'd have to go and hunt for clients myself and hope that they don't cancel on me.

469,How to manage stress when you have no choice but to be stressed?,10pv7ub,"All the stress management advice on the internet is about getting rid of the thing that is stressing you out - but what if you cannot? Then how do you manage stress when you're in stress? Should you be eating something specific? Packing on the nutrients as much as possible? That's the type of advice I thought I'd read... 

What do you do when you are mid stressful - long days with lots of work - and want to make it out as healthy as possible? 

The reason I asked; The next six months of my life are about to horrible. I am juggling several huge projects that are going to require more work then I have ever put in. All of them are non-negotiable and are time-specific. And life will resume normal after the six months. I know some people put in 16 hour days THEIR WHOLE LIFE and live to tell the tale. How do they do it?   


I also think adding things to this schedule is unrealistic. A lot of advice to manage the long-day-lots-of-work stress is to add an exercise routine, add a hobby, add quality time with loved ones. But again, we're in the eye-of-the-storm.

471,Apology That Was Never Acknowledged By Colleague. Can‚Äôt Stop Cringing Over It.,10pptp8,"I work from home. One of my managers, we‚Äôll call them Nathan, seemed really cool. I felt like we had a chill work relationship. 

I worked really closely with them for a few months while I was new. Of course, because I‚Äôm a dumb fck (also because I hadn‚Äôt had any real human interaction outside of my family and doctors over the past several years due to chronic illness (now diagnosed autoimmune and doing MUCH better!!) and the pandemic), I formed a bit of a crush on Nathan. 

Nathan is my superior. I have a feeling Nathan is a few years younger than me, double barf, but he has the HOTTEST voice. After not hearing hot voices for a long time, idk, I guess it was just going to happen. They were also so funny and chill and patient seeming. Traits I like a lot.

So we work together for a few months. Blindly. Can‚Äôt see each other. Only over chat and voice calls. Then one day corporate decides we must ALL be on webcam everyday once a day before the day starts. And any other large meetings. I‚Äôm suddenly like, shoot! I didn‚Äôt want to be seen. A lot of people were not happy about this. But it was good. So many of us were living in fantasy. I was acting stupid and being into someone I didn‚Äôt know other than hearing their voice. 

Either way, we all go on cam and now we see each other all the time. Nathan is not my type but damn I find him hot because of previous interactions. So I think I probably became even more insecure and said even weirder shit while we interacted ‚Äî you know, like a twelve year old even though I am in my thirties. And then one day he just sort of turns extremely cold. It may have been universal, but it felt pointed. So I apologized for being obnoxious over chat sometimes. Tried to be lighthearted. Told them I regret if I made them see me in a way that I did not want to present myself professionally. 

They don‚Äôt acknowledge the apology. I really don‚Äôt think I did anything to them. I‚Äôve even had people tell me that I‚Äôm stupid for apologizing at all. Apologizing for what, acting too funny and being too enthusiastic? But I think I came on too strong while working my way into the company culture. In some spaces, it is very casual. In others, professional. I‚Äôve found my balance now, but it‚Äôs so awkward with Nathan. I‚Äôm certain he doesn‚Äôt think anything of me other than I‚Äôm annoying and they‚Äôd rather not interact with me. But that hurts me lol. For obvious reasons.

Hoping to gain some insight/care from the Reddit Community on this one. Can anyone help?

If there's a different sub-reddit for these types of things, please feel free to provide.

The facts:

1. My dad (76 years old) is currently in the hospital after a severe episode of dementia/psychosis. He has been there the past 10 days.
2. His baseline is fairly strong. He's able to have conversations, drive himself around, generally take care of himself, and is rarely forgetful. It does not appear he will return to this baseline after this extended hospital visit
3. His health is improving, but the hospital won't discharge him unless he's living with a family member or under 24 hour care. My family lives in Chicago, and we have no family in the Chattanooga area. I am not able to move to Chattanooga to be with him.
4. He is on disability and on a fixed income of <$1500 a month.
5. He has medicare, but does not yet have medicaid (although I started the application process). Admittedly I didn't know the difference, as I am 29 years old and have never been through anything like this.

The main questions:

1. I (and my sibilings) cannot afford to put him in a nursing home or another care facility that costs a lot. What are some alternative options or insurance/medicaid/medicare covered options? Any examples of success? My current understanding is that medicaid is the most likely to cover.
2. Any ballpark idea as to how long it takes to get him placed into a facility like this? My current understanding is that he will need to go straight from the hospital to the new facility.

For context, I am traveling out of my home country (United States) to Europe for a few months and my passport expiry date overlaps with my travel time, so I needed to apply for a new passport using the DS-11 form. **My flight leaves at the end of February.**  


I filled out the form online and submitted it at the passport office, and although the person behind the counter seemed a little confused, there was a language barrier and I didn't quite understand what the problem was and they said that they would work it out. We went ahead with the application and she submitted it.   


Afterwards, I had a copy of my form that they made and I wanted to look it over to see what they were talking about and I noticed a huge error -- I had put a title in the space for suffix on the form, making my last name filled out as ""Lastname Mr"" 

^((egregious, I know, but cut me some slack please))  


I paid for expedition of my form in all the areas I could totaling out to about $300. Me losing this money is unfortunate, considering I'll likely need to go through the process again and pay the same fees once more, but my primary issue is **whether or not I'll be able to do another passport application and receive it in time**.  


The call center for passports was unhelpful and just told me ""it's up to them whether you'll need to submit another one and whether you'll get your money back"", which I'll take as Bureaucratic for ""I wouldn't know"".  


**What should my next step be?** Should I make an appointment for another passport application? There is an extra-expedited option for if my travel is within two weeks, but I can't find a concrete answer on for when I should make my appointment for.

491,Life advice for someone getting kicked out at 18?,10oqatk,"
Unfortunately i live in a toxic household where 
Financial abuse 
Emotional abuse
Physical abuse
And mental abuse is very common
In fact i deal with all of those on the daily basis 
And unfortunately one parent has a very serious condition (munchausen by proxy)
And at the age of 17 my ‚Äúloving parent‚Äù thought it would be ok to tell doctors I‚Äôm mentally incompetent 
Even though i am not 
The only thing i really have is dyslexia and anxiety and the anxiety part is because of the ‚Äúloving family‚Äù

But i was put into a program that costs 1k+ every 6 months and isn‚Äôt being paid by me or family but it‚Äôs paid by the state so if i drop out of the program i will have to pay it all back but i have 2yrs left in the program 

So ‚Ä¶unfortunately i will be kicked out of the house at my current age of 18 and i don‚Äôt hace a credit card because that ‚Äúparent‚Äù has me under some disability thing where i cant work a certain amount of hours and i can‚Äôt get an apartment anywhere because i don‚Äôt have a credit card

My parent controls every aspect of my life I‚Äôve been physically abused for a large portion of my life and I‚Äôve taken a lot of blows to the head so my memory isn‚Äôt that great 

Also I dont have a car 

**[EDIT]
Also how can i find good jobs once i leave the current job i have 
Sorry if my post is all over the place I‚Äôm kinda paranoid that this will get found** 

So my question is ‚Ä¶
If i was so sneak and apply for a credit card do i have to pay fees monthly or only when i use it
But I‚Äôm scared that they‚Äôll find out if i do that

Where are some cheap places in America that i can move 

I do have one family member off grid in Texas so i could live there for a month or three so if anyone knows where i can move in Texas that‚Äôd be great 

I‚Äôm just more curious on where i could go and move for some time while i get situated

I do what I can to keep myself busy and am proactive, but it feels there are external forces making it hard to enjoy things these days-uncertain job market, boring/meaningless jobs, difficulty maintaining friendships when people this age are focused on their own selves and seeking meaningful relationships in an increasingly digitalized/selfish world. I am wondering if others can relate and offer insight or at least understanding.** 

Hello all,

I am in my early thirties and entered this decade at the peak of the pandemic. Not sure if what I'm feeling is a typical adjustment to a new decade or after effects of the pandemic (I imagine a bit of both). I work from home with a job where I don't have much to do and while I'm very grateful to have a job and a certain level of flexibility, I feel like even though I'm doing everything I can to keep myself busy and productive (online courses, crocheting, exercise, building legos, cooking), sometimes the mundaneness/boringness of it all really gets to me. I hardly see people at all working remotely and have tried to change that by going to more local events in my area, meetups, bff app lunches/dinners. When I go to events and spend time with people, I'm transiently distracted and very extroverted, then find myself coming to my room, bored and sad again. 

I'm very proactive with making plans with people and literally taking every opportunity I have to get out of the house as much as possible. If I don't keep up, then people will never keep up with me. I never realized I would find myself in such a friendless place at this decade. It feels like I'm so easy to fade in the background and be forgotten because most people at my age are very ""set"" with who their friends are or just want to spend time with their families or significant others.

My parents are from a collectivist culture and I grew up with strong values of hospitality that I feel like are sort of becoming obsolete in this day and age. Before, people would go out of their way to do things for others but now I feel like everybody is in their own world and sort of proud of it. It kind of sucks lmao when you're somebody who doesn't feel like you have a sense of belonging anywhere while everybody else has already found their place.

In the beginning when social media was becoming popular, I found it a really great tool to meet and talk to likeminded people from all over the world. But now the increasing digitalization of life and society feels kind of overwhelming at times. Particularly when it comes to ""dating""-which I did not imagine which would be this insanely difficult. I was never too eager about being in a relationship just for the sake of not being single, but always believed in a possibility I can find somebody who loves me for who I am with whom I can share a mutual sense of interest, empathy and trust. Now I feel pretty much at the verge of hopeless. I joined dating apps even though I was not fond of the concept and wrote a great bio and do all the things to initiate conversation. I feel like not a human on there but just a item to be placed in a shopping cart. I hardly get matches at all and feel it's largely because I'm not as conventionally attractive or prettier than other people though I'm not bad looking either. The responses to this complaint are always like: ""go to the gym"", etc. which I find extremely ridiculous because 1. I am a pretty fit person 2. I always believed in a love that transcends looks, etc. bc at some point people will not look the same or remain the same weight-is that a reason to not be worthy of love? Idk lmao. When I do get a few matches, it's guys who have no enthusiasm/energy while I'm leading the conversation, or guys who instantly unmatch after I open the conversation. There were very rare times where guys even though we found we had nothing in common would keep messaging me constantly even after I clearly stated I am no longer interested in keeping in touch and wish them well. This makes using apps so unfavorable to me and while I go back on time to time, I find myself in a much better place not having to use them. I wish it wasn't so difficult to meet people organically at this age, but it feels like there are very few viable alternatives outside of apps unfortunately. 

I do therapy and have been doing therapy for over 10 years. I do have anxiety and depression and have been working on that. But my depression isn't just something that happens out of nowhere in most cases-I'm strongly influenced by the environment around me. When I feel like I'm dedicating my time doing things that feel purposeful, fulfilling and creative and around people with whom I can be myself around, my mood completely changes. But I feel like as an adult, it's been very difficult to do things that feel fulfilling when doing a boring 9-5 job and when you feel like you have to put SO much energy to maintain relationships around you. I remind myself to be grateful for things, but it does sometimes feel like people win the lottery at friendships, relationships and jobs and it feels so alienating in a world where people find what they have an abandon you. Idk. Do others feel this way? Any advice or understanding would help.",thro0waway217190,6,20,1.0
495,Buying a Car Question,10oixlt,"I've purchased many cars since I've been an adult, but all have been used cars. I'm now looking at a new to me vehicle, and in looking at used cars, the price of a 2021 certified, pre-owned version, with average mileage of what I want is comparable in price to a new version. It's within $2-4k. I'm so torn between buying a 2-year-old CPO and buying a new car. Benefits of a new car are that I know how it will be driven for any miles put on it, plus I don't have to worry about if maintenance was performed, etc. The big benefit of a CPO is a much longer warranty (more than 60,000 miles over the new warranty), and the other might be saving a little money, plus a car that's 2 years newer.

I‚Äôm an immigrant who lived in the US for a long time. I was brought up with a penny pinching mindset after my family and I struggled to adjust here. 

Fast forward to now. I‚Äôm 28, I live with a roommate in a an old two bedroom apartment and I make 90k. My current share of the rent is $500 and I‚Äôve been here for 5 years now.

This apartment did what it meant to do. I paid off my student loans thanks to living so cheaply. I saved up a 10k emergency fund. I got to travel a little bit. I put more money in Roth and 401k. I think my total net worth is 50k. So looking at the numbers, I‚Äôm doing fine.

Now I‚Äôve always wanted to live on my own, close to city center, in a really nice one bedroom, large windows and all the amenities I never had (dishwasher, in-unit laundry). I also have a car and additional parking costs up the ass. If I were to live on my own that would cost me anywhere from 1.7-2k a month! That‚Äôs just a huge jump from my current expenses for rent!!! That‚Äôs also nearly half of my paycheck and that also fucks with my head because I always heard the standard rule should be ‚Äúrent is a third of your income‚Äù. When I look at apartments that cost less they are pretty much not in the area I want to be in, or are super outdated.

Some of you might ask,‚Äù why not move out with this roommate to a nice place?‚Äù. Nope. I‚Äôm trying to get away from her, she‚Äôs awful. But I stuck through it for years bc I needed to pay off my debt.

I really want to live on my own. Embarrassingly I never have. I lived with my ex when I moved out of my parents and then with a roommate. I feel like it‚Äôs about time I make a jump to live on my own but I find it scary. Not only because of expenses but also job security and current job market. My company just had massive layoffs again which I survived but I‚Äôm worried about the company‚Äôs future prospect because they are NOT doing well.

Company basically tried to fire me this week, after I was injured from repetitive stress/motion on the job and saw a doctor filed it on worker‚Äôs compensation because that is the thing my supervisor said to do, which I can prove in a screen shot. But since I basically only report to one person, my supervisor‚Äôs reasoning for trying to get me fired was his alone. I‚Äôve talked to CEO, not about the illegality of trying to fire me when on workers comp, but just to clear the air and start with a clean slate. Though, the fucking problem is my supervisor has been friends with the company CEO for 25 yrs and I think is only gonna ever leave when he retires. It‚Äôs a small company.
However, I feel that I should have a legal opinion on all this or some person to help if in the future things go sour. I‚Äôm not gonna quit cause I‚Äôve done nothing wrong beside not being a machine for my supervisor, but also doing his job in one aspect for the last month and feeling under appreciated. And for my skill set and licensing the job pays top dollar. If they were disappointed in my work ethic than why was I training someone else- were they basically asking me to train my replacement (I felt echoes of this but thought the workload was growing and it‚Äôs not the answer)
Though I‚Äôm on workers compensation- I‚Äôm only getting a week off and because of probationary laws on claims it‚Äôs only going to be 2 days pay and covering the urgent care and X-ray bills. It‚Äôs arthritis technically, but again my supervisor told me to put it on workers comp at the doctor visit! 

Does anyone know anyone in the MD or NY areas? The offices or just someone who knows worker‚Äôs comp laws? I work in MD, pay MD income taxes, but the company is based in NY. I‚Äôd hope, since they also tried to fire me in a written email, after I had already started the worker‚Äôs comp claim-someone in HR or someone will tell them they‚Äôre fucked and they probably shouldn‚Äôt think about firing me for like for ever or else I‚Äôll win unemployment and on top of it maybe sue for damages.

He was really compelling and I just closed up shop after that.  I had proved I could do it and it no longer interested me.

Another example, one day I got a wild idea to become a stock broker.  So I did.  Studied a couple weeks, got a form to sponsor me and I aced my series 7 and 63 (I think.  I could be wrong on the second one) on my first try.  Within a year I was placing $10,000,000 trades for executives of our client companies while browsing reddit on my second monitor.  I proved I could do it and was no longer interested.  

I was driving for Lyft part time and found a good strategy but it took time to get it set up manually, so I taught myself java and wrote an app that directly interacted with the Lyft driver app to automatically collect scheduled rides.  I could have taken the time to polish the app and released it, but once again I just lost interest.  

A few months I got interested in making music and figured out how to write and publish a couple songs to Spotify.  One got picked up by a playlist and actually did pretty well for a while.  But since I proved to myself that I could make music people enjoy, I lost interest and didn't put anything else out.

The last example to keep this relatively short, I took up photography a while ago and quickly started to win awards for my portraiture.  

You'd think that with that kind of background I could have eventually made something for myself, but I'm stuck as a delivery driver for Amazon.  I'm out there every day ruining my body in below freezing weather for crap pay and benefits.

My focus is weird though.  When it's on, it's like I turn everything else off in my life and can do some pretty neat things.  It only lasts for a brief time though and once it's gone, it's gone and thus often unintentionally burns bridges.  When I try re-tackle the task, I often can't make sense of what I was doing in the first place and if I push it, I will most likely break something.

If you've read this far, thank you.  I know that was a lot.  But I don't know what to do from here.  How do people actually focus on something long enough to get anywhere with it? I thought possibly I had ADHD, but when I talked to a psychiatrist she said that was impossible given what I've been able to accomplish.

How do you pick one thing to go with? I know if I could just stick with something long enough I could raise my family out of poverty, but I just can't seem to keep it together that long no matter how hard I try.

524,I feel like I am adulting too much.,10n5059,"I‚Äôm a 19 year old college student in my sophomore year. I‚Äôve done 3 internships, got a promotion later from one of those, worked several amazing jobs and gotten great recommendations from previous employers for new jobs, and make relatively good money for my age (anywhere from $16- $25 dollars an hour). I nanny for some great families, and those families recommend me to other families to expand my reach. I do political work, and engage with my community so much that people recognize me and I don‚Äôt even know their names sometimes. My resume is 3 pages long. I volunteer at the food bank regularly. 

Yes, I am aware I am bragging. I am very proud of my achievements, and have worked so hard to get here. The odds have been stacked against me as a former foster care youth, so I am truly grateful for all of the opportunities I get, including being in college. 

But I don‚Äôt have many friends. I have a bunch of coworkers, so many acquaintances, and a few friends, but not close female friends. I struggle with close friendships, especially with men (which has gotten better, but not by much), and I find it difficult to get into a relationship since I‚Äôm not over my ex. He‚Äôs in a new relationship, so I have stopped trying to win him back since he‚Äôs obviously happy. But moving on is hard. And I found a guy who is great and really likes me, but I am afraid I‚Äôll drive him away with my issues. 

I never go out Friday nights since I work. I will eat at 8am on the days I have class and won‚Äôt eat again until 6pm. I have so much money that needs be paid off on my credit card (although I haven‚Äôt missed a payment). I‚Äôve been sleeping more. I‚Äôm depressed since I‚Äôve been fighting with my roommates. I‚Äôm stressing over where I am gonna live next year. And so many of these things are out of my control, but I still worry all night about these fears.

I feel like my resume and work experience is the only ‚Äúgood‚Äù thing about me. I would trade any popular girl her social life for my work experience sometimes.

There isn‚Äôt a particular issue here to be solved. It just makes me sad that the life I picture for myself in 5-7 years is living in a beautiful one bedroom apartment, working a 9-5, but never going out with friends since I don‚Äôt have any and not being able to maintain a relationship since I work so much.

Does anyone have a ball park on how expensive it would be to install? Online is giving a huge range of $5000-$10,000, which is understandable depending on size of the unit/house. But I‚Äôm thinking it should be closer to $5000 since it‚Äôs not a huge house and the duct work is already in place.

As well as ""well I better accept the pay whatever it may be, it's already a miracle they accept me anywhere""

572,addicted to sleeping?,10lh5ab,"I (23F) go through phases in my life where I sleep way too much. No amount makes me feel rested, it‚Äôs the main thing I think about during the day, and I‚Äôve even had issues falling asleep in random places. Not in a narcoleptic way (to my understanding), but like my willpower is just too weak to resist napping even if it‚Äôs at a weird place (desk, car, couch, tables, floors).

I have been on Zoloft and Wellbutrin for a few years for depression and anxiety. I felt like the Zoloft sedated me, so I got prescribed the Wellbutrin on top of that to make me feel human again, but I still struggle with the sleepiness from time to time. This is the first time I‚Äôve had an issue on the current dosage. I am trying to wean off, but I‚Äôve been on this dosage for a few months so I would have expected this to affect me sooner.

I am terrified of this impacting my work performance. I‚Äôve been oversleeping and scrambling to get out of the house on time. I like to wake up early so I have time to spend with my dog before crating her, but I haven‚Äôt been great at that lately. I have my own office and very little accountability at work, so I likely could steal away a few naps, but I have deadlines coming up and goals I‚Äôve set for myself that will require a lot of focused time.

I try to have good sleep hygiene. My mattress and pillows are very nice and I sleep great. I avoid eating or drinking before bed, keep my room pitch black and silent, and go to bed around 10 or 11 every night and usually get 8 hours. I drink coffee in the mornings but try not to have caffeine past 2 pm. I eat very healthy and don‚Äôt drink too much alcohol - maybe a glass of wine or 2 every other night, and never right before bed. I exercise regularly and am in good shape. It doesn‚Äôt feel like caffeine helps much.

It‚Äôs weird to me that I have such little will power when it comes to staying awake, because I usually have a lot of willpower. I quit vaping cold turkey almost a year ago, and I thought that meant I could do anything!

I don‚Äôt feel like doctors take this very seriously when I talk about this. If they do anything, it‚Äôs just upping the meds, and that doesn‚Äôt really help. It‚Äôs getting out of hand though. I slept through a dog walking gig and through a therapy appointment, costing me $130. I don‚Äôt have the energy to workout or exercise my dog like I want to. At a past job, I even fell asleep during a meeting once. I feel the same anywhere from 6 hours to 12, and it‚Äôs never well-rested.

I find this so embarrassing and immature but I don‚Äôt know how to make it better. I would really appreciate any advice/input on how to‚Ä¶ not be sleepy forever, I guess. This isn‚Äôt sustainable for the life I want to live.

TL;DR: I am so sleepy all the time, it‚Äôs heavily interfering with my life, and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it.",corgiluvr1210,23,13,1.0

But I imagine it probably wanes as we get older and start to better understand who we are/our place in the world? I don't think I fully understand that yet. I don't like my job/feel like a failure/don't really know what I would rather do, etc. It's made me really stuck in my head. I have trouble even watching/reading about fictional characters in movies/books, comparing myself to them because they're experiencing things I wish I was doing or felt like I missed out on. I'm in therapy but now I'm even comparing myself to my therapist. I've tried to bring it up to them but it's understandably uncomfortable and I'm not sure they know how to best deal with it.

And in the following lines i am comparing myself to my medical school colleagues as well, so I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs sth related to the demanding medical studies.

Since i was in grade school and i think I wasn‚Äôt developing any healthy social life. I had a cousin who was my same age, same school, same class, and while we could always have fun and sharing studying time, i was totally anything but that. I was always aiming to have grades higher than her, to have better hair, better friends, being more favored by adults..etc. Whatever she excelled at naturally i just didn‚Äôt try like she had a better handwriting and better drawing skills, so i never cared to even try to nurture those skills.
Then around grade 4 i was part of a group(or so thought) and i was always wary of them breaking up with me if my grades dropped. I would look down myself and feel like they are looking down on me if I wasn‚Äôt the top if the school. They all had harmony and would talk about different stuff and all i could do was talking about studying. Whenever we were out for food i would feel left out because no one would talk to me.
Fast forward to high school. I moved to another city for a school that is for high achievers based on their middle school exams and an IQ test. Now the competition in this school was fierce because where i live, your high school grades solely determine which faculty you would be eligible to enroll in. I had to study in a different language now and i saw how everyone was like nails and teeth into that. That made me highly insecure. I was always afraid that people would study more than me. I was always afraid that someone would sleep less than me. I made it as the top student but no scholarship took me in. I saw my colleagues who had less grades and less awards get better educational opportunities thanks to scholarships. I was remorseful and felt like I didn‚Äôt give my parents the best thing. That made me stop trying in college. I was so burnt out of competition and studying and just wanted to quit everything. Whenever i thought lf picking myself up i had that all-or-none thought that if i am not the top student then i am no one, and that the parents of the top students aren‚Äôt better parents than mine. But I didn‚Äôt even try because whenever i sat to study i aways thought of failure and developed anxious thoughts that i could hear my heart beat. Now i hate that part of me, yet whenever I think of just leaving it behind, i always get thoughts of people betraying me and leaving me alone while living their glamorous lives.

This is my (24F) first post on Reddit ever and just randomly found this subreddit and would like you‚Äôre support/opinions..
Basically, long story short, I feel guilty with my adult life and saying no to things my younger/single/live at home/no budget cousins/friends want to do. 

My husband and I work full time, both of us are in school, and I‚Äôm thinking of getting a part time job on the weekend for some extra income. We barely have any savings and are okay with this because we‚Äôre both young/in school and have a lot of family support. 
Before I got married I would go out with friends for dinners and days at the mall spending money because I had no worries about groceries or car insurance lol. Now I actively don‚Äôt make plans with friends because I know going out =spending money. In my head it‚Äôs ‚Äúdo I spend $50 on a dinner with friends or $50 on groceries for my home‚Äù..
Recently I‚Äôve noticed my cousins/friends being frustrated with me not going out or not participating in planning things because I‚Äôm so uninterested. My husband and I do go out occasionally and budget that into our month. The occasional dinner or activity happens 2-3 times a month. I cook all meals at home and try my best to not even get a coffee when I‚Äôm out. 
My cousins are starting to plan a vacation this summer and I straight up said that I have work and am on a budget because I already have 2 trips planned this year (booked last year for cheap lol) and I don‚Äôt want to even spend $300-400 on a weekend away because for me that‚Äôs my gas money and for them that‚Äôs a new pair of shoes.

Has anyone else been in this middle ground? I feel so bad for saying no but I need to be responsible.

592,Choosing a hospital and Primary Care Physician,10kj78g,"Just to give some context about myself so hopefully someone can help my dilemma; I'am a uninsured, jobless, extremely depressed/anxiety filled individual who is also extremely obese with constant Hemorrhoidal pain/GI issues and also lives with his parents who both are overweight in a hoarders house with little to no money to really go around.

I REALLY want to find a regular doctor that can help refer me to a psychiatrist and maybe therapist (as I believe, this is my main issue, but of coarse, not only) but there is one issue; I really DON'T understand anything about these procedures.

I don't know if certain types of Hospital Branches are better than other ones overall (ex.kaiser, Metro, or maybe even Universal Health Services being some. And what I mean by the ""being the better overall""  I mean in terms of Doctors, medical equipment, financial programs, etc) Does any of it matter? Or not?

If certain Primary Health Care Doctors are better than other ones (ex. MD's vs APRN-CNPs). Also, If it does or doesnt matter if they have stuff they are either a major in or just interested in like when it says they deal with ""obesity, diet, bone pain, etc."" for example.

I just dont know what to think or do. I have gone in the past through my states hospital before which was Metro and they set me up with a primary care doctor, a dietician and every now n' then a physician for my hemorrhoids. But for the most part, nothing was helping me from there aside from the visit to the physician to put tubes on on my hemorrhoids when it would become too overwhelming. 

I also ended up accruing over 4,000$ in debt for all these visits but as I was going the whole time I was trying to go under their financial Assistance program in order to get medicaid or medicare (I'am not even sure if they were trying to get me medicare, this is just my understanding and I don't know if any hospital can help with getting medicare). I never got the medicaid or medicare and each time I tried to go through with their Financial Assistance Program it seemed like nothing mattered or helped to help pay for anything.

I stopped going because it seemed like nothing was helping and because of the constant debt I was racking up.

As of 2021, I made and had a telephone appointment with a PCP and told him that my depression pills were not renewed and I explained how I stopped going to appointments because of how large the debt I built was. He renewed the pills and told me that there were financial appointments I could make to resolve that.

I didn't make any appointments. But just 2 weeks ago I received a phone call from metro claiming that the doctor that renewed my pills wanted me to make an appointment with another Primary Care Physician so I could get my pills renewed again. 

I went online and found out that my debt is gone.

2 questions: Did this dr. possibly have anything to do with the debt being taken care of? Because it just seems so random I have had it for 2-3 years and now months after speaking with him it's gone. And why would he want me to go to another dr. when he was my doctor already twice? Why should I have to make an appointment with another doctor when I just want my depression pills auto-renewed? 

I am so stuck on what to believe/think. I wish to do better and have my health improve but I am too terrified to know what I can do with everything I listed above. It's terrifying and cruel to think if I go to someone who I will potentially see for rest of my life that doesn't give a shit truly about me and doesn't specialize that heavily into any of these health issues I deal with.

What I am asking is simply, I am at 31 year old person, who after looking at their life has never really had any direction. Ive always told myself to follow the steps of others around me, which ive tried and failed. These things happening have lead me to a life of self defeating actions and zero growth/ sense of purpose. Now at 31 I live in an aimless mindstate, im always angry, constantly homeless and never really growing. In fact I didn‚Äôt even notice that everything ive done has always been temporary and only for a moment. Some examples include, getting a job, yet never envisioning promotions or savings or networking. Others can be working out for only a month, while still not managing my own health. The biggest one for me has been, engaging in life overall in a temporary manner, infact, I expect to die with zero accomplishments and lots of debt.  Yet the entire time i have been living  with a lie in my mind to do what I can for others. I cannot get any of that time back, I understand that and therefore have given up in well everything. I simply have lost the will to care, yet I always find myself saying, ‚ÄúAs long as im only hurting myself its okay‚Äù. Which when I think about it, its not just true, even if I don‚Äôt see it will all connect in one way or another, when I die, my debt will be passed to the next relative.

I‚Äôm 25 years old and ever since I was about 15 the thought of working for someone else for 40+ years filled me with anxiety. I know a lot of people feel this way. 

Over the years I worked in sales while also starting multiple businesses (most failed) and trading stocks on the side. Over time I became pretty good at trading to the point where I‚Äôm able to make over 100k a year working less than 2 hours a day on average. 

Now this is not a brag. A few years ago I would‚Äôve said this proudly and been bragging but that‚Äôs one thing that changed a lot in my trading and in life. I don‚Äôt get excited when I make money or disappointed when I lose it. 

I tried building a business based around stocks but quickly realized that I never actually liked business I just wanted to avoid working forever.

Well here I am. 25 years old making good money barely working yet I am more unhappy than I have ever been. I spent years putting myself in a position where I would have free time but now that I have time I don‚Äôt know what to do with it.

I go out sometimes with friends and play video games to pass the time but even that is losing its enjoyment. I try to workout (it‚Äôs hard because I‚Äôve been in 2 car accidents and slipped every disc in my back) and play basketball since I grew up playing but that is such a small portion of the day still.

I have dealt with mental health issues all my life. Although a diagnosis has not been decided on, bipolar seems to play a role in it, as well as autism or some other sensory input issue. I'm extremely treatment resistant but still working with a psychiatrist to explore every medication option available to me. (This is not the part I need advice on, just context).

I struggle with things that feel very basic, keeping up with cleaning and cooking, personal habits and hygiene. I'm struggling with what seems like basic life skills. I recognize part of this is the effect of neglect I suffered as a kid/teen, and also depressive symptoms currently, so I'm trying not to beat myself up over it, but I feel very behind. This is my first time living truly alone, so no roommates or parents to help remind me of tasks. I love the new freedom but its also scary how much I feel like I'm floundering. 

Developing a routine is also proving to be very difficult. Its like the anxious part of my brain says to plan everything in great detail, but the depressive part says ""why bother?"".

612,13 tips to help you adult,10joe0d,"Hi guys, 

I have a weekly newsletter on how to adult. Over the last two or so years, I've shared a ton of tips. Here are 12 of them. Let me know if you find this helpful and I can do a part 2 :) 

**Keep a ‚Äúfor later‚Äù list.** You know when you‚Äôre supposed to be doing something (working, studying, etc.), but you suddenly realize you have to Google that really specific thing? Or reply to a friend‚Äôs message? Or buy some more chocolate? One way to deal with internal distractions like these is to keep a ‚Äúfor later‚Äù list. Next time you‚Äôre focusing on a particular task and notice your mind wandering, write down the thought or feeling that occurred to you. It will take the edge off, and you won‚Äôt have to think about it. Then, later, you can review your list and do the things you actually want/need to do. For some people, a ‚Äúfor later‚Äù list can even help them go to sleep at a reasonable hour. Simply make a list of all the things you want to do that are stopping you from going to bed and tell yourself you‚Äôll do them first thing tomorrow‚Äîif you still want to!

**Let yourself be vulnerable.** When we [criticize those we love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiK9SIuB_LU&ab_channel=TheKnowledgeProject), what we‚Äôre really doing is trying to hide our vulnerability, says the psychotherapist Esther Perel. Behind every criticism, there‚Äôs a wish, but it means having to put yourself out there and‚Äîand this is important‚Äîpotentially be refused. Criticism, therefore, acts as a protective mechanism. Instead of saying what you want (for example, to spend more time with your partner), you shift the focus to the other person‚Äîwhat‚Äôs wrong with them, what they didn‚Äôt do or did do that‚Äôs so bad (for example, staying out all night with their friends when you had something else planned). The [solution](https://www.estherperel.com/blog/stop-bickering-its-killing-your-relationship) is simple: say what you want rather than how the other person ‚Äúfailed‚Äù you.

**Start a logbook.** Keeping a diary sounds cool until you realize that a) nothing interesting ever happens to you b) you don't have time to write in that damn thing anyway. Enter [the logbook](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/at-home/newsletter.html), a notebook where you make lists of facts of the things that happened that day. Much more manageable, and you can still keep track of the passing time.

**Take a break to soothe.** When you‚Äôre in the middle of a heated argument, you enter a heightened state of arousal. American psychologist John M. Gottman calls this state ‚Äú[flooding](https://www.gottman.com/blog/manage-conflict-part-4/).‚Äù Your heart speeds up, adrenaline starts to pump, and you enter what's commonly called a ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù mindset. This is not a great recipe for a constructive argument. By the time your heart rate gets to 100 BPM or more, you literally can‚Äôt hear what the other person is saying. Communication breaks down. One way to overcome this is to learn how to soothe. And the best way to do this is to press pause. Both people in an argument should take a break from one another until their heart rate slows down. Take at least 20 minutes. But, don't take too long either. More than 24 hours, and you risk creating avoidance and, ultimately, resentment.

**Learn how to juggle work and life.** The key to juggling competing commitments? According to writer Nora Roberts, it‚Äôs understanding which [balls you currently have in the air](https://twitter.com/jenlynnbarnes/status/1220182162118451200?lang=en) are made of plastic (i.e., they‚Äôll bounce back) and which are made of glass (i.e., if dropped, they‚Äôll shatter). The ‚Äúballs‚Äù we juggle are not defined by their theme, i.e., ‚Äúfamily,‚Äù ‚Äúwork,‚Äù or ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù  Instead, the commitments we have are a lot more specific, i.e., ‚Äúdeadline for project X,‚Äù ‚Äúmeeting Y for lunch,‚Äù or ‚Äúcalling grandma.‚Äù Some of these balls will be glass, and others will be plastic. Dropping any balls, even plastic ones, sucks. But sometimes, it‚Äôs inevitable. As long as the balls are plastic, everything will be okay.

**Treat your career as a portfolio of jobs/roles/opportunities.** Don‚Äôt try to plan your career, advises the American [entrepreneur Marc Andreessen](https://fictivekin.github.io/pmarchive-jekyll//guide_to_career_planning_part1.html). You can‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen in the future. Instead, focus on acquiring skills and going after opportunities. However, Andreessen advises against randomly ping-ponging from one opportunity to another. Every opportunity has a return (i.e., experience, income, etc.) and a risk profile (i.e., what could go wrong, like having to move somewhere you hate). Anytime you are presented with an opportunity, you should analyze the risk-to-reward ratio BUT do so with the potential lifetime portfolio of risks in mind. For example, when you‚Äôre out of school, the jobs you can take will have a different return/risk portfolio than when you‚Äôre married with kids. This approach should help you think more strategically about your career.

**Think of chores as ‚Äúcare tasks.‚Äù** Pretty much everyone can agree that household chores suck. But what if you didn‚Äôt think of them as chores but instead as ‚Äúcare tasks‚Äù? This is what therapist KC Davis proposes that we do in an insightful [Apartment Therapy article](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/healthy-ways-talk-about-cleaning-36959877) on healthy ways to think about cleaning. Instead of looking at household chores as things to cross off a to-do list, treat them as self-care opportunities. ‚ÄúChores are obligations with external standards, but care tasks are acts of kindness that help you care for yourself,‚Äù Davis says, adding that ‚Äúthis simple shift moves the motivation inward and can make completing care tasks easier.‚Äù

**Use reminders to put your life on autopilot.** Keep forgetting your friend‚Äôs birthday? Missed another payment? Didn‚Äôt realize that appointment/meeting was on at 10 AM and not 11 AM? [Set your life on autopilot](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/981ofv/how_im_using_iphone_reminders_to_put_my_entire/) with phone reminders. Anytime there‚Äôs something you need to remember to do, whether in your personal or professional life, put it in your iPhone reminders or Google Calendar/Google Reminders.

* ***For things you have to do regularly***, like taking out the trash or getting med refills, make the reminder recurring.
* ***For joint to-dos***, share the reminder with your partner/friend/parent/etc.
* ***For location-based tasks***, set Google Calendars to send you a notification when you arrive at a specific location. For example, ‚Äúpick up x at Target.‚Äù

**Accept your bad moods.** Next time you‚Äôre in a bad mood, rather than trying to ‚Äú[mood shame](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211214-the-surprising-upsides-of-foul-moods)‚Äù yourself into feeling better, just accept that you‚Äôre feeling lousy. And‚Äîthis is the hard part‚Äîtry to see positive value in whatever negative emotion you‚Äôre experiencing. Research shows that the more people feel like their emotions are ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù or ‚Äúirrational‚Äù (i.e., something they shouldn't be feeling), the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression. What‚Äôs more, people who can see something positive in unpleasant emotions (for example, disappointment = lesson) tend to have better physical and mental health.

**Focus on verbs, not nouns.** Want to avoid getting ‚Äúpigeonholed‚Äù in your career? The key, according to the writer Austin Kleon, is to think in terms of [verbs rather than nouns](https://lithub.com/otherppl-shell-4/), especially when you‚Äôre just starting out. For example, instead of saying you want to be a novelist, focus on becoming someone who writes stories. ‚ÄúIf you just like to write and put stories together, that keeps things open in a way that a certain particular noun doesn‚Äôt. And so you stay open to things,‚Äú says Kleon. ‚ÄúYou might end up a podcaster. You might end up a filmmaker. You might be a teacher.‚Äù 

**Keep a failure resume.** Our resumes are where we put down our accomplishments, but what about all the stuff that didn‚Äôt work out? According to researcher Melanie Stefan, these can go in our ‚Äúfailure resume.‚Äù In 2010, Stefan published [an article on the topic](https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7322-467a), calling researchers to share their failures to help others deal with setbacks. Multiple people took her up on this, including Professor of Economics at Stockholm University (and previously, Assistant Professor at Princeton) [Johannes Haushofer](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/bed2706fd34e29822004dbe29cd00bb5.pdf/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures[1].pdf), whose failure resume [went viral](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/30/cv-of-failures-princeton-professor-publishes-resume-of-his-career-lows). However, beyond just making others feel better, our failure resumes can also teach us valuable lessons, says [Tim Herrera of The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html), and ‚Äúshow that the path to success isn‚Äôt a straight line.‚Äù To make the most of your failure resume:

* Analyze the practical, operational reasons why something did not go to plan.
* Jot down the lesson you learned under each failure. 

**Do the thing to avoid regret.** Although feeling regret is an inevitable part of being human, that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt at least strive to minimize how many regrets we have in our lives. One way to do that is to just do the thing‚Äîeven if it scares you. Research shows that regardless of age or life circumstances, people seem to regret not doing [things](https://theweek.com/articles/445297/how-overcome-regret-according-science) (i.e., inaction) more than doing things (i.e., action). When we do something that doesn‚Äôt work out, we can at least learn from our mistakes and move on. When things are ‚Äúundone,‚Äù we have [unrealized ambitions](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/regret/) and end up feeling ‚Äú[stuck](https://theconversation.com/regret-can-be-all-consuming-a-neurobehavioral-scientist-explains-how-people-can-overcome-it-172466)‚Äù and wondering what could have been.

**Brush your teeth BEFORE breakfast.** Brushing your teeth after breakfast may make more sense in theory, but the reality is that you should be doing it first thing in the morning. When you brush your teeth right after you wake up, you 1) remove the plaque-causing bacteria that builds up on your teeth as you sleep; 2) cover your enamel with a protective barrier against the acids in your food; 3) jumpstart your saliva production that helps break down food and kills bad bacteria in your mouth. If you‚Äôre stuck in your old ways, at least wait 30 minutes after breakfast before you brush your teeth, ESPECIALLY if you eat acidic foods (toast, coffee, citrus, etc.)‚Äîotherwise, you increase your risk of tooth enamel demineralization, which is how tooth decay starts.",Narcisians,3,10,0.92

620,Friendly reminder to all the adults/newly independent people out there; Do NOT go into credit card debt.,10jd3u8,I think a good rule of thumb to live by is to limit the max credit card debt you allow yourself to have to 1 paycheck worth. It‚Äôs so freaking frustrating paying over a grand a month in desperation to get rid of these credit cards and even at that rate it won‚Äôt be gone for more than 2 years. Please don‚Äôt get yourselves into trouble over nothing; every dollar borrowed today will be repaid 3x down the road.

621,How can I be a better husband?,10jbxk8,"I am a newly wed in my mid-thirties and have been with my wife for 7 years. The older I get, the more I realize I have some toxic personality traits I need to change. Just typing that is hard to do because I don't think of myself as a toxic person, but I guess that's classic denial, right? I think of myself as a mostly level-headed person who is loving and supportive but if I stop and really examine who I am, I see that isn't the full picture. I have a problem with my ego. I mistakenly view myself as the ""man of the house"" or ""head of the household"", which I know is wrong, patriarchal and outdated. This is probably because I grew up during a time where this was more common and saw it during my own upbringing. 

I can often be argumentative, confrontational and like to be right all the time. Being in an argument with me can feel like being interrogated because I argue indefatigably. I am quick to anger over trivial issues and just as quick to (mis)place blame. I say condescending and hurtful things which I apologize for later but the apologies ring more hollow as time goes on because my behavior doesn't change. My wife is smart, patient, forgiving and rarely gets angry. She takes good care of herself mentally and physically and has much better control over her emotions than I do. I'm not all bad, but this post isn't for me to defend myself. It is to acknowledge that despite the things I do right, I am doing many other things wrong, and they are unfair to the person I love the most. So I'm asking for your insight. Have you or a significant other overcome this kind of behavior? How? Transcendental meditation? Therapy? Medication? Exercise? A self-help book? I am open to all suggestions and perspectives. I know there aren't any quick fixes or shortcuts here.",ThrowRA0182716555219,96,199,0.94

Unfortunately, next day after the first trial day I had a tooth removal and could not come. I did inform the boss that I couldn't come the next day, but could day after the removal. He said it's fine and that they will call with the final answer. They never did. And I waited for literally 2 months.

635,"Workers comp statement, who is the audience which reads it? What details do i share?",10ixqgi,"I‚Äôm injured because basically in the last month, the company was growing and was adding another client so my out of state boss hired someone I trained this new person, this person began calling out sick after he was out on his own and we already had the extra work so I was doing the work of 2x routes. This person is also way too slow for how much time he‚Äôs had to learn and my boss still won‚Äôt fire him, when replacing him could just take 2-3 days max with a capable hire.
While my job isn‚Äôt so physical demanding for a driver job, by any other standard it still is. Saturday I told my direct supervisor that my right rotator cuff was hurting so bad I‚Äôll have to get it checked out, and said it‚Äôs work caused and he said ok, and he‚Äôs actually suggested that it should be workers compensation, though I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get a sick/injury paycheck but they will cover the costs for X-ray and urgent care visits yesterday

Essentially all the stress both this physical inflammation and mental stress is from from his lack of action on the new hire but he probably can‚Äôt believe it cause im 20 yrs younger than him, though he‚Äôs taller and still athletic himself- picture Liam Neeson
 
And also, I‚Äôm only 8 months into this job and learned too late that in the winter months one of my tasks can be skipped and this was his responsibility to inform me and this is more or less why I‚Äôm injured. He‚Äôs informed me but he‚Äôs given opposite instructions on different days depending on the weather- not what I just learned- which is cut down 90% (regardless of weather) that which is a repetitive process that caused my shoulder to hurt. Sure I was able to do it all summer but I‚Äôm not a machine and also the colder temps I think played a part in my ligament/arthritis injury. 

When I can say there were two times in the past week when I had to fix a minor equipment issue and that meant lots of climbing which could have also acted in hurting my shoulder. 

Long story short I‚Äôm told that employers have to be very acceptant of their workers that were injured on the job and cannot be fired so I‚Äôm wondering how harshly I can paint the blame on my supervisor in this statement. All this seems a bit age biased against me considering the new guy is around his age and hasnt yet proven himself but is getting a so much patience from him but on my end, with the equipment issue, I have very pushy texts like ‚Äúcan you fix it today?‚Äù at the end of a 13 hr shift.

P.s. sure it‚Äôs not a life de-habilitating injury but essentially I‚Äôve felt I‚Äôve been treated unfairly since way back when I was asked to train someone and I still haven‚Äôt seen extra dispensation for it.  Even after all the extra work I‚Äôve done while the other guy called out ‚Äúsick‚Äù in his first month. It's not that I want to get my supervisor fired either, but maybe just someone in the company to a notice of what's gone on recently.

638,Failing Mid Thirties,10irvhw,"Alright. Hello, peeps. 

I‚Äôm about to turn 34 and I just hate myself. Most of myself. Like, I cannot stand myself. 

I think I‚Äôm funny and mindful and honest, which are traits I admire in others and am happy that I have/implement them. I also think I‚Äôm decently smart. I like to research a lot. Lit major ova here. I know a lot about a lot of subjects because it‚Äôs just how I roll. I can have a conversation with just about anyone about anything‚Ä¶but I also suck and no one seems to like me. Some people sometimes. 

I‚Äôve recently gone through a lot of bad years and, with the grace of whatever higher power, came out on the other side of it. I really thought I was going to end up dead or homeless. And I was homeless for a bit, but I still had a safe place to rest my head every night. I got really sick at 26 and my entire life fell down. Wasn‚Äôt diagnosed (autoimmune) until 31, and have been rebuilding since then. Trying to. 

Got covid and almost died. It threw me into early female pattern hair loss so I am 33, using Rogaine, single, no kids, and work in a call center from home. I also have 100+ pounds to lose. I have no friends from when I was sick. Family relationships aren‚Äôt there anymore. I was treated really badly and pulled away from a lot of people. 

I really thought that by this age, I would be married or almost married. On the way to having kids or at least have one. And almost be a millionaire.  I was working in my dream industry before I got sick and now there‚Äôs really no hope for getting back into it. I‚Äôm the lowest rung in a call center. I make $33k a year. Live with my financially unstable parent so we can both survive. I‚Äôm my nightmare version of myself at this age. Everything I was working to avoid. 

I‚Äôm in therapy. Session tomorrow. Woo hoo. But how do I fix all of this? It‚Äôs SO MUCH to fix. I‚Äôve come to realize I‚Äôm obnoxious and it‚Äôs rooted in extreme insecurity. I hate myself a lot of times. 

I want to stop being insecure. Anxious. Depressed. I want friends and a social life again (how do I do that now???). Just last night I paid for ethical porn and thought I was literally scammed and was freaking out. I was laughing so hard and had no one to share it with. Perfect 12am text to a bestie. My former bestie was on my mind. I would have totally texted her and she‚Äôd have been laughing with me. I cut her off because she was ghosting me while I was sick. Everything bad happened while I was sick. I want to date and be married eventually. I want to lose my weight.

639,"Everytime I try to advance my career, I get a stomach ache...help?",10iqf23," 

I am stuck and need to know how to stop holding myself back?

I'm in my mid-twenties now and pursuing a post-graduate degree in a very specific field of study. I attend the top university in my country and am halfway through my masters degree. I love what I study and enjoy reading up on my specific area of focus in my free time. However, at the end of 2021 I had expressed to my parents in passing that my univeristy is not very supportive of my niche area of study. They sat me down later and said they seriously think I should look into opportunities at universities overseas that would better support my field. I looked into it and found some absolutely perfect programmes that I would really enjoy. (To give you an indication of how perfect; one programme I would be working directly with an academic whose work is the basis of mine.)

The problem is everytime I sit down to apply for these programmes, I feel the need to vomit. I have a huge knot in my stomach and my heart races and burns (slightly). In 2022, I got as far as asking for references before I decided not to apply that year. And that was very close to the dead-line as I kept putting it off. I work a part-time job with kids that doesn't pay well. My excuse for putting the appliations off a year was that I needed to stay at the part time job a little longer as there was important projects for some of the kids futures. That seemed to stop the stomach-aches for a while.

Now it's 2023 and I need to start applications again, but everytime I try my stomach aches. I am worried I am going to procrastinate this again until it is too late. I've tried to abandon the idea entirely but then I get stomach aches over not going. I get stomach aches over having to stay here in my unsupportive department, or get a full time job. I've always known exactly what I want and have gone for it (I'm very type-A) and have never experienced these stomach aches over life decisions (or just moving forward in life) before. I seem to want to abandon everything I have worked for and stay in my part-time job, but I also feel very ashamed and anxious about having not achieved as much as my peers of the same age.

The thing that might be holding me back is; (1) that I don't want to move to another country, I like my country and the work opportunities here. But my logical self knows I can just complete my studies overseas and move back. (2) I don't want to leave my part-time job. I really love it, but it doesn't pay well and has no opportunities for full time. I wish I could do it for a few more years, as I don't think my time with the team is finished, but I will be finished with my masters soon and need to then either continue studying in my home-country university or get a full time job elsewhere. Both of these options ALSO give me stomach-aches. (3) Moving overseas is scary (even for a brief time)! I can barely drive around without google maps here, now I must start over alone? But again, logically I know I will be fine.

What is the solution to this stomach-ache? How do I get over this year get these applications done soon? This is a both a concern of life-choices and how to be productive (and finish the applications) with anxiety. (As I know I can always reject offers later)
