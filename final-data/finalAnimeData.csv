1,Seeking Feedback for /r/anime's New User Experience,11v7wbv,"Hello everyone!

We're back with another feedback thread. Some of you may have noticed the announcements and discussion in Monthly Meta in [February](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/10tvdq3/meta_thread_month_of_february_05_2023/) or [March](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11ihlcb/meta_thread_month_of_march_05_2023/), and others may have encountered it directly, but we implemented a trial for a pretty major change to our New User experience on the subreddit.

Previously, Reddit's auto-mod tools gave us access to a couple particular data points regarding a user's account: The account's age, and the account's *site-wide* Reddit karma. We had combined these two features to prevent posting by accounts less than 7 days old or with notable net-negative karma. Users failing the 7-day check would receive an auto-mod message telling them to ask us for approval via modmail.

We implemented this check for a variety of reasons, all of which boil down to protecting the community and keeping content relevant. It cuts down on the amount of spam, toxicity, and off-topic posting, since bad-faith accounts tend to be rather fresh, and impulsive trolls can't just whip up a new account and immediately start shitposting here. The filter also had a nice side-effect in that it's fairly common for brand-new Redditors to be highly unlikely to read our (admittedly extensive) community rules. Many times, a post caught in our newbie filter is one we wouldn't have allowed, anyway.

A few months back, Reddit implemented a new auto-mod tool for us to experiment with. Now, auto-mod can check a user's post and/or comment karma *specifically on the subreddit in question.* With this new tool, we began a trial in which we retired our old 7-day lockout, and instead replaced it with a new check: A user has to have a meager 10 comment karma *on* /r/anime before they are able to make a post.

This trial began early this month and the results thus far have been... significant. There's been a rather dramatic decrease in the amount of new posts making it onto the subreddit, and a very large number of posts are getting filtered out, because it turns out that a lot of people trying to make posts to the community haven't participated in the community before.

[Artist rendering of people blocked by the filter.](https://preview.redd.it/lx6z2lexnloa1.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=05141a72425f268e80fa0d765f4b3720022ab613)

It's a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the vast majority of the content getting caught in the filter are posts that would have been removed anyway. Many would get hit by other auto-mod rules. Title or post body too short, direct image posts for flairs that don't accept images, TikTok links, outright naming piracy sites, mentioning onlyfans. Y'know, normal everyday stuff.

Then there's a significant chunk of posts that would have made it through auto-mod only to ultimately get manually removed for breaking many of our other content relevance and quality rules. Improper clips, short edits, off-topic discussion, piracy watermarks in footage, simple questions we'd hit with immediate canned removals, *someone asking for people to add details to a fake anime IMDB page that they made up in order to gaslight their friends into believing a nonexistent anime is real*, etc.

On the other hand, the filter was also catching more than a few legitimate posts in the \[Discussion\], \[Help\], and \[What to Watch?\] flairs. Proportionally, the amount of ""otherwise valid"" posts caught was completely and utterly dwarfed by the amount of ""invalid, even discounting the karma filter"" posts. But there's always the risk of over-moderating, and the filter is indeed useful, but it might be casting too wide a net.

# By the Numbers:

[Here are our spreadsheets, numbers below pulled from this.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15i6fEFyorsM3tlzhEG_-_BXFSyBYhAWUoQuF3upbj4Q/edit#gid=0) (Because Durinthal likes stats.)

In the first two weeks of the trial there were 4685 total posts made and 3836 of those (82%) ended up being removed. Of those 3657 (78% of total) were removed by AutoModerator rules, and of the automod removals 3329 (91% removals, 71% of all posts) were specifically due to the low subreddit comment karma rule. It's also estimated that 1765 of the low karma removals (53%) would have been removed by other automod rules if this rule had not been in place.

That leaves 1564 low karma removals (47%, 33% of all posts) that were posts that would need manual review. And so we reviewed all of them, at least giving them a quick look. From here on out the exact numbers might not line up because we changed our methodology for the second week (first week was all manual tallying, second with automated assistance), but the totals are close so only a minor variance.

Of the 1564 posts that wouldn't be removed by automod without this rule, about 142 (9%) were deleted before we got to them to check. Of the remainder we determined that nearly half (695) of the posts should have been removed by a human mod, averaging about 50 posts per day. 580 (37%, 12% of all posts) of the posts would be technically allowed by the rules, though many of those (\~20%) we considered to be of poor quality at a glance. The other 147 posts (9%) fell into a couple of categories: repeats where the user made the same post again, and an ""undecided"" group where it wasn't immediately clear if they'd be allowed or not.

Overall there were 849 posts *not* removed (18%), combined with the posts that *would have* been allowed that totals 1429, so that's a drop of about 40% of the posts on /new (excluding removals) with this rule.

# So, on to the current matter, and the thing we'd like your opinion on:

We currently have a vote running to make the comment karma filter a permanent replacement for the old 7-day filter. We *additionally* have votes running to *exempt* \[Help\] and/or \[What to Watch?\] posts from the filter, meaning those two flairs could be posted normally, by anyone, without interference.

Is this a great idea? Has the subreddit felt ""cleaner"" and absent ""low-effort"" and self-promo spam over the last two weeks?

Is this a terrible idea? Has the subreddit felt ""dead"" with fewer posts getting through, even if *some of* those posts aren't great?

Where do you think the ""barrier for entry"" should be on the community? Keep in mind that *no* barrier means you'll be seeing a lot more porn, crypto, and other completely off-topic spam until a moderator can manually deal with that sort of content. There have to be *some* ground rules or else this place will get real messy, real fast[.](https://i.imgur.com/0kSXhfi.png)

10,"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [March 19th, 2023]",11vu718,"Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2023 season (like **Kubo-san won't let me be Invisible!** or **Spy Classroom**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Mairimashita! Iruma-kun Season 3**).

With regards to Fall 2022 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **Bocchi the Rock!** or **Mob Psycho 100 III**) if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

        [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

comes out to be [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

**QUESTIONS FOR YOU - WEEK 10:**

>I didn’t give you a questions for week 10, only gave you an advice to skip ED7 until episode 80.

For those who did so, my question is ***""Did you guessed that Kyubei is a woman, before it was blatantly given?""***

When i was first time watching Yagyu arc i figured that one only due to ED7 Signal.

Also to not leave rewatchers behind i have an another question for them.

***""Was this arc better on rewatch for you, or no?""***

For me, i found this arc more weaker comparing to impact of this arc when i was watching it for first time. Also the whole toilet episode was more funnier when i was watching it for first time. But last two episodes of this arc saved it.

**Regarding spoilers:**

Rewatchers please dont talk without using spoiler tags \[Spoilers\] >!like this!< about events which still didn't happen in anime, don't name characters that weren't introduced yet, don't post pictures of characters yet to be introduced and try to refrain from using arcs and episodes names yet to be introduced.

*DON'T EVEN TRY TO BE VAGUE THINKING YOU ARE SO CLEVER AND NO ONE WILL CONNECT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER LIKE SAYING IT WOULD BE SHAME IF YOUR LOCAL POST OFFICE SENT YOU A BOMBASTIC LIST. JUST. USE. SPOILERS TAGS. LIKE THIS* \[Spoilers\] >!https://i.imgur.com/nojEEcg.png!<

There will be first watchers discussing it together with us and I believe nobody here wants them to be spoiled.

If you want to talk about something you noticed on your rewatch, which is hinting about future events hid it properly underneath the spoilers like the fact \[Spoilers\] >!that the information hidden in this spoiler is totally pointless.!<

**FINAL WORDS + LITTLE TEASER:**

Last two weeks brought us action, emotions and humor in a form of Fuyo arc and Yagyu arc. But before them, we had a week with every episode containing it’s own little story centered around characters as Yamazaki, Zenzo and Katsura.

Those who loved episodes likes this will be next week treated as **ROYALTY.**",Shocketheth,57,14,0.9

23,The Epic Adventure of Heroic Age: A Must-Watch for Sci-Fi Fans,11vjirv," 

Heroic Age is a science fiction anime series that explores themes of destiny, war, and the search for meaning in life. What sets it apart from other anime series is its epic scale and intricate world-building. The story takes place in a vast, galaxy-spanning civilization where different tribes and factions are vying for power and dominance.

https://preview.redd.it/1zycjj84rooa1.jpg?width=1311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ba379c15239f1d3d6fb611d9f7406ab98d46fdb

The series also features a diverse cast of characters, each with their own motivations and conflicts, as well as spectacular battle scenes that showcase the animation studio's attention to detail and creativity.

One of the most unique aspects of Heroic Age is its depiction of the ""Tribe,"" a race of beings with god-like powers who are responsible for the creation and maintenance of the galaxy. As the series unfolds, the true nature and purpose of the Tribe is gradually revealed, adding layers of complexity and intrigue to the story.

Overall, Heroic Age is a thrilling and thought-provoking anime that offers a unique take on science fiction and epic storytelling.",Katzblazer,2,14,0.85

28,Samurai champloo is really good,11uvy7y,"I just finished samurai champloo and man was it great.

The hip-hop esthetic, the sword fights, that old but still amazing animation are just a few things that this anime a masterpiece 

I really love the multipart episodes that let the main grow a bit as a person.

Those episodes where a foreign language is spoken were also great. Primarily the Dutch episode was really great.

The final 3 parter was a great finisher for the series, also is the final villain voiced by DIO’s voice actor? It sounded familiar.

Overall the series great, would recommend 10/10",Geronimo-07,44,139,0.93

33,ONIMAI Episode 11 - Japanese Trivia and Nuances Lost in Translation,11v5qx2,"*For those that missed my previous posts, this is a post where I talk about some trivia on Japanese culture and some nuances that were lost in the translation from the Japanese audio to the English subtitles of the  newest episode of Onii-chan ha Oshimai! (ONIMAI:I'm Now Your Sister!). I'm using the subs from CrunchyRoll since it's probably the ones that most people watches the show with.*

*Disclaimer: This is only meant to be as interesting things that I wanted to share, and not as saying that the official translation was bad or wrong. Translations between two languages are often interpretations and translators tries to make a compelling story for their target audience. Also, I'm not a native speaker of either English or Japanese, so don't take anything I say as gospel.*

# Episode 11 ([Video format](https://youtu.be/1tY5ElYnOEo))

## Nemu-chan [0m31]

In this episode, we finally got the name of the blue hair girl that we saw a couple of time in previous episodes and was always sleeping: Nemu. It's a really fitting name because in Japanese, 眠い(nemui) means to be sleepy.

## Sagittarius [0m35]

A bit random, but the Japanese word for the astrological sign Sagittarius is 射手座(iteza), written with ""Shoot""(射), ""Hand""(手) and a Kanji that is usually for ""sitting""(座) but in this context it comes from 星座(seiza), the word for constellation and have a meaning of ""gathering""(集まる) or ""collecting"" like a collection of stars(星).

Source: [https://note.com/trapezium\_orion/n/nb5e6c3d0fb52](https://note.com/trapezium_orion/n/nb5e6c3d0fb52)

## Got you pegged [3m43]

When Mahiro reads the horoscope of Mihari that says that she should avoid being argumentative, he then said ドンピシャリ(donpishari), which was translated into ""It's got you pegged"".

The usual meaning of that Japanese expression is to talk about something that ""fits perfectly"" with the current situation.

The origin of it is not clear and have a couple different theories. One of them is that the ドン(don) comes from when a ど(do) is used before something to reinforce it, like in ど真ん中(doman'naka): ""*right* in the center"". And ピシャリ(pishari) would come from ぴったり(pittari): ""perfectly"".

Another theory is that they are onomatopoeia with ドン(don) being the sound of a cannon being fired, and ピシャ(pisha), the sound of a target being hit right in the middle.

Source: [https://gogen-yurai.jp/donpisya/](https://gogen-yurai.jp/donpisya/)

## Not to blow my own trumpet [6m04]

In the scene with the animal horoscopes, when Mahiro gets ask about his animal, before the ""big"" reveal, he used a Yojijukugo(四字熟語), a 4 character compound expression: 手前味噌(temaemiso), translated into ""not to blow my own trumpet"".

手前(temae) usually mean ""in front of you"", ""at hand distance"", but in this expression it as a meaning more toward something homemade, made with your own hands.

And the second part of the expression is the word 味噌(Miso), the same thing as when talking about a Miso soup(味噌汁). Miso is a fermented condiment usually made from soybeans but can vary a lot.

In the past it was something often made differently in each household, and it was a source of pride to have developed a good miso recipe that you could show off to others.

Over time, it became an expression more general to talk about praising yourself

Source: [https://gogen-yurai.jp/temaemiso/](https://gogen-yurai.jp/temaemiso/)

## We're under attack [10m00]

Mahiro used a particular term to describe Momiji and the others barging in for his birthday: カチコミ(kachikomi).

It's a slang term similar in meaning to 殴り込み(naguri komi) to talk about launching an assault or a raid on a location. But this one comes from the very particular vocabulary used by the Yakuza.

The exact origin of the term is uncertain, but it's thought to have originally been used to talk about the action of ""breaking glass""(ガラスを割る), which was often associated with the start of a fight when a group would go attack another one.

Source: [https://www.tutitatu.com/「カチコミ」の使い方や意味、例文や類義語を徹/](https://www.tutitatu.com/「カチコミ」の使い方や意味、例文や類義語を徹/)

## Karma [12m52]

Another Yojijukugo was used in this episode after Mahiro abused a bit too much his Anything-you-want ticket, but this time by Mihari: 因果応報(inga ouhou).

It's an expression that comes from Buddhism to talk about the, most likely familiar, concept of karma.

The first 2 Kanji comes from 原因(gen'in): ""Causes"" and 効果(kouka): ""Results"", or ""Consequences"" if we want to have something that fits the English expression. It's to express that your actions in this life will have consequences in your next one.

The next part is from 応じて(oujite): ""in proportion to"" and 報い(mukui): ""punishment"" or ""recompense"" toward something that you did. To say that your actions will have a punishment or recompense in proportion of its severity

Source: [https://study-z.net/100013983](https://study-z.net/100013983)

## Did you really have to contradict me? [16m17]

When Miyo says that kids their age like to dress up a little and Asahi directly says that she doesn't care about that stuff, the way that Miyo reacted was with the expression 話の腰を折る(hanashi no koshi wo oru), which was translated to ""Did you really have to contradict me?"".

The figurative sense of the Japanese expression is ""to interrupt someone"", ""to butt in"".

The literal sense of it is to ""break""/""fracture""(折る) the ""hip""(腰) of the ""conversation""(話). The hip is seen to be an important part of the body, responsible for a lot of the movement of twisting and bending the body. So breaking it, the important part of the conversation, would make it useless.

## White Day [16m57]

For those that weren't aware, in Japanese culture, the event of Valentine's Day is actually split into two days, on February 14th, it's the day for girls to give chocolates to boys, and one month later, on March 14th, called White Day, boys would give back chocolates to girls.

There's also a common saying that boys need to give back triple the value of what they received (3倍返し). Which is what the guys were talking about, later in the episode \[19m30\], when they said that the ""fancy chocolate didn't cut it"".

## End Card

This week's artist that drew the End Card is [Namori](https://anilist.co/staff/101553/Namori), the mangaka who writes and draw the manga [Yuru Yuri](https://anilist.co/manga/41593/).

36,A look at Yuka in Blue Period,11vvzfd,"This is a video I made about Yuka, a non-gender-conforming character I really like, and what meaning can be taken from their existence.",shaggyjebus,0,1,0.67
37,[FMAB] Thе problem of the scene of Miles and Ed's first conversation about the guilt of the Amestrians before the Ishvalans in FMA:Brotherhood and how a similar dialogue was resolved in FMA 2003,11vu7cz,"I'm talking about the moment in the story when Ed and Al first meet one of the soldiers of the northern mountain fortress Briggs, who turns out to be Ishvalan.

I want to make a reservation right away that in general this is a scene, ok. It is controversial, but Arakawa keeps trying to bring the discussion to the positive side. Ed really says that it is difficult to establish a connection with ishvalans in general because of their closeness, but he believes that trusting relationships can be established between individuals.

I am concerned about the end of the passage of the dialogue that I will now give.

>**Ed:** *Red eyes! You're Ishvalan... But how!? I heard all the Ishvalan soldiers were rounded up before extermination campaign!*

>**Miles:** *Simple I'm not from Ishvala. I do have  Ishvalan blood in me, but my grandmother, my father, even my mother are of different ethnicity. My grandfather's blood runs thickest in my veins, I suppose. That's why I have this skin and eye color...** [Miles looks pointedly at Ed] **Your caused much destruction in the land of my ancestors... Amestrian.*

>**Ed:** *You Ishvalans set fire to my hometown, and killed the parents of my childhood friend.*

It's not even that the size of the damage is not comparable, because we can say that from the point of view of the experience, the feelings of Miles and Ed are comparable, because we can't measure it. The context is the problem. You cannot tell the defending side that you, being the aggressor, have also suffered damage, so you are morally equal.

Here, so that there are no disputes, I will clarify. The scene is really structured in such a way as to show that Ed can really withstand a moral challenge against Miles and that they are equally right and the only way to break the chain of hatred is to forget the grievances. I understand that this is a noble artistic task on the part of Hiromu Arakawa, but to achieve it through this particular conflict and specifically through this scene was a fatal mistake.

Ed could just keep silent or think out loud about what it's like to work in the army who committed genocide, but he literally uses whataboutism. What if it was another Ishvalan, who, unlike Miles, is not inclined to a conciliatory tone? Would the dispute escalate even more?

Against this background, it is interesting how FMA 03 (Fullmetal Alchemist 2003) handles this topic. I will give an excerpt from the dialogue between Ed, Al and two Ishvalan children (Rick and Leo), thematically related to the dialogue from FMAB.

>**Rick:** *Where are you two going?*

>**Al:** *We're going to go after Scar.*

>**Ed:** *If we don't, something terrible is going to happen.*

>**Rick:** *Will you kill him?*

>**Ed:** *Why should I?*

>**Leo:** *Because he's an outcast! He's defiled! That's why!*

>**Ed:** *We want to stop him. After all we alchemists, just like he is. No we're human. We want kill anyone.*

>**Leo:** *You lying! You hate Ishvalans!*

>**Ed:** [reveals his automail arm] *Are you scared?*

>**Leo:** *Not, even a little.*

>**Ed:** *Well... I'm little bit afraid of your red eyes. The first time I saw Scar on those library steps I was scared of him, the first Ishbalan I'd ever seen. But still... There times when our feelings are wrong. What your mother and father told you isn't necessarily completely true... That's why we all have to find our own answers for ourselves.**

>**Al:** *One step at time.*

Here's how the script writer of FMA 03, Sho Aikawa himself comments on this scene (source https://twitter.com/Hagaren2003). I think in this case the author's words have more value than mine.

>At the end of this episode, we see Leo and Rick can’t let go of their feelings of discrimination towards the Ishvalan exile. For example, they believe Ed and Al are cursed even after learning of Al’s true nature. At first I planned to have the brothers point a gun at the Elrics, and upon pulling the trigger, the bullet would ricochet off Al’s armor and hit Rick, the younger brother. This would cause Ed and Al to weep at their helplessness…but, as I thought about it I realized this could’ve made the story too nihilistic. So instead, I wanted to convey the roots of the issue through Ed’s words alone.

>I feel as though some might say Ed is “putting himself on a pedestal” through his “lecture” in that scene. But if you really listen to Park-san’s performance, you’ll understand there’s more as Ed is reminded of his own differences. He realized such feelings of discrimination are also inside him, through Leo and Rick’s hatred of Scar for being an exile. This is why Ed couldn’t tell them to “not discriminate” but rather “find the answer for ourselves” as he was also speaking to himself. I saw some reactions to this episode where someone said, “This doesn’t really affect me since I don’t feel any discrimination.” I truly feel envious of those who can say that.

I have a feeling that Aikawa seems to be trying to fix mistakes in advance, which will later be implemented in chapter 65 of the manga. This is exactly the intonation that, in my opinion, manga and FMAB lack. Ed here really admits that he is a victim of prejudice and does not condemn the brothers for the same. He doesn't try to argue with them or teach them. He describes his own experience and points out that he has irrational xenophobia towards the Ishvalans, but still tries to fight it. And offers Rick and Leo to find the answers to these questions themselves.

In general, I just want to say that although Hiromu Arakawa had a rather noble goal through this scene to show that even different people can find a connection, but it was done too carelessly.",Dioduo,2,1,0.67

***I'm gonna live. Live my life to the end. I wanna be absolutely alive! Absolutely!***

**Questions of the Day, courtesy of u/chilidirigible:**

1) Given that this was a sequel movie with regard to the plot, were you surprised by how many TV series moments it brought back? (And changed, or dare I say ""fixed"".)

2) Context is obviously important, but have you preferred endings that have death as a consequence of events versus endings that pull off a last-second save simply to keep your preferred characters around?

Then, in 2022, a fair amount of the community began holding them in high regard because of [Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru](https://myanimelist.net/anime/48736/Sono_Bisque_Doll_wa_Koi_wo_Suru), [Spy x Family](https://myanimelist.net/anime/50265/Spy_x_Family), and [Bocchi the Rock](https://myanimelist.net/anime/47917/Bocchi_the_Rock).

Any detail you wish to share that's not within the current / past episodes have to be [spoiler tagged](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/q28ulr/announcing_changes_to_spoiler_tags/) which includes details from the manga. Do include the context of the spoilers within the parenthesis:

50,ain't getting romance anime like we used to,11vob1f,"*Tsuki Ga Kirei, Tada Never Falls In Love, Your Lie In April, Tatami Galaxy, Clannad, Golden Time, Relife, Orange, Kokoro Connect, Welcome To NHK, Ore Monogatari, Nagi No Asukara, Kids On The Slope, Kimi Ni Todoke, Josee And The Tiger, Anthem Of The Heart, Just Because, Ancient Magus Bride* & many more like these. 

But for over 2 years now we're getting romcoms after romcoms. I'm not against romcom. I also like it. There was a time when we used to get mix of everything - from drama to romcom, from serious josei to cliched shoujo. But nowadays it's majority of romcoms, rather it's only romcom nowadays. And those romcoms aren't even like Oregairu, Saekano. Those are either one of those teasing trope types or cringe plots (yk what I meant). I'm not saying that all of them are bad, most of them are enjoyable but it's repetitive at this point. I really miss those good ol'days.",Fantastic_Mood_4652,16,0,0.33

Here, you can rank and comment on all of the currently airing anime you’re watching each week basis, as well as discuss your opinions with the rest of /r/anime.

You can format your rankings however you want, from simple lists to making a cool graphic. We even had someone use Excel! The most common way to do things is using a reddit table though.

52,Rewatch Discussion - Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,11umnr8,"When I first read the title of this anime, I thought “Yeah, I’m not gonna watch that.” A few months later, I decided to give it a shot and was blown away by how good the story is. I can’t decide if the series and movie are happy or sad though. At the end of the movie, everyone is still alive and meet each other again in the present. That should be a happy ending, right? Yet the process of getting there was so dramatic that I still feel kind of sad about the way we got there. How did you all feel after watching this anime and movie? I know that the light novels are still being produced and there’s now more source material to make another season or movie with, will there be more Rascal anime? Also, are the light novels worth reading? I’ve never read a light novel that inspired an anime but this show makes me want to check it out.

**Fae Facts:**

Shapeshifting is an absolutely ancient concept, dating back at least as far as the oldest literature.

One interesting sub-type that might be relevant here is the animal as a bride or groom -  These tales have often been interpreted as symbolically representing  arranged marriages; the bride's revulsion to marrying a stranger being  symbolized by his bestial form. The hero(ine) must fall in love with the transformed groom. The  hero or heroine must marry, as promised, and the monstrous form is  removed by the wedding.

**Incantations:**

You are a good lock, an old lock.

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

Last comment of the day goes to /u/Lemurians

> That functioned well as a last episode. It's pretty fitting that a Wandering Witch's greatest wish would be see all the potential paths she could have taken, and didn't.

> The different variations on Elaina were all fun, though I don't think all were appropriately labelled. The ""loves money me"" was redundant with ""greedy me"", and the former would've been more accurately labelled something like Genki Elaina anyway. I thought Elaina's VA did an excellent job changing up her voice to imbue them with all their different personalities and make them feel distinct (for the most part).

> Our Elaina being labelled ""Protagonist Elaina"" because she's the one ""without personality"" was pretty meta in a way that made me chuckle.

You might have noticed I stopped replying as much near the end when my laptop started freezing up and dying on me, but I did read every comment at least once. At least the ones attached to the main post. Over the course of the rewatch I noticed three particular commenters that stood out slightly more than the others and really went above and beyond.

/u/Esovan13 with their constant trivia and knowledge from the light novels while occasionally mentioning the efforts of the voice actors and roles they have played.

𝓢𝓮𝔁𝔂 𝓦𝓲𝓽𝓬𝓱 /u/Elimin8r with their comparisons of magic and characters from Elaina to other fantasy literature. Also they were shilling Jack Vance really hard.

66,In dire need of help to find anime opening song!,11uyqzw,"SO, yesterday my pc crashed while I was listening to my playlist. It crashed just on a specific moment of a specific song. 



The lyrics that stuck on my mind were an ending note ""mugaki kagayaku""or""mugen ni kagayaku"", it was something ""mugXX kagayaku"". I know for sure its on my playlist but for the life of me I CANNOT FIND IT. I must find it, I need help, and for my sanity I have come here for help to see if anyone knows it.



Here are some important clues about the song:


* lyrics - ""mugaki kagayakuuu"" or ""mugen ni kagayaku"" or similar

* singer was male

* I would say the style is close to BHA long hope philia mixed with Naruto Haruka kanata

* I feel like it was an OP rather than an ED

and for the most crucial piece, it exists 100% in this playlist : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ne4kvjpvQDX7IgsTbtCE_9D9yTSLmX4d89XBmh0kFPU/edit?usp=sharing




I would post a .rar with the mp3s but thats probably against the rules.

67,[WT!] Liked Everything Everywhere all at Once? Watch Mawaru Penguindrum,11u6v3o,"I haven't seen posts like this before on the sub but I recently watched Everything Everywhere all at Once (EEAAO) after its success at the Oscars and really enjoyed it, especially since I thought it was so similar to Penguindrum, one of my favorite animes. If you liked EEAAO and haven't seen Penguindrum, I highly recommend you check it out.

If you watched both, I'd also love to hear if you also found the two similar. I'll have a section below sharing the similarities I found.

**What is Mawaru Penguindrum?**

Penguindrum is the story of the 3 siblings of the Takakura family: twin brothers Shouma and Kanba and their terminally ill little sister Himari. Although their parents are nowhere to be found, they live alone happily. However, that all ends when Himari collapses on a trip to the Ikebukuro aquarium and is pronounced dead on arrival to the hospital. Still grieving over her death, Himari is suddenly revived after a mysterious entity within a souvenir penguin hat from the aquarium possesses her in bombastic magical-girl-transformation fashion. With this, Kanba and Shouma are suddenly whisked away from their normal life into a wild goose chase for something called the ""penguindrum,"" with not even the mysterious entity giving them any clues as to what it could be. Penguindrum follows the the siblings in their search to find the penguindrum and change Himari's fated death, all the while more and more secrets about their family come to light.

**Appeal?**

If EEAAO is a story of a Asian-American family struggling with a cultural generation gap told through the lens of a fight to save the multiverse, Mawaru Penguindrum is the story of a family struggling with grief told as a (dark?) magical girl show. They both have a very special way of portraying something very relatable and real in the most absurd, near suspension-of-disbelief-breaking circumstances.

Penguindrum has a reputation for being very confusing, and that is true. I certainly read a few analyses and re-watched the show before feeling confident enough to say I understand it. However, I will also say that some level of confusion is par for the course, and more importantly that not everything needs to be understood to enjoy the show.

[Look how vibrant and lively their house even from just 1 image -ep 1](https://preview.redd.it/2n8fytv8qdoa1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d38b1765e31d40d5bae9cea731063283562fba8)

The show is still visually stunning; with [top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFNxfawS1jw&list=PLVf5K1ZCHE_9lKMP6VFS_zcQjsXqxSCXa&index=42) [tier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjecg5hOIgw&list=PLVf5K1ZCHE_9lKMP6VFS_zcQjsXqxSCXa&index=9) [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NHoUX0wxb8&list=PLVf5K1ZCHE_9lKMP6VFS_zcQjsXqxSCXa) and of course the adorable [penguin mascots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1OnjXW7W3U).

I think that if you keep in mind that, ultimately, Penguindrum is a story about the Takakura's as a family and their love for one another, you will get a lot out of the show even if you don't understand everything. Just like you don't need to know all the events that lead up to the snapshots we see of the many verses Evelyn jumps to, you don't need to understand every symbol in Penguindrum to recognize the beauty of the underlying story and its message.

So just buckle up and enjoy the ride - confusion and all. Many times the symbols just require a bit of thought or a small change in perspective like taking dialogue literally despite what the circumstances would suggest.

**Similarities? \[SPOILERS EEAAO AND PENGUINDRUM\]**

I try my best to avoid major spoilers except where marked. But those that don't want any spoilers steer clear.

1. **Humor**

Both shows have very similar absurd humor. I can't help but parallel the penguin's shenanigans to the stuff the jumpers have to do to verse-jump and the use sexual humor is also very similar. The famous [butt plug fight from EEAAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-gplbWy__Q) (obvious NSFW) seems straight out of Ikuhara's other show Sarazanmai with its [shirikodama extraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCFph_JYrTk) (also NSFW ). Penguindrum doesn't lack that same style in the slightest.

2. **Jobu Tupaki and Penguindrum's ""Fate""**

In both shows the characters struggle with feelings of helplessness after realizing their inability to change their circumstances.

For Jobu \[EEAAO\]>!happiness and sadness meaning nothing because she experiences everything at the same time. Even if she tries something in one verse and succeeds, in another it leads to disaster and her overall situation will remain the same. So she runs wild as a nihilistic agent of chaos and destruction. Her despair is verbalized as: !<

*""Just like the rest of your miserable lives, this is nothing more than a statistical inevitability.""  -Jobu Tupaki*

This is paralleled in Penguindrum by the idea of fate, where right from the first episode where Kanba says:

*""I hate the word ""fate."" Birth, encounters, partings, success and failures, fortune and misfortunes in life. If our lives are already set in stone by fate, then why are we even born? There are those born to wealthy families, those born to beautiful mothers, and those born into the middle of war or poverty. If that's all caused by fate, then God is incredibly unfair and cruel. Because, ever since that day, none of us had a future and the only certain thing was that we wouldn't amount to anything...""  -Takakura Kanba ep 1*

Major spoilers \[Penguindrum\]>!Ultimately, Kanba even goes on to make the same choice, joining Sanetoshi to do terrorist acts to destroy the world.!<

3. **Survival Strategies**

When I saw [this scene](https://youtu.be/uTcU2NQYZ9w?t=53) in EEAAO I couldn't help but immediately think of the [SEIZON SENRYAKUUU](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/fakz5u7bmgd91bf/peg1080.mp4) aka Survival Strategy sequence which often comes when characters in Penguindrum explain their various coping mechanisms. These characters are extremely unsatisfied with their situations, but powerless to change anything, must come up with ways to avert their eyes from the truth.

*""When I choose to see the good side of things, I'm not being naive. It is strategic and necessary"" - CEO Waymond*

\[EEAAO\]>!Evelyn takes it out on Waymond/dreams she is a star, Waymond looks at the bright side, Joy ignores all her problems and runs away, choosing to live alone. Jobu runs wild. !<

Major spoilers \[Penguidrum\]>!Kanba has his Kiba activities and playboy stuff. Shouma just takes it, feeling almost undeserving of happiness yet all the while feeling spiteful and unsatisfied. Himari is more positive but also lives vicariously through Double H!<

4. **Themes**

There is a lot in both shows about love and sacrifices that come with it. Take the scene where [Evenlyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmcyUtfmObo) \[EEAAO\]>!stands up to Gong Gong and risks her relationship with her parent!<commits a BIG taboo in Asian culture for Joy. I'd say it has major similarities to \[Penuindrum E22\]>!Ringo holding the burning diary to try and extinguish the fire,  Kanba risking his arm for Himari and of course the final Fate Transfer.!<

Both shows also have characters that ultimately accept there circumstances because with love, even trying times can be blissful. I think that these two quotes are enough but **major spoilers**.

\[EEAAO\]>!""In another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you"" -CEO Waymond!<

\[Penguindrum\]>!""I've been punished in small doses as a Takakura... but still we were together. We took all the punishments, no matter how small and trivial. They're all precious memories."" -Himari!<

5. **Surreal, extremely creative visual storytelling**

I think one major selling point of both shows is how visually creative they are. The verse jumping allows EEAAO explore, mix and match many different styles that culminate in this [amazing montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRvwwYlhH10) and Penguindrum also has equally bombastic sequences like [Seizon Senryaku](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/fakz5u7bmgd91bf/peg1080.mp4), and \[Penguindrum\]>!ringo's shoujo-esque delusions. !<

tl;dr Everything Everywhere all at Once and Penguindrum are both beautiful shows about family with exceptionally creative visual storytelling and similar humor. If you liked one and haven't watched the other, go give it a try. If you've watched both, I'd love to hear if you also found them similar.",smartredsheep,11,48,0.83

**Clow Card Fortune Book**

**Today's card:**

**[THE THROUGH](https://imgur.com/a/FE5ZBvy)**

The improvement of an unexpected situation.

**Playing Card when Substituted:** King of Clubs

**Card’s Message:**

The key to success is a change in perspective. When you change your way of life and thinking completely, it is very likely that your situation will improve for the better, and good luck will come your way. It is important to say ""Yes"" and ""No"" clearly.

**Card’s Warning:**

Even if a strong rival appears, face each other without tricks, fairly. They might turn out to be an unexpected cooperator.

> it's missing the third note in the sequence and so it feels like there's a missing stair in a staircase; I think it's a pretty good metaphor for the sort of grief that Renge is going through. ([Compare against the less-sad version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l265CJ7e9r4) at 0:23, or the [much-more-jaunty full theme version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v94U8_XpCFM)). I also like how the full version is called ""Sunlit Road"" (陽だまり道) and the sad version is ""Sunlit Road Continues"" (陽だまり道は続く), which I think spins it a bit more into a ""life will go on"" sort of way

81,[WT!] Show by Rock!! — A Music Fluffet,11u06oy,"*Show by Rock!!* is a... {checks notes}... [cute-girls-doing-cute-things](https://i.imgur.com/fvtRLNg.gif) [absurdist-comedy](https://i.imgur.com/SzGhr2P.jpg) [band](https://i.imgur.com/rn5N8hu.mp4) [drama](https://i.imgur.com/T5nQMNs.png) [isekai](https://i.imgur.com/IPmQGuw.jpg) about [saving](https://i.imgur.com/Aj1SERg.mp4) a [furry](https://i.imgur.com/mHv96nK.gif) [music world](https://i.imgur.com/6HoNRGk.jpg) from [evil monsters](https://i.imgur.com/Hj4MjC3.jpg) with [""edgy CGI Hello Kitty sequences""](https://i.imgur.com/7fKuy97.mp4) and [sentient eggs](https://i.imgur.com/pBiHkJP.jpg).

That's... [a lot](https://i.imgur.com/iXES2iP.png). So let's cut the intro and go straight to the most prominent and most important aspect of *Show by Rock!!*. No, [not you, Shuzo](https://i.imgur.com/93ShoZe.gif), I mean...

&nbsp;

## ***The Music***

In today's modern anime industry where seemingly every anime is part of a medix-mix project and producers will chase every possible merchandizing opportunity they can think of, it's no surprise that most ""music anime"" have a tie-in album or two you can buy after you watch the show. 

That's great, right?! You liked the anime, you liked the music in the anime, and now you can buy the music from the anime! 

But it is just the music *from the anime*. If, for example, you liked the music in *Ya Boy Kongming!* so much that you bought [the tie-in album](https://i.imgur.com/bEh2QRq.png) you'll get full versions of all the songs from the show, and hey you even get a bonus version of the Azalea song sung by Eiko... but that's it. Some shows you get one or two extra songs from the protagonist singer/band that weren't in the show, but even that is rare. If you really liked the sound of secondary characters like Azalea or, say, [the Mermaid Sisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-PWTsc0lC8) it's not like you can get an album of their music - they aren't even the protagonist band! What kind of anime would be crazy enough to have that?

Well, *Show by Rock!!* [is indeed crazy enough to have that.](https://i.imgur.com/GYlMqE9.jpg)

In fact, *Show by Rock!!* has that many times over. *Show by Rock!!* doesn't have an album... [it has a buffet](https://i.imgur.com/BmRgtco.png).

*Show by Rock!!* has [10 featured bands](https://i.imgur.com/aX5Inbz.mp4) spread across its four 12-episode seasons. Some of these bands might only play three or four songs in the entire show, but each one of those ten bands has at least one album's worth of songs that aren't in the anime at all - the fewest having 10 more songs, some of them having dozens of extra songs.

See, the company Sanrio one day decided to develop their own gacha-esque rhythm video game, and for whatever reason they didn't want to re-use their existing characters like Hello Kitty for it. So they casually invented dozens of new musician characters, put them into over twenty made-up bands (only ten of which are featured in the anime), and wrote and recorded hundreds of brand new songs for their new franchise. The *Show by Rock!!* anime is the tie-in TV show for this rhythm game, giving it some story, worldbuilding, and, most importantly, more exposure to its music.

The sheer size of this franchise's music catalogue is one of *Show By Rock!!'s* greatest strengths, and the anime is not afraid to put it on full display. This is not an anime that has the same two or three insert songs being used over and over again in each episode - almost every episode includes a new insert song, with a total of over 50 different insert songs across the four seasons.

Each of the ten [increasingly-difficult-to-pronounce](https://i.imgur.com/Ir5hvxo.mp4) bands has their own flavour of J-Pop:

* [Plasmagica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBB9tsn0eWI) mixes your the vocals of an energetic anime girls' band with heavy drums and rock'n'roll guitar.
* [SHINGANCRIMSONZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DhYEx9uHIQ) is an over-the-top chūnibyō-bishōnen kei band.
* [Dokonjofinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImEKmm0xcDE) is more metal-styled.
* [Criticrista](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJvUsHmp6b4) is your classic super-cutesy band of anime middle-schoolers.
* [REIJINGSIGNAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De0m_V_ynVI)'s leans into electronica and house music styles.

And that's just half of them! Like I said, it's a buffet - you may not like all of them, but with ten different styles and so many songs, there's probably something you're going to find and like.

Personally, I dig the shamisen-infused enka band [Tsurezure Naru Ayatsuri Mugenan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSMtgAa_mwM). Do they only get 3 actual performances in the show? Yup! Did I find thirteen other songs from them afterwards which I enjoyed? I sure did!

That's the biggest selling point of *Show by Rock!!*. It exposes you to dozens of songs by ten different bands with the promise that if you find something you like there *is* more to find, a promise not many music anime can make. And then when you do find a band you like, having a bit of moe backstory about the band makes listening to their songs more fun!

## ***But There is Also a Story, Right?***

There is!

Shy, awkward, Japanese high-schooler [Cyan Hijirikawa](https://i.imgur.com/ulVbizP.png) has been trying and failing to work up the nerve to ask to join her school's music club for months when she gets suddenly isekai'd to a music-addicted world where everyone just so happens to be an animal-human hybrid (unless they're an alien... or a robot... or an egg...). After saving a charming foxboy idol with a talking guitar, Cyan - [now turned into a *literal scaredy-cat*](https://i.imgur.com/UERqjSC.jpg) - ends up joining a struggling young band where she makes new friends and has musical experiences that will help shy Cyan overcome her anxieties, learn what it means to be a true friend, and [become a better musician](https://i.imgur.com/vPfLTyM.png), too. Along the way they'll meet, compete with, and learn from a bunch of other quirky bands... and also fight music-themed evil monsters to stop an evil record agency CEO from taking over the planet.

That's the story for the first season, anyway. The second season has such a fantastic cold open I'm not even going to talk about it, I don't want to spoil it. The third season switches to a new main protagonist band - [Mashumairesh!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzsB2znN0c) - and drops the isekai and monsters for a more straightforward cute-animal-girls/boys-doing-cute-things focus. Then season four caps off Mashumairesh!!'s story while bringing everyone together for a final victory lap.

Don't let the isekai or monster-fighting aspects fool you into thinking this is a serious show with a tight, continuous storyline. Those aspects do add some over-arching storyline to each season and some drama to a few performances, but it's mostly just at the start and end. By and large, you could almost call this show episodic, and most episodes are focused firmly on either comedy hijinks or band-related moe drama or both. 

On the band drama side of things, *Show by Rock!!* is mostly playing things pretty safe, treading the usual such plots: [rivalries](https://i.imgur.com/O3j43OZ.jpg), jealousy, [band members keeping secrets from each other](https://i.imgur.com/za6CPd6.png), getting depressed after a big loss, [disputes of artistic direction](https://i.imgur.com/LmJL0Qz.png), the pressure of writing a new song, etc.

The show's comedy, on the other hand, is a mad, [mad](https://i.imgur.com/DiyFzuH.jpg) ride, utterly lacking in [restraint](https://i.imgur.com/VKlqWR2.jpg). Of course there's nothing that ruins a joke better than a review trying to explain why it's funny, so I won't try to exhaustively detail how the humour works, but in general it's the sort of humour that puts its characters into simple-but-silly situations, and then rather than just move onto the next joke it will [dwell](https://i.imgur.com/8k4P6uA.jpg) on the situation in humourous ways and escalate the situation even more... and more... and more again, into absurd levels of silliness, while making jokes out of both the scenario itself and [the characters' reactions](https://i.imgur.com/sDnalH2.png).

When the dysfunctional boys need to get a part-time job the show doesn't just go for situational comedy about them being bad at working in, say, a convenience store. Instead, it plays off their idiot tough guy personas to have them look for a cool job, which ends up getting them duped into a cartoonish underground mining job [with pickaxes and minecarts](https://i.imgur.com/FPNn8P8.jpg), which of course turns into a silly macho competition, and then of course that somehow becomes a minecart chase through an active volcano (and there's still two escalations of the joke past that, but I won't spoil them).

It's the kind of comedy where the creators thought ""Oh hey, if everybody is going to be an animal-person, how about we make a phoenix-boy who is perpetually sick?"" and sure, that's funny enough, but then they thought ""how can we take that even further?"" and made him a high school delinquent phoenix-boy who gets his own little [almost-a-transformation-sequence](https://i.imgur.com/nNIePf8.mp4) of taking his pills and drinking his health shake before he gets into a fight.

Or when the girls get put on trial for domestic terrorism with a cranky judge and their lawyer seems incompetent, of course that situation is already funny as-is, and of course they'll have the lawyer [do the Ace Attorney thing](https://i.imgur.com/gW0srC9.jpg), but then they'll also make a joke out of Ruhuyu interrupting the proceedings because she was just so eager to try out the Ace Attorney reference herself, and then the whole scene will divert to a montage of each girl imagining what their 40 years in a progressively more ridiculous jail setting will be like, and then when the lawyer solves the case [the courtroom will turn into a dance  hall](https://i.imgur.com/RtvE1Yp.mp4) because *of course* this lawyer guy is in his own secret band and he celebrates winning a case with his own insert song.

In short, lots of [silly characters](https://i.imgur.com/P1rX4Zz.mp4) in lots of [silly situations](https://i.imgur.com/ZPyZpfp.jpg) leading to lots of [silly character animation](https://i.imgur.com/H4zICAk.mp4).

If this sounds like it's a very ""campy"" show - yes! It is *unrelentingly* campy! Everything is [an opportunity for a silly joke](https://i.imgur.com/xlxE9qk.png) and every conflict can be solved through [the power of music](https://i.imgur.com/2smcmyt.jpg) (or else the power of mint-devil laser beams). Ultimately, that's what makes the show more  [charming](https://i.imgur.com/1bXrcju.mp4) than it first appears, and makes up for how the actual story and band drama is pretty thin. 

All the [cute character designs](https://i.imgur.com/oqzghWT.png) certainly help, too.

You might even find that all the silly comedy hijinks have lowered your guard, and some of the tropey band drama or unexpected [bits of wholesomeness](https://i.imgur.com/DlTNR5I.jpg) actually end up having a stronger emotional impact on you than they have any right to.


&nbsp;

## ***What's This About Edgy CGI Hello Kitty Sequences?***

Okay, I guess I can't avoid this topic any longer.

So yes, this series has some [full-CGI sequences](https://i.imgur.com/tGCkm2w.mp4). They're used when the characters fight the evil monsters, are *sometimes* used during the music performances, and also for [the season 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaoaMtW_wT4) and season 2 EDs.

Episode 1 has both a CGI musical performance and a long monster sequence, so it gives the impression that this is going to happen in every episode, but that's not actually the case - there's only a handful of monsters in the whole series and there are just as many musical performances that never go into ""CGI mode"". Even the performances that do go into ""CGI mode"" usually only do it for part of the performance, or intercut the CGI sequence with 2D animation, as well.

So why does the show even do this, then? I don't really know, but it sure feels like it might have been some sort of franchise obligation the show had forced upon it. The CGI character models are noticeably more chibi, making them look both closer to how the characters appeared [in the rhythm game](https://youtu.be/NLhNG4C3kDo?t=389) and to [Sanrio's other brands](https://i.imgur.com/VA3Dqod.png).

For what it's worth, the CGI quality itself *is* pretty good, and in the first two seasons has an interesting moving-playdoh sort of aesthetic to it (in the latter seasons they swap [to a more cell-shaded look](https://i.imgur.com/M7K4Y9O.mp4)). They do take full advantage of it in some scenes to, for example, zoom in on characters actually drum to the beat or finger specific strings along with the song. But the show has plenty of good [2D performance animation](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/731df0d850235c9eb3703deaf196459b.mp4), too... and the CGI models have no mouths so they can't show much emotion or look like they're singing... while some of the 2D performances have [incredible singing animation](https://i.imgur.com/kPAeTHv.mp4), so...

...yeah, [I can't justify this](https://i.imgur.com/6sMxOQX.png). It's an annoying distraction at best and at worst will completely turn off some viewers. All I can say is there really isn't as much of it as the show's first impression implies.


&nbsp;

## ***Sub vs Dub?***

I respect the heck out of what the English Dub for this show tried to do - they actually redubbed almost every song in the show (except for the fourth season... possibly due to the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger?). A very, very brave undertaking.

Unfortunately, the Japanese voice actors are mostly professional musicians, while most of the English voice actors are... [not](https://i.imgur.com/UW8qATo.png). And this is a show where there's a dozen singing characters in the first season alone.

Furthermore, even with the English actors who *can* sing well, there's still an obvious difference in the quality of the recording - the dub still sounds like it was recorded [part-by-part in an ADR booth](https://i.imgur.com/VBlYBo7.jpg), not a full-fledged music studio.

I respect the ambition, but the best viewing experience is definitely the Japanese audio.

&nbsp;

## ***Is There Yuri?***

[Nope](https://i.imgur.com/DXOK6Kv.png). No coffee, either.

&nbsp;

## ***~~In Conclusion~~ Anything Else?***

Typically this is the part of the [WT!] where I'd try to make one last pitch or do a ""why you should watch it"" section, but I don't think *Show by Rock!!* really needs such a thing - it's not that complicated of a show. Either you find the idea of a musical buffet and [cute animal girl musicians](https://i.imgur.com/VjV1M1O.gif) interesting, or you don't. ~~Fluff~~ 'nuff said.

102,Lot of bad Gundam,11uq446,"It's weird saying this as someone who's seen all Gundam and who, if asked what I think about Gundam, I'd say it's great. But one thing I just thought was, for as well beloved and popular as Gundam is... there is a lot of bad, to straight up garbage Gundam shows, to the point where if the good ones were not as good as they are, I'd find it impossible for it to have the love and following it has. It almost reminds of Sonic in that a lot of them suck but when it's good it's really good so people still love it. Just to put it into perspective, here is a list of generally considered bad Gundam shows (yes you might like some of these but generally are considered not good).

1. Gundam ZZ (this might be the least bad one here)
2. Gundam F91
3. Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory (I hate this show)
4. Victory Gundam
5. Gundam Wing
6. Gundam SEED Destiny
7. Gundam AGE (I really hate this show for ruining such a great concept)
8. Gundam Reconguista in G

This list doesn't include things I consider bad like Char's Counterattack, or things that are so different I didn't feel right to include like MS IGLOO or Twilight AXIS but even just those ones alone there is almost as much bad Gundam as there is good.",peter123yeah,26,0,0.22

##**Show Information:**

[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9756) | [AniList](https://anilist.co/anime/9756/Mahou-Shoujo-MadokaMagica) | [ANN](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=12120) | [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io/anime/mahou-shoujo-madoka-magica) | [AniDB](https://anidb.net/anime/8069)

###**Synopsis:**

Having a loving family, close friends, experiencing times of joy and times of sadness. These are the things that make up an ordinary life.

Kaname Madoka is a normal 2nd year middle-schoolgirl who lives such an ordinary life. Until, that is, a strange encounter occurs. She does not know if this encounter is coincidence, or the vagaries of fate, but two things are certain...

This is the moment when her destiny changes...

This is the start of a new magical girl story!

(Taken from AniDB's translation/adaptation of the official site's writeup - I don't really like either the MAL or the ANN synopsis here.)

***[Official Trailer](https://www.viewpure.com/6CTHwEZK2JA?start=0&end=0)*** (wrapped in ViewPure to avoid any spoilers in recs)

###**Legal Streams:**

*As per [livechart.me](https://www.livechart.me/anime/3246); other streams may be available outside the US.*

**Main Series:**

[Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRDQK39GY) | [Funimation](https://www.funimation.com/shows/puella-magi-madoka-magica/) | [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/series/puella-magi-madoka-magica-085f5007-1b32-4dd7-9aea-41397554fb9b) | [VRV](https://vrv.co/series/GRDQK39GY)

(Livechart.me suggests that at least in the US both HBO Max and Netflix have lost the license since last year; HBO Max isn't a surprise with the rest of what the new suits have done to it, Netflix is.)

**Rebellion:**

No legal streams; as of 2022 the movie was available for purchase on iTunes and Amazon Prime Video, otherwise you will need to go [sailing](#piracy).

##**Why Should I Watch?**

If you were around for me running rewatches last year, you may remember me [praising the things OG Higurashi does right in spite of S1 having no budget and it being a bit lackluster as an adaptation](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/uhpw9s/gauging_interest_in_an_og_higurashi_no_naku_koro/) or [mentioning Mai-HiME's historical importance in addition to the things it does do right](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/wmvujp/rewatch_maihime_rewatch_announcement_and_index/).

My pitch to get you to watch Madoka Magica is much simpler: ***the show is actually that good***.

Or to borrow and repurpose a classic quote about *Hamlet*: The thing about Madoka Magica is that it really is very good, in spite of all the people who say that it is very good.

There are a short list of anime that I consider nearly essential watching for anyone trying to appreciate the medium as a whole, either by experience or by rep (yeah I haven't quite gotten around to all of that list myself, hi Utena and everything Dezaki).  Madoka Magica is either the first or second name on that list, and the only reason it's even a question is just how utterly foundational Evangelion is to the modern medium.  You don't necessarily have to like the work - heavens knows I didn't like Bebop when I tried it and that show is also firmly on the ""you should see this"" list - but IMO you owe it to yourself to at least try it and see for yourself.

The show admittedly does benefit from knowledge of its source genre (mahou shoujo/magical girls), which new viewers are less likely to have these days than they once were just due to the age of the genre.  (The ancestral form of the genre (often called the majokko show, wherein a young girl transforming into an older form to solve problems) is so old (mostly Showa era and thus pre-Akira) that most of its shows except the very late ones like Ojamajo Doremi have always been obscure in English-speaking countries (IIRC there were a few non-English dubs that were quite popular, notably a Spanish dub of Sally-chan that ran in Latin America).  In the early 1990s Sailor Moon took that older form of the genre and fused it with tropes from sentai (Japanese transforming superhero genre, usually a tokusatsu genre (tokusatsu properly refers to live action televised work with special effects, though Western fans tend to use it as a synonym for sentai) - Power Rangers is an American localization of a sentai show) and was a major smash hit, and aired on Toonami so was a gateway anime for a lot of Millennial girls in the US, and it is that form of the genre that Madoka Magica is drawing off of.  But Sailor Moon was thirty years ago and the other big magical girl hit in the US in Card Captor Sakura is 25 years ago now, and critically the modern 800-pound gorilla of kids-targeted mahou shoujo in the Precure franchise has never gotten a good dub, and as such Zoomers are much less likely to have grown up watching magical girl anime and learning the genre tropes that way.)  Luckily, however, while said knowledge of its genre is beneficial to appreciating Madoka Magica it is by no means necessary; indeed, I know multiple people who actually wound up getting into the genre as a whole because of Madoka Magica itself.

But really, the best way of explaining why you should watch this show is simple.  If you've been in a rewatch with me before, you may recognize my slowly-developed style of picking out shots that catch my eye and explain how they work cinematographically (usually paired with analysis and also theories if I am a first-timer).  The better the episode, the longer my notes tend to be; an average episode gets one page of notes, a good one may get two, and something really well-directed like Endless Eight 4 (the best-directed episode of Haruhi by a significant margin) can get three pages of notes.  And then there's Disappearance, a well-directed behemoth of a movie at 2:40 that clocked in at 7,500 words of notes.

... And then there's this show, because even strictly focusing on the cinematography (I did analysis *last* year and am not a first-timer) my notes for PMMM episode 4 alone this year are *over 10,000 words long*.

The show is *that* fucking well made.

(Admittedly our first-timers won't be able to read most of said notes until we are done because a lot of shots need the context of the full series to reveal exactly what they are doing so said notes will be hiding under spoiler tags.  PMMM's reputation for rewatch bonus is very well earned - and the staff knew it, they were going on record recommending that fans buy the BDs to see how the story changes on second watch *before the show even aired*.  So if you watched the show once, I highly recommend hopping in as a first time rewatcher.  You have seen this show once?  To paraphrase [Girl Genius](https://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20160201): you have not, I think, seen this show *at all*.

Oh, and did I mention that PMMM is on the shortlist of shows nearly guaranteed to be mentioned whenever the question of ""what is the best anime OST"" comes up?  And that I am doing OST integration writeups again?  (Don't have to do OST tables this time, though... u/Nazenn did them for me a few years back so I can just re-up his!)

###**Wait!  What Is a Rewatch, Anyways?**

Glad you asked!

To quote the subreddit wiki:

>A rewatch is like a book club, a way for the community to come together and discuss non-airing anime in a format similar to episode threads for currently airing shows, usually one episode a day or in small batches so viewers can focus on discussing the events as they go through the anime rather than the series as a whole in a single thread. They're a great way for new viewers to experience a series as well as any spoilers for later in a series are generally not allowed.
>  
>&nbsp;  
>  
>See one that you want to join as a participant? There's no formal process, hop into an ongoing rewatch thread through the links below or searching for the Rewatch flair and start discussing the series. Be aware that discussing events beyond the current episodes of a rewatch usually isn't allowed without [spoiler tags](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/q28ulr/announcing_changes_to_spoiler_tags/).  

How people participate varies; depending on the person, you'll see anything from live bullet point reactions as they're watching to essays to shitposts  and fanart to lengthy literary analysis (which may or may not hidden under spoiler tags, because while the rewatcher analyses likely will be judging from past years we're bound to get at literary analysis from at least one first-timer) to ~~OST tables~~ oh wait Naz already did those several years ago, heh.

That said, rewatchers and partially spoiled first-timers:  Please be careful about spoilers; we really wouldn't want to ruin the experience for our first-timers, would we?  Make sure to hide your spoilers under the “spoiler” option, or by typing your spoiler as [Episode number] >\!Spoiler here!\< in the mark-down option without the slashes.

So, interested?

##**Okay, I'm In, What's the Schedule?**

Glad you asked!  Especially since I am making one new alteration to the schedule relative to the past rewatches: *we will be having both a Main Series Discussion day* **and** *an Overall Discussion day this year*.  Rebellion is long (though it's an ordinary 2-hour movie and not The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya), and both the main series and Rebellion (especially the latter) benefit from time to sit back and digest them.

The one-week reminder thread will go up on April 14 and the one-day reminder thread will go up on April 20.

Episode threads will go up at 5:00 P.M. EDT each day (4:00 P.M. CDT) - that's UTC -5 for our Europeans, IIRC.

**Episode** | **Date**
---|----
Episode 1 | April 20
Episode 2 | April 21
Episode 3 | April 22
Episode 4 | April 23
Episode 5 | April 24
Episode 6 | April 25
Episode 7 | April 26
Episode 8 | April 27
Episode 9 | April 28
Episode 10 | April 29
Episode 11 | April 30
Episode 12 | May 1
Main Series Discussion | May 2
The Rebellion Story | May 3
Overall Discussion | May 4

##**Time for Club Activities!**

We will be having a few different daily activities to drive participation (though it's not like the show usually needs it):

- Visual of the Day album (pick a shot from the episode you want to highlight, or up to three in the case of Rebellion, and if I get five entries including my own I will put up an album of them)
- Question(s) of the Day
- Theory of the Day (for the first-timer with the most interesting theory in their writeup that day; these do not have to be correct, mind you!)
- Analysis of the Day (for the best piece of analysis in the writeups that day; this is open to first-timers but primarily aimed at encouraging rewatcher participation, and it is expected that most winners here will be under spoiler tags - something for our first-timers to look forward to reading after we are finished!)

##**A Reminder to Rewatchers:**

Please do not spoil the experience for our first timers.  In particular, [PMMM] >!Mentioning beheading, cakes, phylacteries/liches, the **ma**hou shou**jo** pun, aliens, time travel, or the like outside of spoiler tags before their relevant episodes is a fast way to get a referral to the subreddit mods.  As Sky would put it, you're probably not as subtle as you think you're being.  Leave that sort of thing for people who *can* do subtle... namely the show's creators themselves.  (Seriously, go hunt down all the visual foreshadowing of a certain episode 3 event in episode 2, it's fun!)!<

##**And a Word of Warning to First-Timers:**

Be wary about your inboxes, especially early on; people have tried to spoil first-timers in each of the last two years IIRC (via replies one year and PMs the other) and also IIRC at least once a few years before that.  (There is a small but dedicated PMMM hatedom out there, and I hear one of the most infamous examples has been active on Tumblr again lately.)  But don't worry *too* much.  After all, it's not like your host would do something like, say, intentionally coordinate with the mod team to use alt accounts to seed false spoilers as chaff for anyone trying to ruin the first-timer experience with actual spoilers, right?  Right?

104,Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt: Bandit Flower; It was a movie?,11u6w3k,"Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt: Bandit Flower: I don't have a lot to say about this movie, it's whatever. I could probably sum this movie up in one sentence, “it was an anime”.  It's not down right terrible, it's still a fun watch. There's just barely anything that makes this movie stand on its own or adds shit that doesn't make any sense. I can at least say that the music and the fights are just as good as the last movie (mostly the music). So let's dive right in

* Plot: 
   * Months after the One Year War, a Federation sub group known as the South Seas Alliance becomes independent and has in possession the Psycho Zaku. So it's up to the Moore Brotherhood and the Living Dead Division to steal back the suit before they learn how to use it.
   *  That's actually a pretty good plot, I just wished the anime actually followed it. This is one of the few anime that has the plot told to us and it doesn't even follow up on it. All they really do for the rest of the movie is play music and fight mobile suits here and there. 
   * The MB or the LDD don't even encounter each other either, which is a wasted opportunity. Hell, the LDD don't even do much until the end where they have to get this info broker something. And to make matters worse, the South Seas Alliance, the main baddies of the movie, barely shows up in it. They don't even feel like antagonists until the last chunk of the movie, where they serve more of a minor inconvenience instead of an actual threat. So the plot is basically non existent, but stuff happens at the very least.
* Characters: 
   * most of the characters from the last movie return, and I'm just happy they're here. But the new characters….. Let's just say that calling them a mixed bag would be generous. They're not bad enough to ruin the anime for me like the majority of the Destiny characters, but most of them are undercooked and don't even add much to the story. But I'm getting ahead of myself. 
   * Let's start off with the Feddies, Io’s back and that instantly saves this anime for me. I'm just happy to see this Jazz loving son of bitch again, he's a treat to the Gundam community that people don't appreciate enough. His buddy Cornelius is back too, he doesn't do too much either, but his appearance is still appreciated. And that's it for the Feddies from the last movie I'm pretty sure, now onto the newbies. Bianca Carlyle also saves this anime for me, as she was a really fun character. She was charismatic and trustworthy, plus her playing the piano with Io playing the drums in that Groovy Duel scene was actually pretty good. I also kinda like the Captain of the Spartan, Vincent Pike, as he was actually a cool character and I would've liked more scenes of him getting his crew’s shit together. I also kinda like that core fighter pilot, Barclay. He seems chill and I would kill for more fighter pilots. If we gave him scenes interacting with the characters, he could've been a pretty interesting character. 
   * And then everyone else is useless. Monica Humphrey only exists to give exposition and not much else, and her manservant Josh adds nothing to the story. And then we got these 5 bozos who just exist to hate on Io for the movies. As for why they hate him? Well I can't tell you, because I don't know. The only one who actually says why she doesn't like Io is Alicia, as she hated that he used kids as meat shields in the last movie. Has anyone ever told this bitch that it wasn't his idea? That he was even disgusted by the idea himself. Hell, he was even willing to buy their drinks himself (non-alcoholic I hope). As for the other 3, Orphe, Harvey Dent, and Cosmonaut Marcus, just make comments about him and that's it. They really don't have any personality outside of that. The Black TriStars from Unicorn have more personality than these 3, and they had less screen time. There's also this blonde chick who does stuff on the ship and it doesn't matter. Not exactly a good start for the characters. 
   * Onto the Zeeks, and they're basically the same as the last movie (both in a good and meh way). Starting off with the returning ones, Daryl Lorenz comes back, and remember that powerful scene of him looking at his prosthetic arm and giving us that “what have I done” facial expression? We this movie decides to throw that into the trash. The whole movie doesn't even acknowledge that he sacrificed everything to beat the Gundam and he just goes on with his life. He does seem to be affected by Karla’s mental condition, which I'll get to in a bit. 
   * As for Fisher, he's still a good buddy to Daryl. It's not saying much but it's something. As for Karla, she's literally in one scene, and it's actually kinda effective. In the last movie she went fucking bananas after seeing her crewmates get beamed to nothing by a GM (like any normal human being would), and new has a mind of a child. I thought that scene after Daryl goes out with her, she calling daddy (not in that way), and being told about her condition was pretty effective and showed us how things are gonna take a while to get better. It would've been better if it was fleshed a lot more, but I'll take it. 
   * On to the newbies, there's only 2 memorable bozos here Ober… I mean Billy Hickam (who's also voiced by Todd Haberkorn) and his black buddy Seth. Billy is a cocky NewType who wants to spite Daryl for some reason and Seth being his Tolkien black pal who doesn't really do much. And honestly the names of the other new Zeeks are forgettable, so I'm not even gonna bother. 
   * And I think that's…. wait. Oh ya there's another faction of characters, the South Seas Alliance. Calling them lackluster would kinda be a compliment. These are supposed to be our terrifying antagonists (again, I'll get to that later), and yet they feel like an afterthought. The head honcho, Levan Fuu, only appears for 2 scenes. At the beginning as a kid spouting some NewType nonsense and the end as a baldie in front of the repainted Psycho Zaku. We don't know anything about him, we don't even know his or his cult’s motivation, he's just the face of the SSA and nothing else. 
   * And then we get to his followers. I'm just gonna get this out of the way, Chow Mein is an annoying character and is very uninteresting. Saxton only shows in a picture and doesn't even show up for a single scene. And all of the monks are your standard “bad guy foot soldiers units”. 
   * But there's one characters that had no right to be in this, Claudia Peer. Now 1st of all, how the fuck did she survived? Because the last time we saw her, she fucking exploded. People in the Gundam Universe survive the most insane shit. You can dodge car sized bullets at point blank range, but if the plot still needs you, you should be fine. You can have your ass, dick, and balls burnt off from an explosion, but as long as the plot needs you, you'll be fine. But this woman was shot in the admin, which pierced her normal suit, and then she was sucked into the vacuum of space with NO OXYGEN. I wouldn't even be mad if it's just the plot armor, I'm mainly mad cuz they brought her back for NO REASON. She barely does anything outside of making Io & Bianca join the fight, which I'm pretty sure was gonna happen anyways, making her inclusion all the more meaningless. What's worse is that Cherami is given next to nothing for this movie, so her acting is not as impactful. You had my girl Asuna acting her Kuchi off in the last movie and now you're basically made her a background character. 
   * Overall the characters are a hit or miss. Some of them made the movie 10% better, some aren't giving as much but makes the most out of their appearance, while others make Aqua look more useful. Honestly, some of the characters could be cut out of the movie and it barely changes anything. 
* World building: 
   * Ok, the world building is actually not half bad. For one, we got to see more of what was going on during the battle of A Baou Qu. We see the Feddies breaking into the base, Io and the boys breaking out of prison, Bianca fending off against a Baow Bro, and so on. I'm not sure if it's even canon or not, but I'll take it.
   *  I can also appreciate that it's another Gundam anime that's set before Zeta, but not during the One Year War. But we don't really see a whole lot. We do see Sydney after the Colony Drop, but not much else. 
   * One thing that always got me curious was Daryl and Karla's “date”. In a scene after a funeral from the fight in the snow (which was a really good scene), we see them hang out in some sort of forest with a small family who gave them a jar of honey and some toast to go with that. And then they head back to the Zeonic base. And I don't mean they catched a ride there, the entrance was part of the forest. So it makes me wonder, was the whole forest fabricated or did the owner of said forest allow Zeonic soldiers to build a base on his property. The former seem a little too much just for Karla's mental condition. I know she's the only one with any vital information on the Reuse Psycho Device, but it seems like a lot just to get her memory back, especially with the amount of resources they would need for that. And if it's the latter, would the landowner be chill with the Zeeks controlling his property? Sure, he could be a Zeonic sympathizer, but he's already risking a lot for a group that isn't even compensating him. It's a good scene, don't get me wrong. I'm just curious, that's all.
   * But the one thing that could've saved the story, is the lore of the South Seas Alliance. These guys are A FUCKING CULT OF MIND CONTROLLING MONKS, How can't you make them good antagonists. Especially with how they're presented in the beginning, with them salvaging damaged mobile suits and ships while burning the corpses of the dead pilots. These guys would have served as terrifying villains, but then the movie forgets about them till the end. 
   * But the one thing I stay consistently good throughout these movies is absolutely the music. Groovy Duel, Hone Kudakete, more great bangers with Japanese names I can't remember, Thunderbolt definitely has the best OST out of any Gundam series, as it absolutely carries the movie. Their music is definitely filling up my playlist. The best of the music was during the aftermath of the snow fight. No dialogue, no sound effects, just a slowed down version of groovy duel playing in the background while our characters are cleaning up the mess and mourning the loss of their comrades. 
   * The world building is not half bad, but it could use a little work. It would've been a little better if it had some form of connecting tissue with Stardust memory (or at the very least, make some references), since they're 3 yrs apart. Overall, I was a little more invested in the world building than the actual story.
* Mobile Suits: 
   * Another thing that's luckily preserved in the sequel, are the mobile suits. Although there's not really any returning mobile suits (which can be a good or bad thing, depending on you), there's a good variety on both sides. But before I get to the suits, I want to talk about the vehicles. I don't typically care about them since the main focus are the mobile suits, I do like how they're presented. Especially when it came to the Core Fighter and Corvette Booster. That dogfight at the beginning with the Dopps was great. And then the Corvette Booster working in tandem with the GM was cool too. 
   * Now on to the main course meal. The Federation has a pretty good roaster, start off with the main Gundam itself, the Atlas. It looks good. Io always get the best toys, as this amphibious baby comes with a Rail gun, shield that shoots out bubble gum, an assault rifle, and the jack of all trades Duel wielding beam sabers. We need more MS with Rail-guns, cuz DAMN this thing packs a punch. And since its amphibious, it can use both it's boosters and shield as a boogie board. I'm not gonna question whether it's part of the UC canon or not. 
   * I will however question the continuity on the rest of the MS. Starting with the Gundam Ground Type S, although it seems like it's a capable unit, it looks off. And I'm talking about it's lack of v fin, since those exist. For starters, I'm pretty sure that they didn't use beam javelins in the official UC, their shields are supposed to be smaller, they never operated in space, and… Ahhh you seen 08th MS Team, you got the idea. 
   * Same thing for the GM Ground Type C, because a.) The original GM ground type was only developed into the GM Sniper, Blue Destiny Unit 0, and that red one that's 3x harder to find than a regular GM Ground Type, and b.) Type C was only given to the GM Kai technically. However, I do like how Io uses this GM when his Atlas is out of commission, just to prove that he's a dope ass pilot with or without the Gundam. 
   * The Guntank got its chance to shine for a change, so that's nice. The GM Aqua Types and the Guncannon Aqua were cool until they got crushed by ice and got shredded by robo crabs. 
   * I should get to the Zeeks now, should I? The 1st MS I was surprised they brought in was the Zaku II Dozle Zabi custom. Especially since it was probably destroyed during the Battle of Solomon. Then it could've been a repaint, I dunno. I do know that it's never a good idea to reload in front of a corp of mobile suits, as the EZ8 taught us. 
   * There's also some redesigns of the Z’Gok and Gogg, the former being hard to handle until they get covered in gum. And latter actually be a terrifying design with a savage ass entrance as it kills a Ball pilot in a gruesome way. I was surprised they also used mobile armors like the Bigro and Grublo. They made some good fight scenes. Too bad they were only there for said fight scenes.
   *  And finally we got the Acguys, and they're certainly different from each other. In the beginning they just use the standard type. But once they get their mission to find their snitch, that's when they begin slapping a lot of shit on it. Daryl’s Acguy (the enemy search type) has literally no weapons. Just goggles, Eledore’s stick thingy, and a sensor arm. The damn thing already has 2 sensor thingys, why in god's name would you have another one on your fucking arm. Couldn't you switch that out with a standard Acguy arm that can shoot beams and missiles right? For an ace sniper, could've used the extra firepower. Speaking of which, let's talk about the rest of the Zeonic county bears, the Firepower (A&B), Heavy Firepower, and the Maneuver type (A&B, I was expecting it to be called the high mobility type since that's Zeon called all of their fast mobile suits). I can at least say that they're better equipped. Machine Guns, missile launchers, a rocket launcher they stole from the Hygogg, more missiles, a heat hawk, spare ammo, tripping wire, floating explosives, and a shield thicker than Rinko’s milkers. All with some actual use, except for 2 weapons. That dinky ass knife and a flame thrower. That knife is just a tiny ass double blade held with a wimpy ass arm. As the old saying goes, “don't bring a knife to a gunfight”. And then the latter, WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU USE A FLAME THROWER? There's 2 reasons why using this thing is stupid. You're in the forest with flammable trees. As we learned from one of these dumbasses using the heat hawk at the wrong time, any source of fire would signal the enemy in an instant. And secondly, YOUR OFF AGAINST WALKING TANKS MADE OUT OF SPACE METAL. Burning them with flame ain't gonna do a whole lot. Again, they should've brought some beam weapons. This a franchise, with laser swords and laser guns, and yet they used a flamethrower. Not even the “rule of cool” can justify this. 
   * And finally we got the South Seas Alliance, they only have 2 mobile suits. I wish these guys had a bigger roster of mobile suits that's a mix of Federation and Zeonic suits, especially since they're known for salvaging mobile suits. But their Dahles and Goufs aren't half bad. The Dahle is basically your standard self-insert MC in MS form and I like they use a mix of Feddie and Zeonic equipment. One minute they're using a beam saber, next thing you know they're using a heat hawk. I wish we got more mobile suits that can use any weapon they pick up like in a TPS/FPS. And then we got the Gouf troop. It's really cool to see them using flight packs that's carrying troops, it's cleavers and pretty resourceful. I also like that it's more like the Gouf custom with it's 3 barreled machine gun and electric wire. They even thrown in a bazooka and heat sword that actually heats up for good measure. They have the Psycho Zaku too, but it's literally used for sequel bait. 
   * So ya, the roster ain't bad, I'm just hoping some of these would end up in GBO2 eventually since we got the GM Ground Type C with the Corvette Booster already. 
* Vertic: 
   * If it weren't for the funky OST, bombastic fight scenes, interesting MS designs, and some of the returning yet charming cast of characters, this would honestly be a mediocre movie. It doesn't follow the plot it gives itself, the majority of the new characters barely add anything, and it doesn't even it uses it's antagonist till the very end of the movie. Honestly the worst thing about this movie is that it feels more like sequel bait with that ending felt shoehorned in. It wouldn't be that bad if a sequel actually followed suit. Especially if considered that this came out a 6 FUCKING YEARS AGO. And December Sky came out a year before it, making us wonder where the hell is that next movie? The manga these movies are based on are still ongoing. As for whether or not the 3rd will be made, there's been many conflicting reasoning on why it hasn't been made yet. Whether it be the creator’s health issues or they're waiting for more Gundam content to come out. If the 3rd movie comes out and it sucks ass, I think I'm gonna lose it. So ya, not Destiny levels of bad, but not really good enough to stand toe to toe with it's predecessor. 7/10, it's certainly is an anime.",Yakuza-wolf_kiwami,3,0,0.5

At 4:19, when she says ""kitto"" I felt really nostalgic for some reason. I am 100% sure that there is another anime song out there, but instead of ""kitto"" they say ""zutto"". The straight tone stretch of the ""oooo"" at the end is the EXACT SAME, including the reverb. My memory is faulty but I also think the song I'm trying to remember has a few english (engrish) words, if that helps narrow things down.

The singer is a female with a slightly higher pitched voice and I think the ""zutto"" part gets sung for a bit longer than in this one.

I'm also pretty sure the ""zutto"" part is AFTER or at the end of the chorus, I remember it sounding really powerful and the song possibly ends (starts winding down) after this. The lyrics is based on love I think, but I'm confident the anime it comes from is not a main romance (could be main action, sub romance).

I will unironically **paypal anyone $20** if they can find this song. I'm sorry for the lack of information, but the part at 4:19 is **EXTREMELY EXTREMELY similar** to what I'm thinking of.

EDIT: To help narrow things down more, I don't think any of the famous anisingers like LiSA, Aimer, Reona, ASCA, sung the song I'm thinking of. Their voice sounds like Chiai Fujikawa from Rising of Shield Hero's ED 1 + 2, but that's not the song I'm thinking of.",lolman1312,10,1,0.56

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

First comment of the day goes to /u/AmusedDragon

> Oh my god Elaina(Saya) is in love with herself...? So nothing has changed, then.

Second comment of the day goes to /u/Esovan13

> I like the subtle way the show displays the difference between Elaina and Saya. Elaina is an experienced traveller, used to going to all kinds of places. So the first thing she did in the city is find an inn and put an ear out to the local gossip. Because of that, she heard about the potential danger and took measures to be able to sightsee without getting into trouble (though that didn't quite work out). Saya is a traveller of sorts as well, but she travels as part of essentially a government job, and she's been doing it for a much shorter time than Elaina. So she went straight into town, drawing attention by staying on her broom even when no one else was (did you notice that Elaina usually went around on foot except for the Country of Mages and Royal Celestia where it was common for the locals to use their brooms?) and going straight to do her job before learning about the city she's in or finding a place to stay. The difference in experience and purpose. It was there as well in the Country of Truth Tellers with the street fight where Elaina kept to the sidelines and used it as an opportunity to talk to a local and learn more about the city and it's people while Saya just barged straight in and broke the fight up without learning anything about the place or why the fight was even happening.

Last comment goes to /u/fieew

> Overall, I like the show. But honestly I don't love it. I just feel it doesn't have an identity. The world building has been decently lately with all the character meeting or going to the same places I loved that. But every town feels eh to me. Like they're not unique we get to a town all I can think is ""what's your gimmick? "" do they love dolls, or have bandits, or a wall, etc. They all feel defined by a single gimmick and not really lived in if that makes sense. Other slice of life feel they have a world and identities mushishi had an amazing vibe and creatures , girls last tour has a melancholy feels in a post apocalyptic world, aria is so unabashedly cheesy and in an Italian inspired world, non non biyori is so chilled in the country side. I can tell you about the world in all the these shows. We don't just go to different towns but instead we get to learn about individuals in different situations and towns in these shows making us feel more connected (minus non non biyori) to their world even if we see less of it compared to Elaina. Meanwhile with Elaina we travel so much but I feel we don't see day to day life in most situations instead we get a gimmick for a town Elaina solves it and moves on. We don't get many personal stories so I dont feel as connected to thw world. I like this show but I want a bigger slice for this slice of life show. I want things to be a bit slower so we see more people in town's living their lives out of something Elaina needs to solve.

115,[Rewatch] The Ancient Magus' Bride - OVA 1-3,11tcj4g,"OVA 1-3: *Those Awaiting a Star, Part 3*

[← Previous Episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11sfg0e/rewatch_the_ancient_magus_bride_ova_12/)| [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/10t22wg/the_ancient_magus_bride_rewatch_announcement_and/)| [Next Episode →](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11u9z5e/rewatch_the_ancient_magus_bride_episode_14/)

**Fae Facts:**

The Mayoiga is a phantom house in the mountains that is said to bring wealth to those who visit it, or a folktale about those who visit that house. It's been written about by various authors over decades, and there's even a mayoiga [anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32438/Mayoiga), although its rating is quite low.

**Discussion Topics:**

The library held Miura captive, but became a place of escape for Chise. What reason or message do you take from this?

**BTS:**

While trying to find information about the books mentioned in the OVA, I came across an original score written and available online by a man named Brett Heffelfinger, available [here](https://www.bjhcompositions.com/those-awaiting-a-star) and set against the OVA playing in the backdrop. It's a different way to experience the story, that's for sure!

**Selected Favourite Quotes and Images from Last Episode:**

[image album](https://imgur.com/a/nGUjbq3)

""I can forget all my problems when I'm reading""

"" I love reading the last page of a book more than anything.""

**Discussion Topics For Tomorrow, Episode 14:**

\[Question 1\]>!Was Joel and Leanan Sidhe’s love a curse? Or a blessing?!<

\[Question 2\]>!What do you think was Ashen Eye's goal in giving Chise the fox form?!<",blackninjakitty,32,36,0.92

127,Ergo Proxy deserves to be better known and watched by more people,11skn7a,"This anime isn't talked about much here, I guess it may be ""old"" for most redditors nowadays?

I can not recommend it enough, it's probably my favourite of all I've watched.

It's a thinker's anime, takes place in a post apocalyptic kinda landscape and will have you thinking about life, the nature of the self, our relationship with nature, machines, AI etc.

The art and music are beautiful and the plot is convoluted enough to keep you guessing and wanting for more.

It's produced by Manglobe, directed by Shūkō Murase and written by Dai Satō. 

It's 23 episodes of around 25 minutes.

Do yourself a favor, find it and watch it.

129,help me find this anime,11t8d1u,"So I saw this from a yt short a few months ago and at that time I found the name of the anime and it was quite popular, a bit old tho. But, today when I was thinking about it, I could not remember it nor find it so I know only a part of it and I hope somebody can recognise it.

So it was either an isekai or fantasy. And it has a annoying girl, cute, light coloured hair (white i think though not sure) and people thought she was like Aqua from konosuba. She and a few others were in a cave of jail cell I think and the MC got some food. And she said she didn't want any so the MC started to eat it with another girl. And the white haired girl started pouting and crying. It felt like a comedy to me and the girl was as I said popular and was like Aqua. So that's only what I remember.",Dangerous_Train796,14,5,0.73

An example I can think of is the first OP of Spy x Family

If you listen to the song really closely, you might discover that there are actually 1 or 2 instruments playing that are really hidden in the background that you probably didn't notice when you were just listening to the song casually

142,[Rewatch] The Ancient Magus' Bride - OVA 1-2,11sfg0e,"OVA 1-2: *Those Awaiting a Star, Part 2*

[← Previous Episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11rh5jl/rewatch_the_ancient_magus_bride_ova_11/)| [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/10t22wg/the_ancient_magus_bride_rewatch_announcement_and/)| [Next Episode →](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11tcj4g/rewatch_the_ancient_magus_bride_ova_13/)

**Fae Facts:**

Second sight, or true sight - the ability to see the fae and spirits. Although in anime it is typically depicted as something you were born with, there are many stories in British mythology of folks gaining the sight through interactions with the fae, and it could even sometimes be passed on through contact with a person who had it.

**Discussion Topics:**

Did you have a special sanctuary or hideaway like that when you were a child?

**BTS:**

Like many names in anime, Chise’s has strong meaning behind it:

The name **Chise** means ""wisdom, intellect"" (智) (chi) and ""generations"" (世) (se), which literally means ""the wise generation"" altogether.

Chise's surname **Hatori** means ""feather"" (羽) (ha) and ""bird, poultry, fowl"" (鳥) (tori), which literally means ""wing of a bird"" altogether.

**Selected Favourite Quotes and Images from Last Episode:**

### **Comment(s) of the Day**


Comment of the day goes to /u/Esovan13

Episodes 10 and 11 are brought to you by...volume 5?!  What are you doing here? Moving past volume three and completely bypassing volume 4, we're taking a short visit to the fifth volume. Yesterday, I mentioned that the choice of stories was deliberate to create a flow for the anime. In that case, it was that Mirarose and Nino contained elements that was used in the story with Selena. In this case, it ties together the human relationships Elaina has.

Episode one was Elaina and Fran's origin, episode 2 was Saya's. Episode 5 was a reunion with Fran, episode 6 a reunion with Saya. Episode 8 we met Sheila and learned her relationship to Saya, and in this episode we learned the origin and nature of the relationship between Sheila and Fran. Tomorrow, all four characters will be in the same city at the same time, along with a mysterious box. But I have no more to say about that until then.

Actually, now that I think about it, episode 7 showed a glimpse of Nike for the first time with the wall country before her much longer appearance in this episode. The wine village had a similar theme to the wall country in the form of quarreling neighbors learning to get along. Plus, I mentioned Nino's story had similarities to Selena's and the flower country in the same episode had a similar role as Nino in showing the tragedies that can be caused by the magic of the world while Nino's showed the mundane. I never realized before, but all the stories chosen to be put in the anime adaptation has some kind of connection with at least one of the other stories. Huh. I think I have an even better appreciation of the adaptation now.

Second comment of the day goes to /u/redekj for posting...𝓢𝓮𝔁𝓲𝓵𝔂. 

> oh dear Lord I feel a new fascination growing within me. 

Also while not a comment congratulations are in order for the newest witch /u/Elimin8r who shall forever me known as(or at least until end of this rewatch) as the 𝓢𝓮𝔁𝔂 𝓦𝓲𝓽𝓬𝓱.

Synopsis:

Due to a tragic accident, Banri Tada is struck with amnesia, dissolving the memories of his hometown and past. However, after befriending Mitsuo Yanagisawa, he decides to move on and begin a new life at law school in Tokyo. But just as he is beginning to adjust to his college life, the beautiful Kouko Kaga dramatically barges into Banri's life, and their chance meeting marks the beginning of an unforgettable year.

After having a glimpse of college life, Banri learns that he is in a new place and a new world—a place where he can be reborn, to have new friends, fall in love, makes mistakes and grow. And as he begins to discover who he was, the path he has chosen leads him towards a blindingly bright life that he will never want to forget.

**Why Should I watch Golden Time?**

Golden Time is a romantic comedy set in college, unlike most romantic comedies, which are set in high school. This leads to the show having much more mature characters, and most drama is taken more seriously, and it doesn’t feel like a bunch of kids in unnecessary drama.  

The show is very funny, and it can also be very emotional as each episode feels like it ended in just 5 minutes! https://imgur.com/a/pjXFgfE",One-Imagination2301,18,53,0.95

For me there seem to be poor plot twists that i couldn't care less about. Also its slightly offending how they are showing serious topics such as murder and kidnapping so lightly, I DO know the fact that Ikebukuro is used to it, but still it feels like everything that is happening (even mystery aspects) have complete comedic aspects of it. Don't get me wrong I do like the characters and their backstories, but it feels like a fun anime which is trying to be serious but failing real hard, im not criticizing but im slightly disappointed and I dont see the hype living up well on the episodes i am on.

Does it get serious?",weishenmyguy,10,0,0.35

**Synopsis**:


*""Cute girls doing cute things in cute ways.""*

Everyday things make up the fabric of life—whether it's making friends, going to school, trying to make money, or celebrating a holiday. Ichigo Mashimaro is a heartwarming series depicting the everyday life of four pre-adolescent girls and their older sister figure, Strawberry Marshmallow (Ichigo Mashimaro in the original Japanese) doesn't have excessive drama, or supernatural events, or giant robots. Just the antics of five girls, two 12 year olds, two 11 year olds, acting somewhat cuter and funnier than perhaps is entirely realistic, and their questionably high schooler older sister. 

---

##Why should you watch it?

Ichigo Mashimaro is a chill out SOL comedy with close to zero fanservice (unless you think Coppola dressing up as a cute girl count as fanservice)

Yes, honest! Believe it or not but I don't only host questionably ecchi series!! I'm back to my roots for this one. After the mentally exhausting KnJ and the physically draining KissxSis I think we all deserve a break and to return to the joys of the mid 00's moe slice of life scene. 

Ichigo Mashimaro is a 2002 *Shonen* manga by Lolicon Legend Barasui who channeled his wise knowledge and craft into making this relaxed and chilled out healing manga about a questionable high school delinquent getting her daily dose of moe from her kid sister and her friends. It has spawned the 2005 anime adaptation that we will be watching along with a visual novel. That right, Ichigo E-Sports over here! 

Fans of moe, slice of life, iyashikei, and cute kids doing cute things will be right at home. There is some depth behind the show if you decide to dedicate yourself to searching it out but you can sit back and bask in the healing comfort of the 00's if you so prefer.

I would lastly love to see everyone picking out a screenshot or visual of the day that caught your eye. Don't be shy, we all know why we're here!      
And for our fourth section, I'm pleased to be bringing back **Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!""** In this section I will be posting a preview pic of the following episode. Your challenge is to dedicate a small write up about the ""thematic"" purpose of said scene~ The best submission will get a dedicated spot in our patented Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene winner's corner!!""

162,Where Do You See Anime Going in 5-10 Years?,11rij4t,"I've recently become interested in anime genre trends across the decades, seeing how certain genres come in and out of favor, how they evolve with time, etc. I know its probably not something people think about too often, but I was wondering what predictions people have for the future of this medium.

For my money, I think its pretty safe to say that isekai's on its way out and Dark Battle Shounen will soon replace it as the dominant genre in the medium just based on previous trends. All pretty safe bets, but I'm curious what y'all think and if you've got any guesses on what will become the new dominant genre trend once people grow tired of Shounen (they did it once, they'll do it again).

Nobody can predict the future with 100% accuracy so no such thing as a bad answer here.",Salty145,587,242,0.8
163,Question about s1-ep8 of Durarara!!,11sijuq,"Question about s1-ep8.

In the first episode, we saw people kinda freaking out seeing Celty on her bike as ""Headless Rider"" and were trying to take pictures of her on her bike.

But now in the 8th episode, she's been roaming in the city and no one seems to recognise that its the same headless rider, she is standing in the middle of the city where people ARE passing by without noticing the person they've been seeing is literally in news as wanted (?).

Even the blond hair girl who is like asking people what are they finding has met Celty and Celty wrote her ""Head"" in her notebook and blond girl can't recognise that she can be the Headless Rider?

I really wonder if its going to be cleared up in next episodes so lmk if it is, or if it was cleared up in previous episodes and im missing something then please explain.

It's just the same shit happening for 50 episodes over and over again. I understood how other people find it relaxing but I'd rather watch an isekai. However, Haibane Renmei often gets brought up alongside Texhnolyze and Lain, and the latter two were really engaging and dense shows.

Tomo, Onimai, Tensai-Oujo magic thingie

I'm really enjoying Onimai and Tomo but Tensei oujo lost my interest in last couple eps. Also planning to watch Tsurune because of KyoAni.

From past seasons I've watched things like Do It Yourself, Odd Taxi and Summertime Render, anime that not many people talk about but are actually hidden gem, and enjoyed them a lot.

I'm wondering if there are any other anime that I'm missing from this season.

I've watched more than half of Vinland Saga and it didn't appeal to me so I'm not really interested in second season unless it shifts the tone.

I've watched 3 eps from third season of Danmachi and as everyone else it was mediocre and didn't continue.

It's been so long since I watched Bungou Stray Dogs I almost completely forgot what was going on and I think I didn't even watch third season.

176,Is the beach playboy archetype real?,11s0xl7,"For a long time and especially in romance genres I see the same thing happen, a shady guy or group of guys looking fashionable approach a girl and ask a variant of ""Wanna spend some time with us?"" and it's portrayed as intimidating or even downright aggressive. 

I mention the beach as that's the easiest way I have of pointing them out but they show up in stations, roads, wherever the female lead happens to go along without some form of supervision or after a fight with the MC.

Jigokuraku's art looks nice but I no longer get excited for anything remotely close to Shonen until I am at least 4 episodes in. It's also not what I'm really craving.

I guess having Deca-dence, Nomad, and Lycoris Fucking Recoil in consecutive years has left me spoiled and I want to know if there's a promising anime that will have a neatly packed story so that I know I will get a conclusion of some sort at the end of the run. Yes, I know Lycoris will continue but that's only because of its success, it mostly tied up all of its threads.

183,The Fruit of Evolution Season 2,11sfzv3,"I just have a quick question or two about The Fruit of Evolution Season 2 so any help would be appreciated. I don't care about spoilers either, for me it doesn't ruin anything and sometimes it helps my anticipation for the anime because with all the anime delays I started watching anime that's already finished or is on its final season. This anime though hits in my soft spot, I'm kind of a sucker when it comes to isekai lol. Lately I've been branching out more and watching anime from different genres or anime that are a little older so slowly but surely my anime knowledge is growing every day. Anyways I'll get to my question.

All I want to know is who the hell is Destra? I know she is a student at Barbador Magic Academy but it literally says nothing on her info page. So basically I just want to know if she will be a friend or a foe? Also what the heck happened to Saria? In the promo she looked badly injured but I'm guessing that's what was needed to unlock Seiichi's next level of badassness* ( *my own word ) and he heals her and goes on to defeat Destra who then falls in love with Seiichi because he is the first and only man to ever defeat her. I can totally see it going in that direction. 

Also I would like to know how his former classmates react when they finally meet up with him again? I bet the kids that used to bully him don't believe him at first and once they realize it's him they start to say rude shit and also try and see why so many sexy waifus are following him around and then the bullies try to convince the girls to leave Seiichi and join their group but to everyones surprise they all say that they're Seiichis wives lmao. 

Also I can see Karen joining Seiichi's harem too eventually.

So I'd really appreciate it if anyone can answer my questions, I really don't care about spoilers, all I want is to know the answers to my questions please.the",zombiepickle420,1,0,0.43

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

First comment of the day goes to /u/No_Rex

> Before I get to episode 9, a belated answer to the QoTD about magic yesterday. The answer about what type of magic system the show uses has a straight forward answer (that was already given by several people who responded yesterday): It works with an about as pure as they can get soft magic system.

> The interesting part is how well this fits the plot and theme of the show. Soft magic systems are especially weak when they are used as problem solvers (because the lack of rules leads to deus-ex-machina) or when there is interpersonal conflict (because the winner is decided by the writer’s whim, not something the reader can predict). If you look back at the episodes so far, you’ll see that magic is rarely used for either. In the heavy episodes 3&4, Elaina takes the non-hero approach of not intervening. She deliberately does not solve the obviously problematic injustices via magic. We also see very little fighting via magic (and when we do, the victor is clearly telegraphed).

> Instead a lot of the magic use goes into the advantages of soft magic: A sense of wonder and exploration. Animated-hair-stealing-dolls are a perfect example of a magic use that is almost pure fluff, not a serious problem. This sense of wonder ties in perfectly with the overall theme of the show: Elaina travelling around and soaking in the wonderful (or sometimes not so wonderful) world around her.

> Up until now, my evaluation of the show is higher that its objective criteria would suggest (I think the pacing is messed up, and the characters are a mixed bag) and I think the extremely fitting use of soft magic as a setup is a main reason why the downsides do not weigh too hard for me.

Second comment of the day goes to /u/polaristar

> I won't go into too much nitpicking of the flaws, I feel others have already pointed out the plotholes and how it went over the top on the gore and shock value.

> The tragedy of this story is sadly not the child, because I find it odd how we see the child is just a victim that went mad because she was sexually abused by the Uncle, but then when it turns out it was the Father she is framed as a cartoonishly evil villain.

> I disagree with this approach but I think I can offer a Devil's Advocate reason why that is. The whole point of this mission was so Estelle could feel better about herself even though pragmatically it'd solve nothing even if she succeeded. Elaina was having trouble bringing herself to fight back against this girl, but Estelle did so with a vengeance, slowly and brutally because she was mad that she was wrong, that that girl was never really her friend a long time ago, that this grand narrative she built in her mind was a sham. That she wasted her life on this. This was never about saving Serena this was about appeasing her own guilt and Ego.

> That fact she literally threw away a huge chunk of her life (Her Memories) For this is both sad and pathetic.

> Elaina doesn't even take her payment, it would feel tainted.

> I don't think Elaina is truly as cold and uncaring in her pragmatism as she appears, I think it's particularly a defense mechanism, she choosing not to care, be invested, or get engaged, because once she does she can't easily pull out of it. I think in actuality Elaina cares a lot more then she lets on, and she chooses not to because every time she sleeps and tries to be a Hero she's forced to just watch her inevitable impotence.

> Also I disagree with last weeks and this weeks comments, Magic system in Elaina I think is pretty shit.

> BUT POLARISTAR IT'S A SOFT MAGIC SYSTEM IT'S NOT SUPPOSE TO BE SOME UBER RATIONAL LOGIC PROGRAMMING STUFF OR ALTERNATIVE LAWS OF PHYSICS BUT ADD WONDER AND WHIMSY TO THE WORLD!!!

> Except it doesn't the magic feels very cheap, gimmicky, and doesn't even have an intuitive dream like quality to it, it feels like gaudy special effects with the most shallow rule of cool completely failing to integrate it into the worldbuilding itself.

Last comment of the day goes to /u/thatguywithawatch

> I'm gonna be hard on this episode. Not because I think it was bad (I don't), but because it deserved to be better. The unpredictable, changing tone from week to week is one of the reasons why I liked the show when it first aired, and I think having a traumatic and disturbing episode out of the blue like this would have added to the overall quality of the show immensely if it had stuck the landing. But instead it just felt like a wasted opportunity.

> So most of episode 9 is a setup for the twist reveal that, surprise! the little girl was the murderer the whole time, before shocking the audience with the sort of violence and horror that has only been occasionally hinted at before, like in episode 4. But here's where the first problem comes up: The entire payoff hinges on us believing that a tiny, maybe ~10 year old human girl with a knife was able to overpower and kill/incapacitate three grown adults at once, one of whom was a full grown witch who was presumably channeling Elaina's magic to fight her. Like, wtf was Estella doing? Unless Selena managed to go full Skyrim 100 Sneak on them and take them out unnoticed one at a time with silent backstabs, I don't see how the scene Elaina walked into could possibly have come about.

> I might be being way too critical about that one point, but once any sense of believability was removed from the situation for me, the rest of the scene just became blood and gore for the sake of having blood and gore. Additionally, Selena turned into an apparently nearly-invulnerable super strong devil for no explainable reason other than letting her death get dragged out for maximum squeamishness.

> It's a shame, because the first half of the episode had a lot of really good moments and setup. Elaina's cheerful bitchiness after she took mild offense at Estella's comment about her age was hilarious. Or the way Selena's dad casually made that weird comment about Estella's nape, foreshadowing the fact that he's a sexual abuser (admittedly a little heavy handed, but still). Also, I thought the time travel concept was handled in a decent way, both by showing that it's impractically difficult to travel back even for short periods of time, and also clarifying that they wouldn't even be changing anything in their current present, simply creating a new timeline for Estella's peace of mind.

> I have not yet read the books, so maybe they were just following the source material 100% faithfully. But, I think it wouldn't have taken much tweaking to turn this episode into something genuinely compelling and disturbing rather than just shocking and unexpected. First, hint at some believable way that Selena could have overpowered two adults and a witch all by herself; Hell, maybe all it would take would be to show that Selena could secretly use magic. Then, tone down Selena's gleeful insane psycopath act; she's an abused, angry, twisted kid in a horrific and awful situation who finally snapped. That's plenty disturbing and upsetting on its own without cheapening the entire scene by having her act like a maniacal serial killer from a popcorn horror flick. Finally, Estella killing Selena should have been quick, brutally unexpected, and tragic. Having it be so drawn out and over the top felt both unrealistic (again, Selena's supposedly just a regular human girl), and excessive for the wrong reasons.

> Maybe I'm being way too nitpicky, and I'm curious to see what the general consensus is in the comments today, but I'm just bummed out because they were clearly trying to make something unexpectedly disturbing, troubling, and completely different from every episode that came before, which is an endeavor that should be applauded if done well, and they were really close to doing it well, but then it derailed in the climax when it heavily prioritized violent shock value and silly horror-anime type schlock over any sort of believable writing. If the only goal of the episode was to make me wince at what was being visibly shown on screen, then it succeeded, but that's not an achievement in and of itself if it's not backed by compelling writing and realistic character actions.

> Elaina being stripped of her typical indifferent, unfazed attitude and sobbing in horror before the end credits deserved to be a much more impactful moment, and it would have been if it came at the end of a better episode.

>Meiling will always be one of the best anime-original added content to the series. I'm still sad that CLAMP never turned her into an official character in the manga. [CLAMP even drew her in the style of the manga](https://i.imgur.com/GZvDOJH.png) which was a massive tease back then. 

/u/JustAnswerAQuestion [shows just how long this anime has had fans](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11pss8z/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_arc_1_seasons/jbzkvd4/):

186,Yaoi/Yuri romance anime with unique premises?,11rq6mn,"Because I just realized that those Romance anime with unique premises like Komi-San (girl is SUPER introverted that it's the anime's main gag/joke) and Kaguya-Sama (couple turns confessing their love into a tactical mindgame) are mostly about straight relationships

Yaoi/Yuri Romance anime are usually kinda... vanilla? Maybe that's the wrong way to describe it. I just mean that they don't really rely on unique premises to attract viewers. These anime are just kinda presented as ""Hey, look! Another Yaoi/Yuri Romance! But with a different couple this time! Which, by default, automatically means it's different from other Yaoi/Yuri anime beyond the 'Two people meet and fall in love' premise since different people react to situations differently!""

The one Yaoi anime I can think of with a unique twist is Sasaki and Miyano, where the guy in the couple with the ""shy and meek"" archetype is a fan of Yaoi manga, which is very meta lol",SuperAlloyBerserker,43,6,0.57

I've watched anime since I was a kid, I kind of drifted away from it in my 20's with other stuff taking my time but once I had kids I enjoyed watching it again with my 2 boys. We enjoyed stuff you'd expect with boys, lots of action and adventure genres.

And then last week I just happened to try watching a romcom called ""teasing master takagi-san"", on a punt with my boys to see if it was entertaining. Never been something I was interested in before.

Holy sh\*t it hit me in a spot I didn't know I even had. The witty banter and interplay between the 2 main characters, the awkwardness in the young boy much of which I could relate to at the same age and I can see much of the same traits in one of my own boys. His clueless nature vs Takagi who knows exactly what she wants.

I'm stunned how into this anime I am, I don't think my kids really get it on the same level I do but they also love it. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",Current-Rub9309,4,4,0.75

14,86 (eighty-six) question: who is the Legion?,11ahnop,"Im just trying to get better context on the enemies of the Republic. I am on like episode 5ish. I know now something about the Legion being able to harvest human brain to form some kind of robot sentience. I don’t really understand who they are, where they came from, and their goal. Im also interested in their ranking system because they said some things about shephards. Im assuming that the brother of Shin is part of the legion in some way. Can anyone clarify my questions without giving too many spoilers past what I know?

Edit:

Okay most comments are saying to watch it and my questions will most likely get answered.

I think that other companies should do the same with their own back catalogues, for example I would like Toei re-realeasing shows like Magical Doremi, Zatch Bell, Older Digimon, Kitaro and PreCure animes, Ayakashi CJH, etc. or why stop with shows that had official dubbed realeases, even if it would require a more work, maybe realease things that weren't dubbed in English (To my knowledge) like Captain Herlock, Hokuto no Ken, Candy Candy, Ginga Nagareboshi Gin, Ghost Sweeper Mikami, Kindaichi Case Files, etc.?

I don't know how hard that would be but wouldn't it be great to just make these shows easily accessible? I don't think most people would care for a lot of these, yes, but that's kinda the point, of course a lot of these wouldn't give Toei much money from the English market, but they could give more hardcore Anime fans a treat while they center their profit on their cash cows like DBZ, Saint Seiya, Newer Digimon, Kitaro and PreCure animes, Sailor Moon and One Piece aswell as any other new show they got. And yes, there's already enough streaming services, they could also dump those shows on Amazon and Hulu aswell as Youtube like TMS does too if they want the extra profit, I don't want another streaming service.

30,How did you stumble upon what is now your favourite anime of all time?,11aboww,"I think this is more of a ""story time"" discussion post

for me it was and still is Fate and Re:Zero.

I remember knowing 0 about the series when I first got into the sphere. I only ever started hearing about it from Gigguk's Fate fandom in a nutshell video. I started trying to figure out how exactly I wanted to go about watching the series. NO CAP, I spent a week trying to find out what was the most optimal way of starting the series. And don't tell me I wasted my time cause that week of just researching was some of the most fun I've had outside of actually watching the anime itself. In the end, I ended up with this really long list and just binged everything... now I keep up with almost all the franchise and over a couple years later, I still haven't watched/played/read everything... THE RABBIT HOLE GOES DEEP!

Re:Zero is a lot less fun, but in a way, that's what makes it so memorable for me. I was just looking for a random anime to watch after Toradora made me realise Anime was more than just people fighting, I popped on Re:Zero without knowing ANYTHING. So the entire concept of RBD, the Rem and Emilia waifu war thing, the whole controversy wtih Subaru as a protagonist I knew nothing about. I just decided to watch it for no reason beyond it being one of the recommendations and BOOM! I have yet to have found one linear storyline that captivated me more than Re:Zero.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 

/u/Great_Mr_L 
> Rin breastfeeding with Mimi’ breasts was a strange scene, but I think I understand what it was going for. Rin is searching for the warmth and comfort she felt from her mother. She wants that feeling of reassurance that everything is going to be okay. Rin wants someone to be around who can take care of her so she won’t have to push herself so hard.

It's the last day, so I've given multiple choices today. Haaave fuuun~

Tomorrow's episode is going to be      
*""Nothing, cause you watched it all!!""*      
I hope you're all excited for our series discussion!! Btw, if anyone has any content. Galleries, comment collections, homemade fanart that they'd like to share then please at me and I'll include them all in the thread body tomorrow!!

39,call of the night is...interesting,11a9ica,"I was recommended this anime and I said why not cause it seemed cool. It has a really cool premise so far and I like the idea. The only thing I hate is the main characters age. It makes me so physically uncomfortable seeing a 14 year old in these situations that have very obvious sexual undertones. If he was 18 or even 17 I'd probably be okay with it but 14?? That's so young, barely in highschool.

I was looking online to see if there were any similar opinions but I've seen nothing but praise. Am I the only one uncomfortable from this? I know there's no explicit romance or sexual scenes (from what I've heard/scene) but it's still so....weird. Please don't bash me I'm just sharing my thoughts. To be honest I don't think I'll continue the anime if it keeps going in this direction.

Edit: ...I'm gonna go watch ghost stories for the 15th time 😅",milkytoasty1,61,0,0.34
40,Need help finding anime/animation based on description,11a8v0l,"I’m not sure if this is the right place for this kind of post, but I recall seeing this one anime scene or animation where a little girl screamed(or breathed?) And a bunch of cool effects appear. Said clip was viewed on YouTube around 2 years ago and was very high quality and aesthetically pleasing. This wasn’t a clip that gave off serious or badass vibes. Rather, a more slice of life and wholesome mood.

42,A anime you enjoyed that you thought you wouldnt like and a popular animie that you didnt enjoy?,11a8e2m,I didnt think id like tokyo ghoul going off of what ive heard i thought it would just be too dark and depressing but it turned out to be one of my favorites and a couple popular ones i couldnt get into were black buttler and attack on titian. Idk if there just slow starters but but i just wasnt enjoying them so stoped after the second or thired episode.,Zenkrome,20,0,0.6

45,What would Aizen sosuke be in a kpop group or boys band,11a7lm6,"I've always wondered what such an amazing character could be in a kpop group or boys band. Would he be a leader, a rapper, a vocalist, a dancer. One thing I'm sure about us that he'll surely be a visual. He definitely has it. Or maybe he'll the mistreated member of the group ? 

I personally see him ass a visual or a rapper and a vocalist, but I don't see him as a dancer. However it's Aizen we're talking about. So he would probably do his best to excel at everything, so I think he might be an ace too.

Do consider the fact that he's a human in this, so no powers no tricks, just his natural charisma, elegant demeanor, his intelligence and his beauty.",Quirky-Ordinary-8564,2,0,0.29
46,Anime that will make me cry?,11a7a5o,"I’m a dude whose secret is that I’m a huge sucker for soppy tear jerker anime, particularly romance focused. I’m looking for some recommendations. Some recent examples that made me cry (on the inside, much too manly to actually physically manifest tears):

Re:Zero

Your name

A silent voice

Plenty more that I can’t remember off the top of my head right now, I’m particularly interested in ones that focus on loneliness and social isolation but eventually finding romance (I’ve probably seen the obvious ones here but you never know).

Thanks!",SpaceToad,48,4,0.65
47,What is this anime called?,11a746z,"All I remember from the clip I saw on YouTube years back was that it’s extremely beautiful, week animated and the animation is great. I think it’s dark and I directly remember there’s a girl with long elf ears. There could possibly be a bunch of people like her I do not think they are actually elves. Maybe they have special kinds of power in this anime. I haven’t watched “violet evergarden” but the animation and art style seems a bit similar or I could be completely wrong.

69,Uplifting/inspiring anime with ost like the examples below,11a0a1j,"Kakegurui-Pure uplifting madness through the eyes of Jabami Yumeko, on first watch you could say she is just a gambling addict, but its about so much more. Yumeko is salvation/truth incarnate in that school, anyone who gambles with her somehow realizes their true desires/their true self. 

ost examples:

Princess Tutu-Just finished watching, its a masterpiece. Story driven and inspired by Swan lake, any fantasy story like this could work for me

70,Why did the girls take such extreme measures in school days?,11a01mo,"I just finished school days. It's the most disgusting thing I have watched. Every part of me regrets watching that.

Still, I'm curious about why did the girls take such extreme measures? Normally, people don't kill their partners no matter how scum they are. Only people with mental issues do that.

Both girls, especially kotonoha seemed to have issues from the start. I knew something was off with her. But I didn't see it coming in Sekai's case.

What do you think about this the girls being mentally fucked up before they met him? Is there anything canon about them (like in the manga or something)?

If not, what do you think?",Gold_Assistance_647,16,0,0.27
71,trying to find this anime,119zl9b,So i have been trying to find this anime i used to watch with my brother but we both don't remember the name of it all i remember from it was that a little plastic ball would be thrown and the ball would turn into some mini plastic version of the monster and it would turn into the monster if ya'll think you know this anime pls tell me thank you.,Unfair-Revenue-3186,3,1,0.67
72,Which one should I watch next?,119zl01,"Which anime should I start from these?
- natsume’s book of friends 
- your lie in April
- death parade 
- odd taxi
- my roommate is a cat 
- march comes like a lion 
- summer time rendering
- maid sama

73,I wish more anime were like Wonder Egg Priority...,119zj3k,"This isn't a recommendation request mods. Yes I tagged it right.

I've been thinking about WEP for a while now and thinking about how quickly it shit the bed and became the poster child for production hell. I know the series gets a lot of shit and by no means should it be praised for where things went... but I wish more anime ended up like this. Here me out.

Wonder Egg crashed as hard as it did because it dared have ambition and flew to close to the sun. It overburdened its talent on the production side and lost sight of its direction on the writing side, but at least it had the audacity to try. I'm tired of a medium that seems to endlessly peddle mediocrity. For every once in a life time year we get like 2021, we get a 2022 or Winter 2023 where artistic expression seems to take back seat to merely satisfying the content machine with whatever we have left to adapt. I'm tired of seasons full of boilerplate romcoms, isekai, and action affairs that will be quickly forgotten once they end. 

I will always take a 4/10 that was ambitious and failed than a 6/10 that did nothing new and was merely ""enjoyable"". I know this medium can do better, and I know we as a community are deserving of better. The ""content machine"" can't continue forever, nor should we be required to continue participating in it.

We can't keep going down this path. There has to be a better way.

But what do y'all think? Am I just crazy for thinking this?",Salty145,20,0,0.41

86,Fantasy logistics like Campfire Cooking in Another World but less OP?,119ta85,"Hello folks. I started watching Campfire Cooking in Another World, and while it really did not work out for me, I'm looking for something to scratch that itch.

What I liked about it:    
-focusing on happiness that something (food, cooking) brings    
-potential for having a main character whose strength is being more The Logistics Guy as opposed to the Action Hero. I guess the only other similar examples that come to mind right now are manga like Jun (time-travel with a doctor), Chef of Nobunaga (timetravel with...a chef), and...I guess How to Treat Magical Beasts (fantasy vet)    
-no obvious fanservice or weird sex stuff (at least to the point I watched).    
-it was pretty lighthearted. Which doesn't mean I would discount less cheesy options by any means, but I really wouldn't want to go for something rough and gritty and tragic    
    
What I didn't like:    
-from my perspective, I lost a sense of the character being challenged or in any way vulnerable by episode 3, and that only seemed to get more extreme afterwards.    
-questionable moral choices like ambiguous [Campfire cooking in another world] >!cannibalism!< and mild [Campfire cooking in another world] >!genocide!< . Which, they could still make sense in the context of the world, but the tonal dissonance personally left my ears ringing    
-related to the two issues above, the character felt like he had no initiative after episode 1    
    
If you liked Campfire, please don't take this as a jab. It has good parts, but didn't work for me.

Another I can think of is near the end of the show, the main character and the female interest got separated from the rest, no way to get through the monsters, lost all hope and went to the old world city, hid from the monsters till they were found.",The1naruto,4,0,0.5

But honestly I don't get it at all, sure the animation is a little hard to get used to but after 2 episodes you'll get used to it and enjoy it just like other Animes.

apart from where to watch them, I would really appreciate some recommendations for romance/thriller or maybe even action. Just looking for some good plot! 

thank you!",winniedidnotpooh,3,0,0.4
92,Has anime ever changed your life,119r1bs,"I'm very new here so pls forgive me if I do anything wrong. 

When it comes to anime, I've always been a simple story kind of guy. Dragon Ball and Naruto are still placed firmly in my top 5 anime off all time; but that's just it. The more anime I watch and expose myself to the more my All Time Favorites list shifts. If you told me this time last year that Goku and the gang would be fighting to hold on to my personal #1 all time spot id assume you just haven't actually met me. The first anime that started my new wave of thinking was Akame ga Kill!. seeing an anime end in such a fashion shook my very core of what story telling in anime could be. Code Gease redefined what a protagonist could be. Then Cowboy bebop shows me that stories of space travel don't always have to involve super-powered aliens to be entertaining. but then it happened - I watched something that would change my life... No, the way I view consciousness itself. I had two big rules when it came to anime i'd watch: No (Super insane) sexualization of characters under 18, and NO mechs (don't ask why I hated mech anime) I finally swallowed my pride and watch the goat of all goat animes, the one so unanimously praised, it's almost synonymous with the genre of japanese animation itself. I finally watched Neon Genesis Evangelion (and not to sound like im 14 and this is deep) but it truly changed my outlook on life at the age of 21. I'd had 20.9 years prior to form who I was, but the last 4 episodes of an Anime from the late 90s changed me more than most of what i'd been through up until that point

I have made a minor change to the schedule, after completing my own personal rewatch I have decided to slot in OVA 1 after Episode 13, instead of at the season break as originally announced. I was on the fence about this before starting, but I do think the story flows best this way.

The rewatch will begin in one week, March 1st at 6:00pm PST!

The part that sucks is that almost every single one of their featured animes is a netflix original. I’ll see something that looks good, not realize it’s by netflix, and then finally figure it out after 10 mins when there’s some underage girl being exploited.

I know the answer is to just ditch netflix, but i can’t afford another streaming service at the moment. I get netflix for free because it’s paid for by the head of household. So, are there any anime’s on netflix that DONT fucking do this? Any netflix originals I don’t have to avoid?

It should have been so nice if the story ended with the female MC born again as the child of the MC or smth.

**[THE CHANGE](https://imgur.com/a/SN3YeXD)**

Change of heart. Waste.

**Playing Card when Substituted:** Ace of Clubs

**Card’s Message:**

Lack of concentration. You are envious of others and view things and goals in this negative way of thinking. This disturbing mood makes you do useless shopping.

**Card’s Warning:**

A change for oneself will result in refreshment. It would be good if you tried playing sports or redecorating your room.

I remember that after watching this entire anime (and reading the manga), I didn't blink an eye at all the loli fanservice in Eromanga Sensei anime: ""But why are complaining about loli fanservice here? This anime looks so wholesome to me!"" Rin-chan completely *warped* my tolerance! Now almost all other anime seems so pure! Damn brat! :)""*

Not so long ago, western fans didn't have the same level of access to premieres and broadcasts that they do now so we had to take what we can get.  Usually, dub was the first thing we saw so that was what became ingrained in our minds when it came to how characters spoke and acted.  But now, thanks to the continual evolution of the internet, we can get streaming episodes on the day they premiere so now, the sub version has become the new standard.",cjnshrmpoby,10,0,0.13

Along the way, we give an explainer on the basic concepts in Nen and highlight the plot points and themes that drive each section of the narrative.

138,"Am I crazy, or did Onimai reference Hitchcock? (Spoilers for Onimai ep 1 and North by Northwest)",1195p4z,"I watched the first episode of the show, and while I immediately dropped it (just not my kinda show), there was a strange detail I noticed that’s been bothering me ever since. Near the end of the episode, the protagonist (who has been transformed into a girl) questions if this new body might be a change for the better. She can turn back into a guy if she wants, but she hesitates, realizing she has a chance to turn her life around and embrace a new side of herself. She ponders this while standing under an overpass.

As she leans more towards staying as a girl, a train goes across the overpass and away from the protagonist. If you know about the famous scene from North by Northwest, you may realize where I’m going with this by now.

Alfred Hitchcock, the renowned filmmaker responsible for films like Psycho and Vertigo, worked during a time where Hollywood censorship was at an extreme. A draconian set of rules and regulations known as the Hays Code dictated what most films were able to portray when it came to material like violence and sexual content. Hitchcock, who primarily made adult thrillers with a good amount of both, was infamous for finding all sorts of ways to dodge the Hays Code. For example, one part of the code dictated a kiss between two characters could only last so many seconds, and Hitchcock found a loophole by having the characters kiss just under the maximum amount, break the kiss, and then kiss again.

In the film North by Northest, a spy thriller/parody, the ending has the protagonist and his love interest escape on a train, having just saved the day. They’re very clearly about to bang, but the Hays Code completely prohibited any form of sexual interactions on screen. So Hitchcock instead filmed a shot of the train passing through a tunnel, something he himself admitted was a visual metaphor for the protagonist sticking his…well, you get the idea. This became an iconic film scene, both because of the humor of the visual and because of how well it represented filmmakers creatively working around censorship.

Now let’s return to Onimai. The protagonist, who was originally a man, questions if she should keep her female body. And as she does, *a train drives away.* Implying her “train” has left the station, so to speak. It’s also worth noting that this isn’t in the manga; in the manga, she simply questions if she should keep her new body without any trains passing by.

So this leads me back to the title. Am I just looking way too into this, or did Studio Bind actually reference Alfred fucking Hitchcock in their dumb comedy fanservice anime? I’m legit going crazy over this, and I need to find out whether I’m just imagining things or not.",GuiltyAs_Charged,6,4,0.6

142,what is your best top 5 anime Opening and Ending song of all time?,1194q6f," i really love the complexity of multiple instrument blending together. for opening ofc it gotta be hype up :  
1 : [ACCA13 OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pITNm95Sd1k) undefeated to this day for me. the song is a complex mix of jazz, pop, hiphop, and the layer of multiple instument make this song nearly impossible to do band cover.  
2 : [Guilty Crown OP 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv4znGv6lzg) actually tied for first place for me, it just diffrent style of song. similar to the first one with the mix of Classical instrument with techno is really hard to do, most of the time it would just sound like a mess. and i just love the Piano in the background and Violin shredding hard the entire song (it was Guilty crown OP1+2 that set the whole bar for anime op back in the day and what got me into anime song culture)  
3: [Psycho-Pass OP 1](https://youtu.be/WWBDuVCuiUQ) best Blues rock anime op song of all time for me. the unique whispering voice and the guitar that start of like a light blues turn into full punk rock is so good, way too underated song from TK. i think is better than Tokyo Ghould Unravel in my opinion.  
4 : [Eureka Seven AO OP2](https://youtu.be/RJJ7w8JuFvc)  similar to Eureka Seven very first OP from the same band FLOW so it's a little nostalgic bias a little bit for me. but lead singer really have handsome voice  
5 : [Fire Force S2 OP1](https://youtu.be/yKJ04FMGJeM) Aimer is a really good singer and her range of voice it's just amazing  


i mostly like beautiful sad song when its an ending song :   


1 : [After the Rain ED](https://youtu.be/A3UJMHp7Q-E?t=2)  Aimer just pour her soul into this song  
2 : [Kyoukai no Katana ED](https://youtu.be/RT0FEFcT54g) really good song and singer voice is amazing  
3 : [Gakusen Toshi Asterisk ED](https://youtu.be/uqolVXp5XLA) underated hidden gem of an ED song  
4 : [Natsuyuki rendevouse ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP3hNCrZlk8)  just... amazingly beautiful song by Aimer. and very touching Lyric  
5 : [Summertime Render ED2](https://youtu.be/qWPTZXPC6RM)  same as number 4. played at the last episode was just the best

Bonus :  [JOJO Part 6 ED](https://youtu.be/ejRgi6YAh54) when it play the the very last episode of JOJO trilogy it just bring me tears. RIP to other people that didn't make throughout these hard trying time the past few years to witness the end of Jostar Trilogy. \*salute\*",KlMOCHl,10,0,0.52

158,Who started the genre of Fantasy Magical Tower? Also which was 1st with its own worlds for floors?,118zgot,"Here are my 2 questions.

**I)** So climbing Magical Towers with fantasy backdrop is a very popular genre in  Anime and Manga/Manhwa, from what I know the very first was **'The Tower of Druaga', 1984 video-game**  which spawned this genre which inspired the Towers in Ys and so on and also directly or indirectly inspired some Mangas and eventually became a very common setting in Manhwas and also mobile games.

The Tower of Druaga also received an anime in 2008 with 2 seasons.

The Tower of Druaga is more of a Dungeon crawl of Dungeons and Dragons etc in a vertical setup. And if you want to argue the dungeon crawl has its roots in the Greek's Minotaur Labyrinth.

*So I wanted to know whether Tower aspect of Tower of Druaga was inspired by anything that came before it?*

**II)** **My 2nd question is who started the setting where each Floor in Magical Towers have their own unique Worlds** which may or may not be constantly repeating for each climber(Players/Hunters/Adventurers whatever you want to name them) attempting them. But whether it is an entire universe is generally glossed over by the authors.

Generally in Tower setting with repeating worlds the actions and decisions made by climbers are essentially insignificant as the world will be reset back to initial state. These worlds are basically slice or magical photograph of a world setting in different universe captured inside an crystal ball.  Each climber can recruit the same person from that world if he/she chooses to. Example: The Tutorial is too hard.

In some Tower setting, each floor either hosts unique environments while some have its own thriving world. Example: Tower of God, Solo Max-level Newbie.",Tiger-Chief,6,4,0.69
159,Is it possible to watch word-for-word English subtitles in any Japanese work?,118ypnp,"One of the primary difficulties I’ve found with “learning through anime” is the difference in the subject verb agreement which forces you to mentally re-arrange the Japanese words to fit the English subtitles you already took the time to read. If you hear a character say “電車で学校に行きます” and didn’t know what any of the words meant, you’d have to some mental work connecting it to the subtitles “I go to school by train.” Instead, does there exist a way to display English subtitles in the exact order of the Japanese words, that example being: “Train by school to (I) go?” The sentence may make no sense in English, but in the same way that kids learn to talk with Yoda’s subject-verb agreement just by listening to him use it in English, I’d imagine that these subtitles would make learning the words and phrases much easier.",Largicharg,22,0,0.25

161,Help me find old anime/animated movie,118xc3t,"So, I remember this scene from a movie i watched as a child. I think i’ve seen this movie multiple times, during mid 90s.

Their skin was entirely covered by big rocks and they were very old. I think, the protagonist tried to talk with one, but something scared them away. They were controlled/punished by someone with some underwater echoes. The movie was dubbed so i don’t know if it’s Japanese, Chinese or American. I always thought this scene was part of a Chinese anime film i used to watch as a kid “Prince Nezha's Triumph Against Dragon King (1979)”, but i checked it recently and it wasn’t.

168,KIMI NI TODOKE: MY OPINION AND FINAL RATING,118vkek,"Fine, so I started watching Kimi Ni Todoke recently, already completed S1, which ended on a good note. But then all of a sudden things changed when I started S2.. Ahh ok ok, let me give you guys a brief summary of the anime first (for those who never touched the anime). 

So it's your typical high-school romance anime from 2009-10, where we have an apparently ""scary"" lady called Sawako (scary because of her appearance), who had a bad reputation for scaring people and was even rumored to be able to summon ghosts. She encounters Kazehaya, who was the popular guy in his middle school and used to play baseball there. While Sawako feels that that encounter changed her life, for Kazehaya that encounter was something special.

Now for the fact why the encounter was life-changing for her. She was able to make her first friends Ayane and Chizuru, one a playgirl and the other a delinquent. Due to a seating change, our main casts come together, dragging along another baseball player and Chizuru's childhood friend, Ryu. 

But then someone started spreading rumors about Ayane and Chizuru and accused Sawako to be spreading them. Things get worse when Ayane and Chizuru overhears that they were ""not"" Sawako's friends and also when they confronted Sawako on whether she liked them or not, she said she ""didn't like"" them. 

Well eventually the rumor issue was solved but it was unknown who spread them. At this juncture, Kurumi entered and proved herself to be a ""nasty plotter"". She took advantage of Sawako and told her that she loved Kazehaya since middle school. She was the one who made the pact that ""Kazehaya was everyone's guy"", so that no girl would try getting in her way of confessing to him. 

It was the athletic festival soon, and Kurumi kept on dragging Sawako away from Kazehaya by telling her to talk to Ryu more often, since he saved her from being hit by a curve ball during pre-match practice. Kurumi insisted her to thank Ryu for saving her, and wrote a fake letter to him so that he would go meet Sawako. She ambushed Kazehaya during his committee duty and took him to the place where Ryu and Sawako were talking. 

However, the plan backfired on her since Kazehaya went and dragged Sawako away and Ryu left too, leaving Kurumi alone, but there came Pin (the funniest name for a homeroom teacher lol) and he misunderstood that Kurumi had feelings for him. At this point, Kazehaya came back after confronting Sawako yet again, saw them together and thought that Kurumi loves Pin. This was enough to destroy her. 

Very soon Ayane and Chizuru confronted Kurumi and at the same time Sawako came too and got to know the truth: Kurumi spread those rumors. However, the blondie plotter wasn't punished, instead she was sympathized. And soon Kurumi arc was over, with Kurumi and Sawako being love rivals now. 

I liked the Year-end arc and that was the time when they, I mean Sawako and Kazehaya were supposed to bond with each other very strongly.

But Valentine's Day came soon and things became awkward for both Sawako and Kazehaya. What I felt bad was that Sawako was not able to give her chocolate to him thanks to that nasty plotter. I hate Kurumi now! An absolute reason why I should drop the anime completely. 

So overall I'm giving the anime 6/10, just because the second season felt too awful for me.

Does it have an actual name?

Why do animes use the second face instead of the first one?

Is there any examples of people using or at least making the face in real life? I've only seen it in anime",Que7i,10,1,0.5

 March Comes in Like A Lion & chihayafuru please I tried searching on MAL under the sports tab but all I get are western type sports anime that bore me not to mention the massive amount of anime in that category makes it so overwhelming that it's hard to find something so this is my last resort because google was no help at all lol",Lone_Note,9,0,0.5

Does anyone know what this is?",118ookr,I watched an anime when I was younger and I can’t remember what it’s called at all only some details of it. I remember it took place in this kingdom with EXTREMELY high towers and you couldn’t really see the people on the ground in detail. There was a child princess who had no family but had some kind of royal advisors of some sort whom she trusted but they’d actually killed her mother before and enslaved all the people to work underground for some reason or another and all the people the princess had been seeing celebrating all the time on the ground were all fake wooden people being manipulated somehow. I’ve been trying to figure this out from the plot for years now and can never figure it out. If anyone knows what this is please share because it’s driving me nuts!

He mentioned that he saw a mecha anime on Cartoon Network in the mid 2000's, but we can't find it so I need everyone's hekp. All he can give us is that it started in space, the protagonist is on a ship, they get attacked and he is found to be able to pilot the mech. He said that he remembers the characters hair turning blue when he got in tune with the mech, and that he may have heard a woman's voice, or that a woman was helping him in some way. 

He also thought it was more of a movement style, not cockpit style mech, but it definitely isn't G Gundam.",Brickman3211,8,0,0.33

edit: ps, i like action and drama tho! if this anime wanders around these genres more than mecha then def going to watch it",weishenmyguy,62,0,0.32

189,Isekai anime where the main character is not the one reincarnated?,118mrj5,Interested in seeing if there is an Isekai anime where the perspective is not from the reincarnated person/people. Perhaps the reincarnated people are twisted and the main character is one of the few people who know. Or maybe the heroes were summoned by a twisted person or group who feeds misinformation to them and we follow the other side that has to fight off the heroes. Anything like that really.,Lanurus,36,4,0.65

If you watch the fight closely, you can see how calculated Yor is in her fight because she would change her fighting patterns mid-fight to land a hit on Loid and it is awesome. 

I am not sitting here saying that all anime females are weak and that there aren't any fights in anime, what I am saying is, are there any other animes out there that show a female character actually beating the crap out of enemies (or ally) without mercy. Especially if its a male, again. There are tons of female vs female beatdowns in anime, I want to see an anime female doing hand-to-hand combat and beating a male behind in the process similar to hang-to-hand to what Yor did to Loid.  

The only other anime I can think of is Annie VS Eren, but its not as exciting as Yor and Loid's fight.",Leading_Cold,6,0,0.44

Comments of the Day:

/u/TheEscapeGuy [gave this excellent analysis](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/117ne2h/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_30/j9cm6sn/):

>Based on this, I think I really like Kanbe Mamoru's work on CCS. His episodes really pull me in and are a visual treat. And since it has been 25 years, we can look at what he went on to do. Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to comment on a lot of his other work (mostly because I have not seen Elfen Lied. Anyone want to chip in on that? There's also Promised Neverland but...). However he did direct Sora no Woto which I can strongly recommend. The way it depicts devastation and warfare contrasted with the daily life of the girls is masterful. It's similar to CCS in that sense, contrasting slice-of-life with more serious plot elements.

/u/The_Loli_Otaku [revealed their innermost desires](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/117ne2h/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_30/j9clzjd/). They also said that:

>It's these little dopey animations that really make Cardcaptor such a fun show for me. It's got some real heart.

2) Are Jenius descendants forever cursed to describe themselves in the context of Max and Milia?

#Comment of the Day!! 

/u/Lolpete18 feels mellow that he hasn't gone rug munching before. 
>*""You know, in all of my years on this Earth, nobody has ever fallen into me and landed with their crotch in my face. Hahaha, these fortuitous “happy accidents” in ecchi crack me up. They can be so convoluted and sometimes just physically impossible.""*        

/u/Draco_Estella for another well written writeup! Sasuga, Draco-chan!! 
>*Rin is finally realising the meaning of growing up, and is acting more mature than previously. Her seductions are so on point it makes hair stand. Every time she pulls Aoki in it really makes the moment intense. She takes on the role of housemaker and takes care of Reiji's breakfast. She takes on the lead of the class and organises her class to finish whatever they need to do, in a way much more efficient and better than Aoki. Rin is a very well rounded girl. Though her seductions went a little too much and she flashed her whole body in front of Aoki. Time to burn down the tree.*

208,How would you rate Ichigo Kurosaki from Bleach?,118fss9,"Personally I feel like he is an ok/good main character,nothing more

He could have been more than what he is,his writing lacks in some things (no proactive enough,not showed enough of his personality) and maybe would have been better as co-protagonist,but I don't believe he is mid at all. For Bleach story,he does an acceptable job as main character 

I would rate him a solid 7,how you guys would rate him:

S (9-10/10) PEAK

A(8-9/10) GREAT

B(7-8/10) GOOD

C(6-7/10) MID (no good but no bad either,the average,can be seen as positive as well)

D(5-6/10) BELOW MID (mediocre,not totally bad,but more bad than good)

E(4-5/10) BAD

F(3-/10) TRASH

The rewatch is set to begin on **1st April** and end on **16th April**, with discussion threads going up at **9:00 pm UTC**. I plan to post reminders **1 week** and **24 hours** before we begin. If you want to be tagged and weren't here, leave a comment and I'll add you to the list!

After getting a few opinions, I've decided to include the OVAs in the series rather than put them at the end. The schedule will be:

**Date** | **Episode**

1st April | Episode 1
2nd April | Episode 2
3rd April | OVA 2 - Hell's Kitchen
4th April | Episode 3
5th April | Episode 4
6th April | OVA 1 - Stairway To Heaven
7th April | Episode 5
8th April | Episode 6
9th April | Episode 7
10th April | Episode 8
11th April | Episode 9
12th April | Episode 10
13th April | Episode 11
14th April | Episode 12
15th April | Episode 13 + Special Epilogue
16th April | Final Discussion Thread

I plan to include a few **daily questions** people can answer as discussion starters. You don't *have* to answer them (Haruhi knows *I* don't in most rewatches), but it'll be interesting to see what people say! I'd also like to include a **screenshot of the day**, so if you see anything you think MUST be highlighted then nominate it in the thread and I'll pick one out.

Feel free to say or bring up anything else you feel is relevent to the episode, too.

**Series Information**

Angel Beats! can be streamed through [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GY49PW7QR/angel-beats) (sub only) or [Funimation](https://www.funimation.com/shows/angel-beats/) (sub and dub). Neither has the OVAs or special epilogue available.

* [Male Category](https://animebracket.com/r-anime-best-male-seiyuu-of-2022/nominate)

24 hours left until the end of the nominations phase of the inaugural Best Seiyuu of the Year contest! Each seiyuu will have 2 or 3 characters tied to them, depending on how much text I can fit into one entry.

Note that only those who have roles in the previous season can be nominated. Other pointers to note:

* Family name → Given name order for consistency. Example: Sakura Ayane instead of Ayane Sakura
* If a seiyuu has already been nominated, you can submit the same one again with a different image or role, but that will be subject to approval.
* For source, insert the anime name and its respective season if it's not season 1. Example: Tensura S2 Part 2
* For link to image, insert an image link showing the seiyuu, not the character that the seiyuu voices.
* A performance from a show is valid as long as MAL says that the show premiered on Winter 2022, Spring 2022, Summer 2022, or Fall 2022. So if a show started in Dec 2022 but is considered Winter 2023 by MAL, it is invalid. Conversely, if a show started in Dec 2021 but is considered Winter 2022 by MAL, it is valid.
* Just because a role isn't tied to a seiyuu doesn't mean it's not available for contention. If a role you liked isn't displayed alongside a seiyuu's name, you can still vote for him/her. For example, I have listed Takahashi Rie as Megumin & Emilia, but if you liked her as Takagi, you can still vote for her.

It's about a girl who lives in an orphanage in the woods, which is run by nuns. I remember one episode where she and a boy gets mad at eachother, but then she remebers something about them being babies together and stealing eachothers milkbotles and dulls. Also, there is a scary episode with a ghost or something as well.. hope this rings a bell for someone

230,"Giving Anime a second chance, tips for adult audiences with mature themes and characters?",11874aq,"I'm currently giving Anime a second shot after disliking a lot of it in my teen/early 20s - Are there any suggestions for viewers who don't enjoy the heavily teenage-focussed tropes and can understand a subtle storyline without the characters overexplaining every single detail? This has always been my main problem with anime, I really don't want art to treat me like I have the media literacy of a 13 year old who has never read a book - it feels insulting in some cases  


I'm a huge fan of the souls series and loved FURI, so I started with the 2 inspirations for those:  
\- I just watched the 97 adaption of Berserk, and while it also falls into the overexplanation trap a few times, the themes, plot and characters were refreshingly mature and I loved the ending  
\- I also quite enjoyed the Afro Samurai Mini-series for the incredible artstyle and atmosphere  
\- loved Akira for obvious reasons   
\- Grave of the fireflies was incredible  


Some stuff other people had suggested, maybe you guys can give me some bonus info if these could be decent:  


Monster  
Serial Experiments Lain  
Erased

Some bonus info:

\- I heavily prefer drawn art over CGI, but I'm open for it if the writing, atmosphere and art are great  
\- Characters don't HAVE to be adults, but I would prefer mature storylines and themes over teenage/school stuff  
\- No fanservice, I don't mind sexual themes, but I can't stand the nosebleed trope/nudity just to appeal to the audience",Puzzleheaded_Knee_53,41,0,0.35

My favorite 2022 anime is cyberpunk edgerunners coz it was great in both action and romance.

My favorite 2023 anime is ice guy and his cool female colleague coz its just so wholesome (actually I'm confused b/w this and angel next door).",Gold_Assistance_647,65,17,0.69
232,A Question About High School DxD: Why do you all hate Diodora Astaroth?,1185xwc,"Look, I know you guys have many blacklists of characters in *High School DxD*. There is that female fallen angel that tricked Issei and then there is the maniacal Freed Sellzen.

But why do you guys hate Diodora Astaroth so much to the point of making every newcomer here hate him?

So what? Why should I have some reasons to hate this enemy villain?

What are the reasons as to why exactly?

Because I dealt with other villains and did not show hatred towards them:

* *Inazuma Eleven*: Kageyama Reiji, Kenzaki Ryuuichi, Garshield Bayhan
* *Star Wars*: Darth Vader, Sheev Palpatine, Darth Maul, Count Dooku, Boba Fett, Cad Bane, Admiral Thrawn
* *My Hero Academia*: All For One, Overhaul
* *Metroid*: Ridley, Sylux, Dark Samus, Raven Beak

So what are the reasons to hate this so-called ""scumbag/scuzzball""?

While we are at it, could you guys also explain to me how he became this narcissistic and sadistic and why?",Additional_Gap2510,6,0,0.17

In my opinion the MC that has it worse is Subaru (Re:Zero) since he literally has to die countless times over although even this is debatable since he ends up with Emilia and also has Rem.
Who has it best is harder but I think that it would be Cid (Eminence in Shadow) since unlike other overpowered MC who have to have some sort of terrible backstory he really doesn’t have that and automatically has practically all he ever wanted when he is reborn.

Seriously, who edited this series? There are multiple big moments that will literally come out of the blue, take up 12 seconds of an episode, and not be touched on again for multiple episodes, or ever even brought up again. Not to mention all of the random plot threads that go nowhere, or feel like they cut out 80% of the scenes needed for them to make sense.

I'll go first:

**Fate/Zero Season 2**-this season brought out what Season 1 sets up and execute it perfectly. The animation was better,the fights were well-choreographed and the ending was perfect.

**Mob Psycho 100 II**-Im only 7 episodes in but im going to confidently say that this is one of the greatest seasons in all of anime. They did what makes Season 1 great and make it even better. The Mogami fight was amazingly well-animated,the character interactions are also well-animated,every new character that was introduced has roles it being small,every episode doesn't fell boring and 99.9 is a banger of an opening.

**Vinland Saga Season 1**-This season was incredible. The plot is very engaging,the fights are very raw but exhilarating, Askeladd is such a great antagonist,side characters are great and the ending is one of the best scene in the last 6 years",Dismal-Shake-6725,25,1,0.52
255,Ouran High School Host Club opinions??,117w2eq,"Okay so like 
This seems like a stupid question 
But what do you guys like about Ouran High School Host Club??
I hear so much about it, it’s one of the most popular and classically deemed anime’s there is and has been suggested to me dozens of times 
I finally started watching it and I’m 9 episodes in and I don’t get it??
Like I’m not saying I don’t like it I just… don’t get it???
I think it’s funny (the twins are my favorite) but it lacks an overall plot and idk 
Maybe it’s just because most of the anime I’ve seen is more action or competition based but I’m not understanding what made/makes it so popular??
I’m sure a lot of it is rooted in the fact that I didn’t start watching anime until I was almost 18 and it was very taboo in my house, so my brain is very Americanized for lack of a better word 
But some of the things in it make me feel weird about watching it? Like how mitsukuni behaves for his age or the random school of girls who make a nazi reference?? 
I’m still going to finish it 
I still think it’s funny
I’m just so curious as to what makes it so popular when it seems like something that would be very controversial, especially in todays society
I know this is worded terribly and I want everyone to know that I don’t mean to sound offensive or disrespectful if I do 
I like the show 
I think it’s funny
I like a lot of the characters 
I just (for lack of a better way to explain it) don’t get it??

Back in either 1999, or 2000, at Clark College, there was a little screening of a few different anime movies, most were boring but, the one that stood out to me and my friend was about this chick in a red dress.

She was new at this school I believe, and she always had this heart shaped locket on her, any way she gets attacked when walking home with a friend who has a crush on her if it helps the dude had a fat face and red/orange hair, and when she gets attacked her locket starts glowing and releases this bright light, she becomes this bad ass warrior chick with white armor and whoops the people that jumped her. I dont remember details of the sword though, I know that would help.

Anyway, she doesn't remember anything when she was the warrior, if I remember details completely she ends up learning about the locket and realizing who she is.. but for the life of me I can't remember the name of it, and it's stuck with me for 20ish years!

I believe the words ""and the heart shaped locket""  were in the title. Maybe ""the heart shaped pendant""

Please help guys, also I've already looked into JUBEI CHAN and it's not that.

I enjoy the world building and aesthetics of the Isekai genre but the biggest thing that ruins it for me is the fact that the MCs are so ridiculously overpowered.

The biggest offenders for this are characters like Ainz from Overlord and Anos from Maou Gakuin.

I also do not enjoy ridiculously underpowered MCs like Subaru from Re:Zero and Kazuma from KonoSuba.

The reason why Mahou Sensei Negima's Magic World arc (Isekai arc) was so enjoyable for me is because the MC Negi started off as a moderately above average mage then got a huge power boost that made him seem OP at first but the gap between him and the arc's main antagonist named Fate is still very noticeably large and he also still needed to use his intellect do defeat stronger opponents like Rakan.

I do remember that man was pivotal to the anime movie/series, and am not entirely sure, but presume that he was malicious, tho it is vague for me now. It was a dubbed version in my native language and I remember the man, as he was falling, screamed ""godfather"" (makes more sense in my language) to the man who I presume pushed or let him go.

Eminence in Shadow is an anime that really doesn’t take itself seriously, but also kinda does at the same time. You can’t deny the fantastic animation, great voice acting and awesome OST.

To explain a bit more, I hate Gap Moe. Not in the personality way, more in how a female tomboy character changes to be more feminine and therefore is cuter/better than she was before. I hate this shit. It’s the same trope as the whole “girls takes off glasses and is suddenly beautiful!”

To me it just makes they’re characterisation weaker and the love interest come off as shallow. I know it’s a bit complicated than that but I just want to know if this is the kind of story I’m in for before I sink anymore time into it.

But I digress. This has made me curious if there are any other Anime that had really good source material but are neglected due to bad adaptations?

296,is arifureta season 2 worth watching if I didn't like the first season?,117gjko,So I forced myself to watch Arifureta despite its boring pacing and *awful* CGI. Should I give season 2 a go or simply drop it?,r4dditb4nnedm3,15,0,0.18
297,Need help finding an anime,117gkxl,"I’m not fully sure, if it was an anime show, a short OVA or anime movie, but I vaguely remember the plot.

The protagonist called a random phone number by accident and started a timer. Once the timer is done counting, something bad will happen. Something big will explode or whatever. To stop the timer, the guy has to remember the number he called, but can’t seem to do so - until some random moment. It was snowing outside, he was in a phone booth, called the number and the timer stopped.  

It sometimes feels like a fever-dream, like a show that never really existed, but I want to make sure that I remember it correctly.

300,"'Kingdom' - have you heard of it, tried it and gave up or watched it and ended up loving it?",117ev34,"**Kingdom** has hit me hard with just how awesome it is and I'm curious if many others in this sub have heard of it or even tried it. It's rarely mentioned these days.

I only found it on Crunchyroll a few weeks ago (https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRWE89KMR/kingdom) and have been pretty addicted to it, watching at least 5 or 6 episodes a day. 

Unfortunately many people were put off it when it initially started airing due to the extremely poor CGI. Thankfully that slowly improves and is eventually replaced with more traditional 2D animation.

It starts off looking like this:

https://ambivalen.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/kingdom1.png

and progresses to this:

https://www.otaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kingdom-Anime-TOP.jpg

Four seasons (129 episodes) have been animated so far with a fifth due in 2024.

I would urge anyone who has a passing interest to give it a try - do your best to push past the dodgy CGI and see it for what's really important, namely the excellent story.

Usually longer anime have a shit ton of the stuff to keep from catching up with the manga so I get why they do it, I just hate having to skip through sometimes up to like 10-12 mins worth of junk. I know there's shit like DBZ Abridged, but that's not really the same (tho it is fantastic in its own right). If anyone could point me in the right direction that'd be awesome, and if no one has heard/seen something like it I'm thinking of possibly doing it myself, though it seems like a massive undertaking for the longer animes, so I may start with shorter 12-24 episode shows.

313,[2022] Best Seiyuu of the Year - NOMINATIONS!,117citb,"Nominate here:

* [Female Category](https://animebracket.com/r-anime-best-female-seiyuu-of-2022/nominate)
* [Male Category](https://animebracket.com/r-anime-best-male-seiyuu-of-2022/nominate)

After 8 seasons of Seiyuu contests, I have now finally decided to start a new contest where you can vote for your favorite Seiyuu of the year! I'm going to assume most of you are already familiar with how I run recent seasonal contests, but for annual contests (and general ones if I ever do them again), I'll include the anime character's name(s) alongside the seiyuu's name (which was what I did in earlier contests). For the character names, there will be either 2 or 3 depending on how much text I can fit into one entry.

As usual, nomination will last for 2 days.

Note that only those who have roles in the previous season can be nominated. Other pointers to note:

* Family name → Given name order for consistency. Example: Sakura Ayane instead of Ayane Sakura
* If a seiyuu has already been nominated, you can submit the same one again with a different image or role, but that will be subject to approval.
* For source, insert the anime name and its respective season if it's not season 1. Example: Tensura S2 Part 2
* For link to image, insert an image link showing the seiyuu, not the character that the seiyuu voices.

The Saga of Tanya the Evil is an alternate World War I in a world with magic.  That means that it's set in a re-skinned Europe, where countries like Britain, France, and Germany exist, but have just been renamed and perhaps had their borders slightly modified.

Well, this also means that there is no version of the show where everybody speaks the right language.  Watch it in Japanese, and nobody is speaking the right language.  Watch it in one of the dubs, and only one of the main combatants is speaking the right language.  But...they (almost) all could be...

The show is dubbed into English, French, and German.  So, imagine for a moment a version of the show where the subtitles are in the viewer's language, but the English dub is used for the Commonwealth, the French dub is used for the Republic, and the German dub is used for the Empire.

I hope this is alright, I watched an anime about a decade to 13 years ago, and I am trying to find it again and have been struggling. I have no idea when it originally aired or actually any of the characters.

I remember it was animated with the very obvious 3D CGI of the 00's, similar to something like [a student had designed it where nothing blends](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ab929d4c333a90f68190786182ff11dd-lq)

I remember it defaulting to German as the language with English subs (maybe it's a German animation? But I couldn't find it searching that either).

The show followed some sort of zombie apocalypse, but instead of normal zombies, it infected vehicles I think.

Compared with light and fluffy rom-coms like Tomo-chan or action anime like Reborn to Master the Blade, where I can't wait to watch the episode as soon as it drops. I want to like Hikari No Ou,  it looks like a ghibli movie, and I like fantasy. It doesn't have the conventional anime tropes, but it's also so damn serious and dark all the time.

I mean, its a shounen, with the MC just crying and being scared and not rly being able to throw a punch, its basically hotheaded teenage drama all of the events happening, and well, ""The Big Brawl"" is some of the worst animated shouned fights I HAVE EVER SEEN! these guys are supposed to be hard boiled delinquents and literally everyones throwing punches like fucking toddlers, and the production level of it all is also horrid, using cheap and lazy angles etc etc. im insanely disappointed and also shocked how the show was so praised AND THIS BADLY DONE WHAT THE FUCK

346,What's an fight that uses music and rhythm really well?,116z5zj,"What the title says. 
I'm trying to find fights that use music (internal, external, even just the sound of punches kicks etc.) to give rhythm to the fight.

347,Zombieland Saga Theory: why the girls are sentient and why it has to do with calamari,116y418,"ok so we know that the girls in zombieland saga aware of their surrounding, have different tastes and personalities, and besides their limbs sometimes falling off, act and think like normal human beings. But they just used to be regular, brain dead, shuffling zombies. its possible that I'm overthinking this and the answer is just ""magic"" or ""don't think about it too hard, but what if it has something to do with all the squid they eat?

all the zombies love and eat squid; even romero, and especially Tae. and this isn't some minute detail either, their love of squid is referenced multiple times and when the manager was introduced, Sakura called attention the fact that he had squid tentacles in his pocket. 

I don't know exactly how accurate this is, but squid tentacles have a lot of neural tissue, and kind of have a mind of their own. And one of the defining characteristics of zombies in modern day culture is that they hunger for brains. and its pretty clear they're inspired from modern day zombies; they have the green skin, detachable limbs that can still move around, drool, groans, shambling behavior ect. however, the only thing they don't show is that they want to eat humans. specifically their brains. before the woke up, the zombies never really tried to bite the kotaro, and tae- who most likely than not is still unawoken- does try to nom on other humans, but their on their person, mostly their hair or clothes. 

so here's my theory: Zombies hunger for brains because they need the neural tissue to repair/maintain their brains from the damage they received from death and decay. however, for moral reasons kotaro can't allow them to nom humans (ironic, considering he's using them as unpaid labor who never tire and literally brought girls back from the dead), so instead he gives them squid tentacles; chock full of neural tissue for them to digest and reassemble into their brains. the zombies, being fed, don't actively try to eat humans anymore and even develop a taste for it. after a certain point, they have enough brain matter to ""awaken"" and act like normal humans again, with intelligence, memories, and personalities.

now this has some pretty big implications and holes, feel free to point them out, but we're dealing with a seris about black magic, aliens, talking zombies, and dance numbers. logic has kind of gone out the window (and I love them for it). but I think this covers a big mystery in the series.

352,So I Just Finished Carole & Tuesday...,116xa5a,"...and I loved it.

Shinichiro Watanabe has been and is my favorite anime director, but despite how much I love all of his works, I had been putting off watching Carole & Tuesday. I had dismissed it as being ""too safe."" The plot (based off the first couple episodes) felt generic, and the choice of acoustic pop music didn't interest me for the main duo didn't interest me. So I dropped it.

Then about 2 years later, I decided to give it a second try. And Watanabe didn't disappoint with Carole & Tuesday. The plot was straightforward, but the characters were fully fleshed out. 

Where it really shone though, was with the music, and the performances. Regardless of whether you liked the music or not(I didn't particularly like the duo's or Angela's music that much) you can't deny that the effort put into not only the singing but also animating the singing was astounding. **Watanabe got Denzel Curry, Thundercat, and Flying Lotus.** Dude consistently makes banger soundtracks. 

While it wasn't my favorite Watanabe work, the amount of effort he puts into his works really shone enough for me to say it is one of the best anime to come out in the past 5 years.

355,Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin = A great but flawed take on the Universal Century,116wps1,"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin: The Origin is shockingly good. Like it's insane how great the OVA is. From its well paced story to quirky characters, I, a Feddie simp, didn't expect to like this Zeon focused anime. Despite being an alternate take of the Universal Century, its still a great take on the UC worth watching.

* Plot: 
   * The story begins with “in medias res”, at the Battle of Loum with the introduction of Char Aznable in his iconic Zaku II taking down multiple Salamis class cruisers. And then takes us back where it all began, with the assassination of Zeon Zum Daikun in UC 0068 when tension between Zeon and the Federation began to grow. This forces Daikun’s children to go into hiding with the Zabis growing stronger in power until eventually starting the most infamous war known to man. 
   * The beginning cemented how the series is about to end, but still gives the anime some breathing space to naturally get to that point. The story is really well paced, as it takes its time into developing its path towards the one year war. It allows both the characters and setting to develop smoothly with being filled with needless filler that takes us out of the anime. Although not all the plot points were perfect (which I'll get to later), all of them were necessary components towards the plot. 
   * However, despite the anime doing a great job at making us feel for Zeon, It would've been nice if they toned it down a bit with the Feddies. I get the whole idea is to make the Zekes more understandable antagonists, but I would've liked it if they were at least a handful of Federation troops who weren't straight up jerks and made us see that not all Feddies we're stuck-up pricks that makes us want to side with Zeon more, but that's just me. Overall, the plot is very strong and keeps going without a hitch
* Characters: 
   * Every character in this OVA just something “extra” that just adds to their charm. It's like they allow these characters to let loose when they should be acting normal. It is just this over the top attitude with the great voice acting that makes these characters so memorable, but I'm getting out of topic. 
   * Let's start off with the main man himself, Casval Daikun (aka Edouard Mass, aka Char Aznable). And this anime ain't hiding how badass he is, they make him more of an anime protagonist than a regular anime protagonist. From Episode 1 onwards, he achieve may feats that would make anyone blush, from piloting a Guntank as a little boy to getting into a sword fight with a knight to even going one on one with a Indian mercenary, he constantly treads the line between badass and over the top coolness. I also like how he ain't afraid to speak his mind, like when he calls out a Federation Officer for mistreating young Zeonic trainees. I also like that he can be a softie too when his sister, Lalah, and even Garma as he cares for all three of them. “Cuz he would never betray anyone, right”? 
   * Speaking of which, I should get to his little sister, Artesia Deikun (also known as Sayla Mass). Her evolution from innocent child to hardened fighter is so tragic by how well developed it was. She starts off the series as a well meaning child who tries to keep her remaining family together with whatever she's got, but with them going one by one, her good girl demeanor slowly chips away. She faces heartbreak after heartbreak, yet she keeps going and remains strong. We need more well written female characters like her, instead of that girl boss crap we usually get. 
   * And then we got the Zabis, and boy aren't they just oozing with personality. Nearly all of them feel different and distinct from one another, with each of them having their own goals and methods. No one Zabi is the same, and I'm happy for that. 
   * Kycilla doesn't hide how fucked up she is, cause GOD DAMN she's sinister. With the creepy interaction with Casval in the 1st episode, it cemented how much of a villain she'll become in the One Year War. And it doesn't stop there, as she sends spies after Daikun's children, explodes a transport with INNOCENT PEOPLE just to kill one target, and then had the mayor of Granada killed (or was it Von Braun. I dunno, I always get those 2 confused). She's evil and ain't trying to hide it. 
   * Garma is actually utilized pretty well here and I like how he's presented as the rich kid who wants to earn his position instead of just being given to him because of his status. I also like how much Char gets inside his head and makes him more jealous on purpose; it foreshadows Garma’s later downfall on Earth. I also like how precious he is to Degwin. Even though  doesn't have a lot of personality that gets fleshed out here, I do like how he shows affection to his youngest child. Adding to how upset he was at his funeral in the original. 
   * But by far, my favorite is definitely Dozel. He just screams lovably aggressive and shows it with his family. He's just a tuff lovable bozo who yells out his feelings. But I wouldn't go as far as to say all of the Zabis are fleshed out. There's one of the brothers who died in a car explosion and I instantly forget about him. And it was a missed opportunity to fleshed out Giran. He's going to be the man who starts the One Year War and he barely has any personality. We barely know him and barely care about him as a character. 
   * I also found the rivalry between them and the Ral family kinda pointless. It just exists to give Ral a reason to hate the Zabis, and it's barely brought up in the rest of the OVA. It wasn't a thing in the original UC, as Ral never really had beef with them, he just wasn't a fan of their methods. I still love Rambal Ral in this, as he's well characterized as being a good soldier with a moral compass, along with his cute relationship with Crowley, who's also greatly represented. I just wished his dad was better characterized.
   *  Speaking of poor characterizations, let's talk about the Feddies. They aren't as compelling as the Zeeks and are either portrayed as dumbass jerks or reminders of what's gonna happen during the One Year War. And before you ask, “well how do we sympathize with Zeon if they don't portray the Feddies as jerks”? I mean, War in the Pocket managed to do just fine without any Federation antagonists, so what's this anime’s excuse?. This also leads to a multitude of continuity errors between this and the original.
   *  This is especially the case for Amuro, although his characterization here is still pretty good, but I don't need to constantly be reminded that he's gonna be the Gundam. Especially since he didn't know what the Gundam was until the invasion of side 7 in the original. While Here he found out about it in his dad's office. Why Tem would have this classified stuff in his house is beyond me. I won't cover everyone's Feddie as they ain't characterized well or are just forgettable. One interesting thing though, in the original movie trilogy movies Ryu Jose is voiced by Bob Papenbrook, but in this series he's voiced by his son Bryce Papenbrook. I wonder if this is just a coincidence or if he took the role because of his dad. If anyone is ever at a con where he's doing a Q&A, feel free to ask him this. One last character I want to talk about is Char Aznable (not Casval). He perfectly represents the issues with this OVA, he just exists just to tell us how Casval got his nickname. Overall, the characters were very divisive. They're either over characterized or under developed. But I never found a character I actively hated, so props to that.
* World Building: 
   * With the Origin taking place before the OYW, it was interesting to see the world of the Universal Century in the beginning. From how life was in Side 3, how Zeon built up their military, to even life on Earth, we got to see how different the UC was before we knew it today. I really did like how they showed us what the Texas colony used to look like before it turned into a desert wasteland. 
   * However, this leads to more disconnections between this and the original UC timeline. Although stuff like Operation British and the Battle of Loum did really happen in both timelines, not a whole lot else in this OVA actually happened in the original UC. The Salamis crashing onto an agriculture block of the colony didn't really happen, along with the rebellion that followed. Casval never went to Jaburo, professor Minovsky never died on the moon when he defected (his death was never even confirmed in the original continuity), or even the death of the mayor of Granada/Von Braun. There's more, but I'll leave that to the MS lore. The world building itself is pretty decent, it's just gonna be a glaring problem for any die heart UC fan to keep track of what's canon and what's not.
* Mobile Suits:
   * The Origin designs for the mobile suits are actually pretty good. I especially love the evolution of the Mobile Worker to the granddaddy of all mobile suits, the Zaku II. The Guncannon and Guntank looks good too, along with the RX-78-2 that has blueprints and one final scene. However, this doesn't change the fact that these probably have more glaring continuity errors that cements this OVA being an alternate take of the UC. And this starts with the mobile worker itself, as it was never that bulky and it wasn't even made for space work. Also, Zaku Is were just Zaku Is and weren't called bugu Zakus like in the OVA. As for 3 elephants in the room, none of them were even made until after the Battle of Loum. Although I can buy that the RTX-44 (the vehicle the Guntank was based on) looked something similar to the Guntank Early Type we see in the OVA. As for the Guncannons we see getting hacked and slashed by the Zaku Is, they weren't even made until after General Revil was saved from captivity and convinced the top brass to authorize the V project instead of Tem Ray asking Anaheim. On top of that, the Gundam was built in tandem with the Guncannon and Guntank, so that makes Tem pitch to Anaheim non canon. And I know you're gonna ask, “how do I know what's canon and what's not”? Outside of some simple research from the accessible Gundam wiki, if you ever bought a High Grade gunpla model kit, you'll notice that under HG you'll see what timeline or series the MS the kit is based on is from. If it was a Universal Century kit it would say HGUC. But if you bought a kit from the Origin series, it'll just say HGGTO. In other words, this series is constantly reminding you that this is an alternate take of the UC timeline.
* Vertic:
   *  This OVA is without a doubt high quality and one of the stronger Gundam OVAs since it still has a really good story and a great cast of characters with amazing voices, further proving that Keith Silverstein is the best Char voice. The main problem of the series is how different it branches from the OG Gundam. And what’s weirder is that the manga that the OVA is based on isn’t even a prequel, it’s a retelling of the One Year War. It probably would’ve been exactly that, but I think they changed that because Tomino didn’t want his original work to be remade. IDK, that’s what I think. But even so, its positives definitely outweigh its negatives as it's still a really solid series. I would still recommend it to any fans of the Universal Century, but for people who want to start the UC, that’s when things get a little complicated. All I can say to the beginners is that 20-30% of the stuff in the OVA isn’t fully canon. Overall, I highly recommend this.",Yakuza-wolf_kiwami,7,28,0.85

368,Are Anime Avoiding Filler Eps and Slow Progressing Arcs?,116rwvv,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but why does it seem like anime is completely running away from filler eps. Or maybe they're scared of slowing down the progression of stories all together. All the new age Shonen I've watched have zero filler. Its like they are scared to add them because the masses view on filler has always been negative. I never really had a problem with filler eps or arcs (sometimes arcs can get pretty annoying), but now I really notice their importance in the development of an anime.

&#x200B;

Anime like Demon Slayer, Black Clover, etc. are good, but it feels like there is so much missing in many areas of the story. Filler and Slower arcs help develop the characters personalities, the watcher's perception of time in the story, characters abilities, relationship between characters, cartoony/comical feel. Lastly and most importantly, it helps develop a nostalgic feeling for the consumer's.

&#x200B;

Think about it, your favorite anime would probably not be our favorite if it wasn't for those slow and sometimes annoying training, story, and filler arcs.

I think anime should just slow down a lil an focus on the things that don't seem important.",Full-Thing936,28,0,0.23
369,I finally watched 86,116rkre,"I was in that spree of watching War-themed movies and shows. Mostly western movies. Then I finally got to watch the famous movie ""Grave of the fireflies"" and I thought to myself: Are there any other War-themed animes out there? I already watched ""Saga of Tanya the evil"" and by a Reddit post I got introduced to ""86"". I checked a few reviews and some even claimed it as a **Masterpiece**, which, to be fair, is thrown around a lot lately and kinda lost it's meaning. However, 3 things were marked as masterfully executed: *True nature of war and a complex war story ; unique and great characters in a character driven story; a satisfying end.*

I got excited and started watching. The first 2 episodes peaked my interest. A story similar to the *Franxx* where both sides are displayed? An idea with great potential. I started to like the visuals and the action was fine, too. The action was not the focus and that was fine by me. I was here for some complex war story. I also had some small interest in some characters.

Well, after the 3 episode the show went downhill. The naive Female lead was starting to annoy me and the same goes for the other side. Most of those teenagers were nothing but... teenagers. And not even interesting ones. The worst thing is that even the adults in a professional field acted like teenagers?? Even now I forgot like 90% of all characters that were present the first half of the show. The only one who I had some kind of interest left was Shin. The Problem with these type of stoic characters is that, even when they are interesting at the beginning, they start to get boring quite fast because of how they are written. The unique and great characters that the reviews mentioned were nowhere, not even at the end. There was some kind of character development from the Female lead that I cared to notice, but that development made me hate her even more. Really really poorly written and forgettable characters.

The point ""*True nature of war*"" is also a stretch into the next dimension. I was definitely hoping for something different, actually well executed and thought through. There was war and there was death, but I didn't really care about any of the dying characters in said war. It just didn't ""feel"" like actual war, but anime characters dying. The funny thing is that there are amazing war-themed movies where you don't see anyone directly die and they still show you the true and cruel nature of war. In 86 it's like: Yea some person died.   
Other things that bothered me were stuff like: shin destroying 2000 enemies all by himself making me unable to feel any kind of danger for the main chars; the fact that the Female lead was a mayor while still being useless + the way she talked to her superior without getting her ass fired; and some other small things that made no freaking sense. ""*True nature of war*"".

So the only thing that I was looking forward to was the satisfying end. And I have to admit: The ending was actually nice. I didn't cry like the hardcore fans maybe, and I also cringed at some parts. Still, the last 2 episodes were nice. That's it. They were nice, but not amazing. Although, compared to the rest of the show it was the highlight.

Conclusion: I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, by any means. But I can see why people like it as it is at least trying to show interesting topics.  
I think the core reason why I didn't like it was because I was watching well written War movies before 86. Even though I didn't like it, I would also not call it a bad anime. It was rather frustrating than bad, but at least it tried to rise from the generic pool of most shows.",EdSheeeeran,42,0,0.3

Hello everybody, time for the comment of the day... or rather two of them. For Episode 47 we have u/KendotsX for their [expert journalism, yet also knowing when to draw lines:](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11509c6/tekkaman_blade_rewatch_episode_47_discussion/j8z7rv8/)

>PS: I'm not touching whatever cockblocking is happing between D-Boy, E-Boy and Aki. I'm not being paid enough for this.

And for Episode 48 we have... [just a really good write up](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/115vllf/tekkaman_blade_rewatch_episode_48_discussion/j93jv40/) by u/pantherexceptagain which pointed out many *Laughs in Rewatcher* moments.

1) Ultimately, what did you think of D-Boy's final fate? 

2) Do you feel this made for a solid enough an ending for the show as a whole?",Raiking02,126,17,0.83

Question of the Day:

Who made the best cake?

&nbsp;

Comments of the Day:

/u/LeonKevlar [has a good explanation](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/115uqal/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_28/j93eanc/):

>One of the things that were never answered in the anime is how did those Enchanted Cards end up looking up like Clow Cards. My headcanon for that is that Maki probably found the Shot Card herself and liked the design that she ended up making charms based on that one Clow Card.

/u/No_Rex [is enjoying this show's relationships](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/115uqal/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_28/j93e8xp/):

>Sakura and Li are rivals in two ways, but the series is doing a great job of showing how they gradually move closer (tbf, they are the MCs, so them having the best character development is to be expected). Not sure yet if they are supposed to end up as the canon pair, or just good friends, but it is very enjoyable watching their rapport getting better with each episode.

**Clow Card Fortune Book**

**Today's card:**

**[THE SWEET](https://imgur.com/a/rcml2NA)**

New Love. Popularity. Appearance of dependent mind.

**Playing Card when Substituted:** 10 of Hearts

**Card’s Message:**

A special person that softens your heart just by being near you. Your work evaluation seems to rise quickly if you use your cheerfulness to the best of your ability. Your love life can be kept at a stable state for a while.

**Card’s Warning:**

It is good to value communication with a friend, but watch out because you tend to sometimes depend on it a bit too much.

378,The Current Anime Slump,116pvlx,"Irritation, frustration, exasperation, is what I would say about my current mood regarding Anime. Yet, I still hunger for it. But, maybe more then anything its for the stories the medium can tell. The possibilities it can provide that a live action or book can't provide.

Anime has the potential to tell us stories where others just by the nature or scope of it can't go. No need for elaborate productions, sets, stunt doubles, locations, among many other such factors.

A major source of this frustration is the action and romance. The repetitive themes, cliches and tropes.

How many stories do we really need to be told about mass murdering virgin hero. Sure, it was hilarious for a time and while mostly not great stories they were fun.

Maybe the most convincing anime I have recently seen and was able to enjoy is Dance Dance Danseur. Besides my utter lack of interest in ballet and whatever else was going on with the show, there was some depth to it and I believe accomplished what it set out to do. It was relatable even while myself I couldn't relate to the premise subject.

Most anime: Drama, Action, Romance, there is always some type of handicap going into these, that I'm struggling to buy into or suspend my disbelief to be able to enjoy.

Existential crises on fighting monsters? Killing a bunch of people? Saving the world?...No, its holding hands, hugs and kisses.

What was fun has turned into irrational non-sense.

Im not advocating or demanding the need for graphic violence or gratuitous scenes. Just that these stories stay true to their subject matter and be consistent towards its expectations.

When I watched Hikaru no go, revolving around the board game, I got what I came for. It was enjoyable and fulfilled the expectations it set out. It wasn't about romance or action, though the game was certainly romanticized, that was fine, it made sense.

Maybe I have watched too much anime, or maybe not enough, maybe I have somehow skipped or missed some good anime.

It just feels like there is no anime worth to watch. How I miss the days of watching Naruto, Bleach, Berserk, Attack on titan, etc... for the first time, and not bothered by its short comings have gone.

in the end I guess I made this post as both a complaint and a plea in the hopes for some anime recommendation's. Though I fear I have probably watched everything deemed good by most people.",Leather-Vegetable556,29,0,0.2

First of all the over sexualization of teenage character always gives me the creeps. Villians like dio or kira yoshikage were so lame to me(specially dio, since dio is like my second favourite singer ever, it just bugs me that dio in part 3 is so bland) also, after reading reading five partes I cant even begin to comprehend how fights work on this show. yeah, this is my personal opinion and I just wanted to know what you have to say about this series",Meg4tron_culiaO,12,0,0.09

It's a lovely romantic movie with a message to chase your dreams no matter how impossible they may seem. 
I enjoy the film, it was a light-hearted experience, especially seeing Chiyoko's life as a young girl to a retired actor who lives her life alone with peace & quiet. It hits deep with your emotions but in a good-feeling way. 
Watching Chiyoko's facial expression is so adorable and the animation is a sight to see , the transitions are one of the best and inspire me to one day be close to animation like that. 
It's a movie that you have to watch at least once every year it's that beautiful. 
Chiyoko's fan in the movie was a good thing to see since he cared and wanted the best for her. I admire that he didn't want to benefit from her but instead show his gratitude for the good she caused for his life. 
100% Recommend this film to anyone who loves a progressive story with beautiful animation and a lead in Chiyoko Fujiwara, who's wholesome & kindhearted. 🪷🗝🎥

* has a flying car and sometimes complains that ""cars back then use to be more controllable""

The Rikka episode was similar in that we got to see the characters act and re-act in real time. It's also interesting in that all of these episodes our heros are missing for most of the episodes.

I’ve watched about 12 episodes and the plot is so unsubstantial that the only reason I will be watching is just to see an epic battle sean where Cid absolutely obliterates everyone.

Edit: Thanks for all of the comments I see my expectations of the show were completely off and it is a parody on popular isekai genres.",chessychurro,72,0,0.32
394,Anime Crash Course 101 Help,116lmi7," Hi, long story short matched with an avid anime fan girl. Besides 1 punch man, I no nothing about anime. Can anyone give me some rly popular shows to watch, even some 1 liners/flirt to impress this girl? She also reads Manga as well.",PharmDeeeee,17,0,0.43
395,New Dubs For Old Anime.,116liw1,"I just saw the news that one of my favourite anime of all time, Gunbuster, is finally getting a dub after 30 years. I'm out of the anime news cycle as I mainly stick with older 80s/90s/early2000s titles because I'm 30+yo man addicted to nostalgia.

But I was wondering is there any other older titles that have gotten this new dub treatment I should check out?",skikesy,8,0,0.36
396,About Isekai anime languages.,116lbsm,"Though all spoken languages in Isekai anime are Japanese or, made Japanese in the process. In what language their alphabets are made out of? They all seem so weird languages that are not even Japanese.",Olamias,9,0,0.27
397,"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [February 19th, 2023]",116kw8v,"Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2023 season (like **Kubo-san won't let me be Invisible!** or **Spy Classroom**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Mairimashita! Iruma-kun Season 3**).

With regards to Fall 2022 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **Bocchi the Rock!** or **Mob Psycho 100 III**) if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

        [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

comes out to be [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

It is about a school girl that find a mysterious boy that dies shortly after the movie starts, and the girl mistakes his twin brother for him. The twin brother then gets intercepted by some kind of Government that attacks him with an attack helicopter on a hill and he and the girl flee into a cave where they enter some kind of other world protected by a ""Guardian"" of sorts.

I decided to read the manga since it looks like a sequel is never gonna happen and man I’m telling you, if ufotable adapted season 4 with the mashiba vs sawamura fight it would pop off more than demon slayer ep 19. Probably

410,The CGI in anime,116d0fd,"I felt the need to ask for your general opinion.  I've been watching anime selectively for a few years now, I carefully choose what to watch and what to dedicate my time to.  What I notice though is that lately most of the anime I watch end up having bad CGI.  Especially in fantasy anime and the like where cgi tend to be used on a large scale.  I swear that as much as I like the anime itself, then I end up not watching it anymore, it annoys me terribly to watch badly done scenes, it completely diverts my attention from the story and what happens.  So I ask myself once again, why produce such crap?  What is the point of running and releasing 10 anime a month if at the cgi level at most one or two are saved?  What's the meaning?  Lately I've already stopped following at least 2/3 anime for this very reason because I couldn't bear to bear certain badly done scenes, with stylized characters repeated like photocopies.

Looking back now, I still think it's a really good 8/10 show, I still prefer it over golden time, butttt I definitely prefer stuff like Fruits Basket now that I've seen a bit more romance. Ami is still the best girl in that show though, nothing will change my mind",zackphoenix123,48,9,0.69

For me it's durarara because on one hand, Shizuo Heiwajima is my second favorite character in all anime, and Celty-Shinra is one of the best ships ever, but on the other hand, there's nothing too special about the plot. Just gang wars or whatever, the main character is one of the worst but not the worst (I mean Shinji from Evangeleon is unbeatable in that). And the plot is a bit too scattered with too many characters just ""being there"" but not getting air time.

428,looking for a specific anime (gore),1165x5j,"hello guys,

a few years ago i watched a compilation on youtube about gory animes, but there was one anime, that stuck in my head, but for the love of god i cant find neither the compilation, nor the anime, so i am turning to you in hopes of finding it.

as far as i can remember it was a fighting scene betweeen multiple people in a town and the camera/scene switched between those people back and forth. it was a pretty gory anime, and the people were no ordinary humans, meaning they had some kind of superpower. there was one guy, who got slashed vertically in half by a katana and instead of being dead, he was crawling or moving with his two halfes, like a zombie.

but that is as much as i can remember. it is not very specific, i know that, but i hope you can help me out!

thanks in advance",ALPHAyo,6,0,0.4

430,Mu La Flaga should have been the protagonist of Gundam SEED. Kira as the villain,1165qc5,"First off, I am coming from a biased position. I hate Gundam SEED, no not the kits I have SEED kits and will continue to buy more. I hate the anime, I absolutely loathe the Coordinators and their self righteous stance. I loath that goofy alliance fighting for peace while massacring thousands in every battle. I hate Kira, he is one of the poorly written macguffin characters created, don't give me that ""hE sAw gRoWTh"" No he experienced convenience. That's why I hate him, he's a shallow infallible character that I feel no sympathy for. Gundam SEED made me hate anime for years, I'd see anime I'd remember SEED, that died down when I watched Gundam 79 and that made me hate Gundam SEED so much more. Kira is a fucking Gary Stu who is blessed and encounters no real struggle. Yeah yeah sure, war this, coordinators that, but he never has his beliefs challenges. He never has other forces slapping him in the face. He's just a perfect teen boy who says things that everyone else has to listen to.  


but let's back up a bit. SEED has a lot going for it. The issue of space racism is very nuanced. We get to see how fear and hate drives this conflict. We get to see the hypocrisy in both sides. The cruelty in the Federation, and the end justifies the means attitude of ZAFT. and best of all, we get to see Rau La Cruset vs Mu La Flaga.  


Mu should have been the hero. There is so much to work with when it comes to Mu. He's an ace pilot, a legend in the federation. His enemy is another Ace. He is seen as the mentor to these young kids forced into the war. His romance angle, is 5000x sweeter than any of the other shit Kira has to deal with. Point is, these guy OOZES good character. He oozes, depth and dynamics.   
He should have been the main character. He should be the one piloting the Strike Freedom.  


And Kira? He should be a villain. He's self righteous, self absorbed and his beliefs are NEVER  challenged. He should have been the villain.",Extra-Lifeguard2809,4,0,0.23
431,Need help finding Anime name,1164r1z,"The only part I remember is a side character’s story, and I want the name of the character. He had a girlfriend who was super nice.

But then he went into debt (?) and needed money, so he broke into his gf’s father’s store and ended up burning it down. The father was in it and got paralyzed waist down. This might be from Tokyo Revengers but I’m not sure.",TuriGhi,4,0,0.33
432,Aggretsuko is one of the best fucking anime ever and no one talks about it,1164ofx,"I heard the fifth and final season of Aggretsuko had aired on Netflix and have been catching up on the series since I fell off around season 3 and holy shit. I forgot how good this fucking show was. It’s story and execution are extremely simple, but the characters and the themes the show explores are some of the deepest, most mature, and deeply human in the medium and I feel like a lot of what the show does super well is just kind of lost on a general anime audience who is mostly looking for cute girls or hard hitting action above all else.

The series follows Retsuko, a red panda, as she works a part time job and spends the night unleashing her complaints about life in death metal karaoke. What first seems like a silly little gimmick show about cutesy characters turning violent as the death metal kicks in quickly turns into a full-on exploration of late stage capitalism and the crushing depression that comes from being someone exploited by the system, knowing you’ll probably spend your entire life exploited by the company you work for. 

The series explores how, while always acknowledging the shitty situation Retsuko is in, how her desperation to escape leads to poor decisions that ultimately hurt her. Retsuko is consistently lost in escapist fantasy (especially at the start of Season 3 where she’s burning her funds on a VR boyfriend) and is seemingly never aware of the people around her who genuinely have her best interests at heart (even if misguided).

One of my favorite things about the series is how it can successfully develop once one-dimensional characters. Retsuko’s boss, Ton, a literal misogynist pig, is introduced as the final boss keeping Retsuko from true happiness. At the end of Season 1, Retsuko finds herself so deep in a bad situation, that she doesn’t even fully realize what she’s doing to herself, and it’s Ton at the end who is finally able to tell Retsuko that her behavior is ultimately self-destructive. Ton is absolutely aggressive, sexist, and old-fashioned to extreme fault, but he’s also the only person in the cast who isn’t afraid to tell Retsuko how things are and despite the awful parts of his personality, there is still worth in that. Season 1 especially does this to pretty much the entire cast.

Aggretsuko explores the crushing reality of being another cog in the machine in a dead end job (one that most of us are unfortunately fated to have without massive social and economic changes), but also explores how we can still find meaning in our lives. A consistent theme in Aggretsuko is one of connections and having healthy relationships with people. Early on, Retsuko becomes friends with two higher ups at the company who prove invaluable to Retsuko. This isn’t because they have a lot of power in the company with which Retsuko can exploit, but because they act as some of the first real friends she makes at her job, people she can confide in and be supported by emotionally. 

Retsuko’s romantic life is a center point in the anime, usually taking center stage at the end of every season (at least from the two full seasons I watched) and both plot lines have been really cool. I really like Season 1, where Retsuko quickly dives into a relationship with someone who simply doesn’t give a shit about her while ignoring her coworker Haida, who likes Retsuko and clearly is a good match for her (this is a plot line throughout the whole anime). It shows the difference between romance for the sake of romance and the potential of what could happen if you just wait to have it happen naturally.

One of the wildest things about this anime though is despite its themes being wildly anti-capitalist, it comes from Sanrio, creators of Hello Kitty. Not to mention the show is pretty much created entirely from one person, Rarecho. Artistic visions this potent are rarely seen in anime, especially as the seasonal cycle seemingly makes every anime look more and more the same. If any of what I said interests you, give this show a shot. At least going by how often I hear it talked about, not enough people are watching it.

Edit: In the middle of Season 3 (really fucking great so far) and wanted to take this chance to talk about how this is a show bold enough to have an idol group made up of a bunny and two guinea pigs (prey) and their manager is a leopard (a predator) which, while on the nose a bit, is a way harsher criticism of idol culture than I’ve ever seen in anime and I love it",willrsauls,12,8,0.58

434,Anime that deserve the FMAB/Fruits Basket/Bleach treatment?,1164e9r,"Lately, we've seen some great anime either their final arcs adapted (Bleach) or even had older series get complete remasters to properly follow the manga to its original end (Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Fruits Basket). 

That begs the question, which anime can you think of that either didn't get to finish their adaptations or had to settle for original endings? I know for me, Soul Eater is the primary anime I'd want to get the Fruits Basket treatment. The original was good, but it eventually became filler and had to settle for an original ending. An adaptation that properly followed the tone of the manga from beginning to end would be great.

Hitman: Reborn would be a series more akin to bleach, where they just need to adapt the final few arcs to complete the series. Even though a lot of fans have qualms with the ending, there's no doubting how great that series became from a gag series to a complete, full blown action series with major stakes. 

Can you all think of any other series that fall under those categories?",SChamploo12,82,31,0.79

439,Do people put old anime on a pedestal and overrate them?,1162ud1,"There are a group of people that believe modern anime is dogshit and old anime used to be way better. Do you think that’s actually true or is it just romanticising the past/nostalgia talking? 

Myanimelist certainly doesn’t think so. If you look at the top 100 entries, most of them are from the past decade. Now one reason is obviously recency bias but also because people that watch the older stuff tend to be more critical and harsher with their scores. So that list shouldn’t be taken too seriously.

I personally think there is great anime from multiple decades, both old and new but I also think some people do tend to overrate older anime. For example, I watched the original mobile suit Gundam recently and I didn’t think it was that great

443,can’t find what to watch,1162kvd,does anyone know a rom com anime where it’s two people who are already dating and they both are inexperienced (like shikimori’s not just a cutie),DoinkyPaw1,5,0,0.33
444,Sometimes...sigh... Sometimes this sub betrays me.[Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute! Spoilers... also long],1162jso,"A few months ago I saw a recommended anime on MAL and, while I know a little bit of Japanese, I wasn't sure 100% sure what *Jitsuryokusha* meant going from the Kanji but it sounded Kirito-esque what with the *Kage no*. 

So I cheked in here to confirm that the title was chuunibyou: *Eminence in Shadow*. I decided to have nothing to do with with it.

I **HAD** seen it perform well despite  it being on Hidive but, honestly? That didn't budge my opinion even an inch... until a week ago.

Seeing it at the top of the chart that our good /u/abysswatcherbel compiles for us made me a tad curious. Not enough to watch it, but I did wonder what it was about. However, it was a busy week so I didn't look further into it.

Then, today I saw that clip where the magic breast padding falls from some girl's magic spandex and I found it quite funny. I went into the comments, didn't read thoroughly but I fell under the impression that this was a comedy anime. 

I still feel stupid for not immediately realizing that, in modern anime, fantasy and comedy only come together in ***t̵̜̔h̶͖͝a̵͉͠t̶͍̕ ̸̬̑o̷̻̅n̶͔̓ḛ̷́ ̶̬̈́g̵̱̀ȇ̵̗n̷̠̓r̷̡͘ḙ̵̚***.

So I decided to watch later tonight, meaning two hours ago.   

It started off intriguing, but we are quickly introduced to protag-kun and, yup, that's a Shit-rito if I ever saw one. But it was not a comedy like I expected and it was also not ***t̵̜̔h̶͖͝a̵͉͠t̶͍̕ ̸̬̑o̷̻̅n̶͔̓ḛ̷́ ̶̬̈́g̵̱̀ȇ̵̗n̷̠̓r̷̡͘ḙ̵̚*** so I admit that I was getting pulled in. Especially since I know that ***t̵̜̔h̶͖͝a̵͉͠t̶͍̕ ̸̬̑o̷̻̅n̶͔̓ḛ̷́ ̶̬̈́g̵̱̀ȇ̵̗n̷̠̓r̷̡͘ḙ̵̚*** doesn't top charts anymore...

Say what you will about /r/anime but aside from that one overrated show that got undue attention for two cours, I felt that our collective taste was decent in 2022. I'm willing to keep watching this realistic Kirito turned Batman.

Bitch-rito gets killed.

At this point in the episode, I think I was so surprised that I swear to God thought this was going to be an anthology series or anything but certainly not ***t̵̜̔h̶͖͝a̵͉͠t̶͍̕ ̸̬̑o̷̻̅n̶͔̓ḛ̷́ ̶̬̈́g̵̱̀ȇ̵̗n̷̠̓r̷̡͘ḙ̵̚***. This doesn't last long, the credit speed is too fast and the episode felt short. Yup, 25% to go on the playtime bar.

""Oh it has to be a gag!"" thought I, stupidly. 

Cut to elf girls following caped Bitch-rito. **It's a fucking** ***ii̵͉͂s̶̘͊e̷͠ͅk̶͚̆ạ̷̈́i̸̗͘!*** 

Downvote me all you want but the only ***i̵͉͂s̶̘͊e̷͠ͅk̶͚̆ạ̷̈́i̸̗͘*** allowed in the VIP section is Mushoku Tensei. R̴͕̆e̸̳͊:̶̬͗Z̴̥̄e̴̱͒ȑ̷̩o̷͔̍ and **ALL** rest can go jump in front of a truck for eternity.

I feel betrayed, I did not see that coming. I don't mind admitting I'm a casual. I don't know what's going on with the most popular anime. But I also know what I will like nine times out of ten.

And it is because of that remaining one surprise that I will watch  more episodes of Kirito Ver. 38343908.1. 

Because sometimes I'm wrong and it's good to be open-minded about things. Let's hope there's more magical, fake breast and padding and credits fake-outs.

They nerfed the old characters so much. They made the old character look so bad like what has Naruto's haircut same as Gaara. Boruto isn't what the fans wanted. We wanted something like Minato, Naruto past Generations. That would have been way better. At least they could have ended the anime and manga with Naruto becoming hokage and his dream came true. That would have been way better then Boruto.  Six paths sage mode is way stronger then Naruto in Boruto. The stuff we have seen from Naruto and Sasuke in Boruto don't even compare to what we have seen in war arc Shippuden. Also Konohamaru was way stronger as a Genin fighting Pain then as a Jonin in Boruto. Every character from Naruto and Naruto shippuden now look terrible in Boruto and have gotten 90 times weaker. Scientific Ninja tools just ruin the entire Naruto series. There are so many more reasons why Boruto is trash. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are very very good though.",Itachi_Uchiha274,157,312,0.83

I’m looking for other shows that have charming music and an old art style, with a decent story. The only other show that kind of fits this category is Neon Genesis Evangelion, partly because of its amazing OP and EDs.

I really appreciate good art, and a coherent story is really important (I consider shows like demon slayer, hxh and JJK to be overrated, soulless shows that are all style over substance, sorry if that triggers u)

**Clow Card Fortune Book**

**Today's card:**

**[THE SHOT](https://imgur.com/a/pKUPMsl)**

Focus on the goal.

**Playing Card when Substituted:** Jack of Clubs

**Card’s Message:**

If you become greedy, you will fail. Ascertain why the goal is necessary. It is easy to become aggressive, but scolding yourself when you do will bring progress.

**Card’s Warning:**

You might hurt the other party, even though you didn't mean any harm. If you notice this occurring, humbly apologize.

1) Is it curious that they're recruiting for Walküre members from civilians, based on what happened to the Jamming Birds? Is the scenario also another jab at the Jamming Birds, given Mirage's comment?

2) Have any of the new world-building things shown so far particularly gotten your attention?

*Otonashi wakes up in the afterlife to find out he has no memories of his life before death. Desperate to survive in a war that could yield another unfortunate fate, he joins the SSS in the battle against Angel, whose very mission is to destroy all inhabitants of this afterlife. As Otonashi struggles to recover his memory and learn more about this world, he finds that not all is as it had seemed.* -Funimation description

The last rewatch for Angel Beats! was [six years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6bcra0/rewatchspoilers_angel_beats_rewatch_episode_1/), and I'd love the chance to watch it with everyone. It's got an amazing mix of (sometimes dark) comedy and more emotional moments packed into it, with a caste of memorable characters and some *really* good music.

My proposed schedule:

13th April | Episode 13 + Epilogue (~3 minutes)

15th April | OVA 2 - Hell's Kitchen
16th April | Final Discussion Thread

Threads will go up at **9:00 pm UTC**.

In the last rewatch the two OVAs were inserted into the season rather than being watched after - for those who have seen Angel Beats! before, do you think that would be a better way to schedule things? I admit, I do prefer the idea of ending with the last episode and special epilogue, I'm just not sure the OVAs will fit in properly.",TiredTiroth,66,74,0.92

Two years in the planning, I'm thrilled that the time is finally drawing close and I can post this thread!

The watch will begin on April 3, with threads going up at 22:00 GMT / UTC, same time as this one until the very end on May 25.

#Comment of the Day!! 

/u/zadcap was stalking is this whole watch. I think their comment kind of just highlights how special this rewatch has really been. 
>*""I have a confession to make. Rewatches are my favorite part of the r/anime community, and I check everything under the Rewatch tag daily to see if there's anything I want to jump in to.*        
>*This show was not one of those.     
But I decided to read through the episode 1 reactions anyway, to see if I was maybe somehow misunderstanding what this show was about.*        
>**I wasn't.**       
>*And yet, the reactions themselves were so humorous, I found myself checking back every day to see just what the heck was going on. I have not and do not plan on watching the show, but what a ride it was to get it all second hand. This was certainly a thing that happened, something that someone decided to animate and then convinced a whole team to go along.""* 

/u/Vaadwaur's commentary on how questionable the 
- The manga, which I might get to, was more serious up to where I read. But there's this...feeling I get that even the manga is the author working out her kinks or thinking about the teacher she wished she'd seduced when she was 12(This is actually the beginning of the age where teachers need to be aware of this option). Also, one particular spoiler [KnJ manga] >!Rin figuring out how to masturbate and the viewer knowing about it!< somewhat makes me not want to do that. Regardless, the anime gave us two 30 yos in the bodies of 3rd graders and a busty friend for them and I can't really let this pass.

481,I know it’s been talked about to death but Sally Amaki’s dual performance as both English and Japanese versions of Carol Olston is gold. And frankly I wish they’d do it more often.,115sgyv,The use of VA’s who actually speak fluent English and learned through actually growing up in English speaking nations for characters that are canonically from places like the USA etc is great. Even when they’re speaking Japanese. The accents come off as being inherently not Japanese and sound like someone who know the language but didn’t live there and that just works so well. It’s pretty rare though to see it happen. Idk what it was but last time I saw this was in some slice of life where 1 of the characters was from the UK and the VA was actually someone who grew up in the UK but had Japanese parents and moved back so her Japanese had a very British sounding flavor to it and sounded like she wasn’t as used to speaking it. Like the actual character’s life story. I know it’s small but those sort of details can really add flavor to a character. Not to mention it always feels off when the supposedly American or Russian or whatever character speaks Japanese as fluently and with the same vocal inflections and accent as the canonically native characters. It’s just as jarring as English VAs whipping out off pronunciations of Japanese words in their dialogue and hopping back into their New Yorker accent or whatever. Or when supposedly “English speaking” characters speaking English in. A very accented obviously not an English speaker accent.

487,I read the 5 Centimeter Per Second manga before I watched the film and I think I made a grave mistake,115ozq7,"This past christmas, my mom bought me the 5C/s manga and even though I'm not into romance stuff I read it through. It was so poetic and bittersweet and hurt my feelings. Since I just finished reading it today, I decided, ""Hey, maybe I'll watch the movie and compare! What could go wrong?"" as there were some scenes I wanted to see in motion.

Turns out the manga is a major expansion on the film's plot and ties up a ton of loose ends while maintaining the ending. However, I kind of hate how vague the movie is with the perspective of having read the manga first.

A lot of people love the film but honestly, compared to the manga it feels mid lol. I feel like the manga was the complete story Makoto Shinkai wanted to tell (I could be very wrong, of course).

495,What are your thoughts on Chrome Shelled Regios?,115ln4r,"What do you think of the show as a whole? What are the best and worst things about it, including the characters?",Delta-97,12,5,0.75
496,Specific kind of anime,115lltp,"Are there any anime out there that follows the story of a bad guy? And I don't mean an anti hero or origin story on how someone turned bad. Or even the I'll pretend to be bad but I'm really the hero situation. I mean the main character is the legit villain or just a genuine POS person. Kinda played out on the ""My friends give me powah"" deal",FlashSingingMasher,18,0,0.17
497,Ef a Tale of Memories ended up my fourth ever unfinished anime,115lkwb,"Short Review:

Honestly, I'm pretty mad at whoever recommended this. I mean, it's horrible. How many subplots are there?! We keep oscillating between like 5 groups of people, their own little lives. The protag is the generic inconspicuous male student (how original), and none of the heroines have more charm than a second hand sofa (no offense to furniture). The plot focus keeps moving between these groups of people too quickly, and too haphazardly. Just when you might be starting to get interested in one sub plot, they quickly move to another. The pacing of this anime could be used as a case study on how NOT to pace your anime. The to-and-fro prevented me from developing any sort of interest in any character or the plot. By the time I was done with ep 4 (that's 33% of the anime), I was just...done with it. I don't wany to know what happened to any of the characters, who got a good end, who got the short end of the stick. I just don't care anymore. So it was time to drop it. 


Tldr: an ambitious anime that seeks to overstuff its course with events and characters literally no one asked for. A good anime? No. One time watch? No. 

PS: The supernatural aspect was like adding a rotten cherry on a stale cake.",_scrapegoat_,0,0,0.15
498,Are there any anime with an actually evil protagonist?,115lezp,"I don't mean a dark hero like Accelerator or criminals like in Black Lagoon. 
What I mean is a character who backstabs and kills people that showed goodwill to him. Someone who'd kill without hesitation if it benefits him and who answers to no one but himself. 

Also, he has to get away with what he does.

I can only think of Golgo 13, but in Golgo 13 the story is rarely told from the perspective of the actual protagonist and even then Golgo 13 acts pretty much like a machine with no ambition beyond doing his chosen job of being a killer for hire. 

Also, the protagonist must absolutely not care for anyone else. If someone threatens him with his ""friends"" he should evaluate the benefits of whether it is worth spending effort to save them or not and leave them to die if the benefits aren't worth it.

Outside of anime there is Gu Daoist Master which fits the bill. But I'm looking specifically for an anime here.",SixBitDemonVenerable,118,11,0.68

What should I make her watch that might get her interested in the style/storytelling?

edit: how is this different from posts asking for all time favourites?ppl's favourites tend to change with time say they might forget how much they liked an anime or their tastes might have changed but rewatch counts remain as a fact they liked it a lot atleast once in their lifetime and that once might no longer be for them but may be a new once for someone else who discovers it now,furthermore just asking for favourites would make the list long as lot lot of shows are enjoyable, 'must watch atleast once'",actionwaifu,35,6,0.74

She knew Asshat was drugging and controlling her father but she did not even accuse him of it, sow some doubt at least but for all we know (anime wise) it might have worked and then it might have condemned Asshat.

Even if not, killing her father is bs because she knows Asshat is drugging and controlling him, she could have just killed Asshat instead to stop him and then get her father cured. 

For all we know the drug wears off when not administered regularly.

I have been passively hunting an anime title for months now and I do not have much information to go off of. I was a kid when I saw this title in a BlockBuster brick-and-mortar store, somewhere between 2006-2009. My memory is hazy but clear enough for me to remember that the cover art looked very similar to the image in this post. The provided cover art is for a game called Corpse Party: Blood Drive. So problem solved right? Nope! Blood Drive did not exist at the time and I am confident that it was an anime movie. If anyone has any knowledge on this obscure subject, I beg that you sate my curiosity.

539,What is the best romance this season?,1156uy7,"This season feels over saturated with romance compared to prior seasons, but I’m not complaining.

I dropped the show early cause I thought I had an idea of what kind of show it was, and that I'd seen it before. But damn, was I wrong.  I'm so glad I gave this show a second chance after hearing people rave about it.",ManufacturerFresh138,35,219,0.85

542,Can anyone please help me find this anime?,1155m5k,"I hope this is allowed, I have been searching for days now nonstop and tried TOMT, i'm hoping you guys will know what i'm talking about, I saw a clip on youtube of this anime clip (I think it was japanese with subs) where two guys are fighting, and the fighting effects were really well done like a 3D effect on some parts, where they were was a lot of stairs where one of the guys has a ""keysword"" looking thing ( I think? It was really big, The emblem was like a + sign or something, i think he had like red robes on) and he throws it and accidentally (or purposefully) kills a girl, perhaps other guys wife/gf/sister or something like that. I remember after the guy kills the girl on accident, the other guy gets really mad and starts running up the side of a building (i think this was a long sequence of him getting faster running up the building with an inner monologue maybe). That's all I can remember, I hope this is allowed and I will be so happy if someone knows what im talking about lol.",AndyCools,10,8,0.65
543,Wondering if anyone else has noticed this thematic parallel in anime,1155f9f," Hello anime fans, I'm new to the sub so I'm not sure where to ask this question but. I'm studying themes and parallels in anime storytelling, and I noticed something interesting: many popular protagonists are often shown enjoying a meal, such as friends at school or shonen protagonists with their group enjoying a banquet after a big fight.  
But!  
Villains, on the other hand, are rarely shown eating, rarely shown enjoying food and drink unless it's to drink in excess. I feel like this is an interesting way to show the differences between protagonists vs  antagonists, as if the bad guys don't enjoy their meals as much or aren't given the courtesy of being shown eating in manga/anime.  
I've found a few examples of this which seem to fit my theory, such as possibly Kaido from One Piece and Orochimaru from Naruto, but it's difficult to go through each chapter or episode that a given character appears in. So I'm wondering if any of you might know offhand some prominent characters who you don't remember ever seeing eat or drink (besides alcohol).",OkJob3587,5,0,0.31

548,"Food for thought: If Netflix buys AMC Networks, this would mean Sentai Filmworks and HIDIVE are part of it.",1153un8,"https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/01/28/netflix-should-buy-amc-networks-and-the-walking-dead/amp/

In a Forbes article written by Paul Tassi, he said Netflix should buy AMC Networks, and by that, this would mean Sentai Filmworks and HIDIVE.

“Buying AMC Networks, which has a $784 million market cap to Netflix’s $160.5 billion, feels like it could be a win for both brands. AMC feels like it’s teetering on the brink of ceasing to exist altogether, as a service like AMC+ is a hard sell with almost a dozen other more prominent streaming services to choose from, plus it still has confusing terms with its cable airings, where things aren’t as available as they should be, even for paying subscribers.”

The acquisition would effectively move all of Sentai's catalogue on HIDIVE to Netflix meaning the HIDIVE platform would shut down. IMO, Netflix already has the original shows not on CR or HIDIVE like Violet Evergarden (streaming), Eden’s Zero, Komi Can’t Communicate, etc…

Your take and opinions are welcomed.",SilverPlaqueVII,12,0,0.27
549,Anime with character(s) that display extraordinary *character*?,1153qoc,"My favorite piece of media of all time is Band of Brothers. It's a display of grounded, realistic, inspiring heroism. It shows how men of extraordinary character can stare evil and adversity in the eye.  


My favorite anime is March Comes in Like a Lion. On multiple occasions, it displays people with extraordinary character overcoming their own adversities.  


Are there any more shows that display character in a similar sense? I would love to watch something of this sort right now.

In the anime there’s a girl with short black/dark blue hair and (this is gonna real weird) she’s apparently inlove with/dating her own brother.

>Mizuki's arrival is one of my favourite character introductions in this series because of how much she stirs the pot! Sakura absolutely adores her, Shaoran is very wary of her, and she clearly has a connection to Touya. We can't also forget the fact that she has no problems cutting a path through the Maze Card with her shrine bell and how she is absolutely unfazed about everything she just witnessed.

there’s this anime i saw like 10 yrs ago on tv which i have forgotten the name and i wanted to ask y’all if you know abt it:
i only remember it was abt a little boy who lived w his mom and his dad wasnt around a lot because he worked in a ship or sth. the dad had given his son some tablet or sth to be able to chat w him and there was this scene where the boy could see his dad from the window and they were waving at each other and texting at the same time. and suddenly the mom came and she was so mad at her husband and she took the tablet and texted him “idiot idiot idiot idiot” like a million times. 
and i remember this other scene from the anime where the mom and the boy were at home w one of the boy’s friends i guess and the mom wanted to make them noodles or sth so she put the raw noodles in their bowls and poured hot water and asked them to close their eyes and when it was cooked she asked them to open their eyes and told them she made the noodle soup using her magical powers. 🤹🏻‍♀️

But despite the franchise airing for 20 years with over 900 episodes and 70 magical girls, there is a good chance that a lot of you are unfamiliar with it.

Or maybe you’re more familiar with the Precure franchise than you realize? Maybe you remember when My Hero Academia called it [Preyure](https://i.imgur.com/oakSSqH.png). Maybe you remember [Model Warrior Lily Cure](https://i.imgur.com/cqvzNyr.jpg) from Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.

This isn’t even all the references to Precure in Otaku culture. My point being that when I say Precure is iconic, I really mean it. 

#What is Precure

So what is Precure? Precure is a franchise of magical girl anime aimed at younger girls. It’s the series that inherited the will of Sailor Moon as the standard bearer for traditional magical girls for the past 20 years. While it is the same type of anime as Sailor Moon, there are some notable distinctions that have helped it stand apart:

* Precure is an anime original and not a manga.
* Precure reboots every year. There is a hard cap of 50 episodes per season and each season has a completely unrelated cast of characters, setting, and plot. So each season has its own complete story and every year there is a new jumping on point. 
* Precure has garnered a more sizable male fanbase. Yes this is an anime for young girls, [it’s audience also includes a lot of older boys as well](https://i.imgur.com/4HjmlqJ.jpg). This is thanks in large part to…
* Precure has a larger focus on physical combat. The franchise was created by Dragon Ball Z director **Daisuke Nishio** under the concept “Girls want to fight too.” So where Sailor Moon or Cardcaptor Sakura would use spells, [Nagisa would run up to her opponents](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/a669710d95c4a1d673cc85edc70fd9cc.mp4). The spirit of this has stayed true ever since.
* Precure has less focus on romance. It’s something you notice more as you watch other similar magical girl shows aimed at the same audience. Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, and Shugo Chara, are very heavily shoujo series. There are less bishounen and a stronger focus on the girls and their relationships.

The end result is that Precure has created a strange fusion of genres. It is essentially K-On! meets Dragon Ball Z. You get 15 minutes of wholesome, funny, zero fan-service, healing anime, followed by 5 minutes where [the girls beat the crap out of a wheelchair](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/78429807783d612eda4230ace674c44e.mp4).  #JustAnimeThings

But it really is the combination of both parts of the genre that make the franchise. It is silly, cute, wholesome, weird, mature, and badass, all at the same time. 

#Where to Start

Now this is a bit of a tricky question. You could start with the original series Futari wa Precure and work your way up the ladder of Precure.That would be a completely valid way to get into the franchise, but it is far from the only way, and I’d even go so far as to say that it's often not even the optimal way to get into the franchise.

The most commonly recommended way to get into the franchise is to just look at the girls and pick the series with the designs you like the most. This becomes a bit more daunting every year as just being tossed an image with 70+ girls to choose from can be quite overwhelming. So here is a quick rundown of every Precure season. 

**2004-2008: The Age of Experimentation**

[Futari wa Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/FutariWaPrecure-OP1.webm) - Misumi Nagisa and Yukishiro Honoka are Cure Black and Cure White in the original Precure that is a more down to earth and humble version of the magical girl genre.

[Futari wa Precure MAX HEART](https://v.animethemes.moe/FutariWaPrecureMaxHeart-OP1.webm) - Misumi Nagisa and Yukishiro Honoka return again as Cure Black and Cure White in a sequel season that is largely just more of the same.

[Futari wa Precure Splash Star](https://v.animethemes.moe/FutariWaPrecureSplashStar-OP1.webm) - Hyuuga Saki and Mishou Mai are Cure Bloom and Cure Egret in what is essentially just a remake of Futari wa Precure but more polished and streamlined.

[Yes Precure 5](https://v.animethemes.moe/YesPrecure5-OP1.webm) - Yumehara Nozomi is Cure Dream who joins with her four other friends to help save a hot guy who is a prince, her teacher, a hamster, her boss, and her love interest. Great for fans of romance and shoujo series. 

[Yes Precure 5 GOGO](https://v.animethemes.moe/YesPrecure5GoGo-OP1.webm) - Yumehara Nozomi and all her friends return as Cure Dream and the Yes Precure 5 alongside new members like Milky Rose in an installment that trades away the romance for more wacky and weird adventures.

**2009-2015: The Golden Age**

[Fresh Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/FreshPrecure-OP1.webm) - Momozono Love is Cure Peach in what would become the first modern Precure series. So much of the formula and tropes that have become mainstays in the franchise even to this day get their start in this installment.

[Heartcatch Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/HeartcatchPrecure-OP1.webm) - Hanasaki Tsubomi is Cure Blossom in the GOAT series. This more mature and action packed series would become the franchise’s most successful series ever.

[Suite Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/SuitePrecure-OP1.webm) - Hojo Hibiki and Minamino Kanade, a couple of former best friends who had a falling out, are forced to work together as Cure Melody and Cure Rhythm in this music themed adventure.

[Smile Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/SmilePrecure-OP1.webm) - Hoshizora Miyuki is Cure Happy in one of the most light hearted, funny, and weird installments in the franchise. This season was given a 4kids style dub by Netflix as the ‘Glitter Force.”

[DokiDoki Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/DokiDokiPrecure-OP1.webm) - Aida Mana is Cure Heart, the Chad Pink who builds the largest harem of girls in the franchise in an installment that has a tighter plot and less filler than other Precure series. This season was also cursed by Netflix with a 4kids style dub as “Glitter Force DokiDoki,”

[Happiness Charge Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/HappinessChargePrecure-OP1.webm) Aino Megumi is Cure Lovely in a series celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the franchise by bringing back the director of Heartcatch Precure, Tatsuya Nagamine, for another action packed adventure.

[Go! Princess Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/GoPrincessPrecure-OP1.webm) - Haruno Haruka is Cure Flora in the second GOAT with some of the best character development in the franchise. Widely considered one of the best in the franchise, this series had low sales that resulted in the end of the Golden Age.

**2016-Present: Modern Age**

[Witchy Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/MahoutsukaiPrecure-OP1.webm) - Asahina Mirai and Izayoi Riko are Cure Miracle and Cure Magical as they travel to the magic world and attend Not-Hogwarts where they learn how to become witches in a series that has some of the highest Yuri subtext levels in the franchise. In a lot of ways this series is the spiritual successor to Futari wa Precure. A look at what Futari wa Precure would have been like if it was made in the present Precure Model.

[KiraKira Precure a la Mode](https://v.animethemes.moe/KiraKiraPrecure-OP1.webm) - Usami Ichika is Cure Whip in what is Not-TokyoMewMew. It’s the other series of 5 animal themed Magical Girls that also work in a café that doubles as their secret hideout. This season is available to watch on Crunchyroll.

[HUGtto Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/HugttoPrecure-OP1-NCBD1080.webm) - Nono Hana is Cure Yell as they celebrate the franchise 15th Anniversary by bringing the highly regarded magical girl alumni director Junichi Sato (Sailor Moon, Princess Tutu, Aria, Ojamajo Doremi) for a bold and progressive installment that was r/anime’s 2019 AOTY. 

[Star Twinkle Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/StarTwinklePrecure-OP1.webm) - Hoshina Hikaru is Cure Star in this imaginative adventure that takes Precure to the far reaches of outer space. The light heartedness and fun of Smile Precure with the Yuri subtext of Witchy Precure.

[Healin Good Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/HealinGoodPrecure-OP1.webm) - Hanadera Nodoka is Cure Grace in this doctor and health themed series that, ironically, came out right as Covid shut down the world. This season is available to watch on Crunchyroll.

[Tropical Rouge Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/TropicalRougePrecure-OP1.webm) - Natsuumi Manatsu is Cure Summer, the first non-Pink lead in Precure since Cure Black in Futari wa Precure. Tropical Rouge is a very fun and zany Precure series. This season is available to watch on Crunchyroll

[Delicious Smile Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/DeliciousPartyPrecure-OP1.webm) - Nagomi Yui is Cure Precious in a story with a surprising amount of mystery and plot to sink your teeth into. This season is available to watch on crunchyroll.

[Soaring Sky Precure](https://v.animethemes.moe/HirogaruSkyPrecure-OP1.webm) - Harewataru Sora is Cure Sky, the first Blue lead in Precure, in the current installment of the franchise set to celebrate the 20th Anniversary. Sora is a young girl from Skyland who dreams of being a hero land her in Japan where she must become a Precure to protect Princess Elle. It is only two weeks into the series and is being simulcast on Crunchyroll with new episodes airing every Saturday.

#We’re in the Endgame Now

On top of the around 50 episodes of Precure, Toei also produces one or two movies a year. One of these is your standard anime film adventure for that year’s season and the other is a [crossover movie that brings together multiple seasons of Precure.](https://streamable.com/8wl8u4) Toei have made 15 different crossover movies, with some only involving 2-3 teams coming together, while others can involve 10 or more teams in a movie! [We’re talking about over 50 magical girls in a single 60 minute movie!](https://v.animethemes.moe/PrecureAllStarsMemories-ED1.webm)

#Conclusion

I can understand the trepidation of starting a franchise like Precure. It can be intimidating to start any franchise that is approaching 1000 episodes of anime. 

That’s why I want to stress that at the end of the day a sizable part of the audience for this series is still young children. Young children who by and large haven’t been following the franchise since 2004’s Futari wa Precure, you know, cause they weren’t born yet. Many of the kids watching Precure today haven’t seen the majority of Precure series. Toei doesn’t expect their parents to make their children go through all 900 episodes before starting SkyCure. That is not the way the staff at Toei expect this series to be consumed, so I hope you don’t feel pressured by that. 

Precure has been around for 20 years and doesn’t show signs of ending any time soon. A big secret to Precure’s continued success and longevity is that the franchise understands it needs to be accessible and needs to constantly reinvent itself. Even after 20 years the franchise is still finding new ways to surprise its audience while at its core never straying from what it means to be Precure. It’s a franchise that can inspire you, make you laugh, be breathtaking, and just be adorable.

There has never been a better time to give Precure a shot than right now.

[Hirogaru Sky Precure’s 3rd episode will air this Saturday. You can watch the series on Crunchyroll Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G0XHWM55N/soaring-sky-pretty-cure)",lilyvess,55,121,0.93

After reading lots of new gen dark shounen I got bored of this genre since I found this trope so edgy for my taste. So I dropped jjk midway. I didn't have any plan to watch 0 but my friend kinda forced me to go with him in the theatre. And I really liked the movie. It might be a great standalone movie even for those who aren't even familiar with jjk. I don't know how many of you guys agree with me but I personally found Zero better than the actual jjk series.,Fantastic_Mood_4652,3,0,0.33

* **Comment of the Week**

This week's highlight is from u/Torque-A:

> My favorite part of the episode was when Jolyne went “it’s möbing time” and totally Möbius stripped in front of Pucci
> 
> But seriously, this episode hit all the hallmarks of peak Jojo. Annasui somehow Diver Downing a corpse to look exactly like him, Pucci scrunching his face to avoid a punch and walking around to build up gravity, Jolyne being so menacing that she only appears as her arms… it was beautiful.
> 
> One thing I did like was the reversal of how Part 3 ended. We have someone who stops time to kill another person, and they manage to overcome the time stop and escape… and it’s not Jotaro this time.

* **Meme of the Week**

GoldenSpermShower makes a return this week! [Pay attention in school, guys.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitPostCrusaders/comments/113o61g/school_is_useful_after_all/)

I was a bit confused at first but understood the meme format through the comments, which are just as hilarious by the way. Do be warned though, there's a slight spoiler in the third comment of the top thread, so skip that one if you want.

**How do I make memes/What do I meme about? Where do I submit them?**

Just make whatever you want, as long as it's relevant to Stone Ocean in some way. Extra points if your meme is relevant to the current episode/arc. *Always remember, a bad attempt is still way better than no attempt at all!* Go nuts! Make the worst shitpost the world has ever seen! We're counting on you :)

For submissions, just include a link to your meme in your comment either as a post on r/ShitPostCrusaders or on Imgur. Good luck, and happy shitposting!

601,"Modern anime creators, in general, lack vision.",114q6pw,"Basically, what I said above. It is going to be a long  and opinionated rant, so please bear bear with me. Thank you in advance. As the title suggests, modern anime creators lack vision and creativity. Back in the old days, most anime creators had an approach of filmmaker. These days, they feel like they are making mundane K-dramas as if they are trying to just finish it. Their is no passion behind it. 

First comes cinematography, which is perhaps one of the biggest weaknesses of anime these days. All of them look flashy and vibrant in color and make the scene hype as possible, irrespective of what the source material demands. Take an example of One Piece's recent episode, episode 1051 with Luffy and Kaido's clash. Though it was technically great with amazing animation and great sound design but it felt cheesy and exaggerated (most of the Luffy fights feel from New World feel that way) compared to Luffy vs. Crocodile's climax, which coupled with New World Symphony and those movies like closing shots from that episode, felt straight out of an epic despite having weaker animation.

Another thing that lacks is good osts and their placement in the show. A lot of times, osts are generic with OP and ED (basically J-Pop. Now, I have no problem with Japanese singers. But I am pretty sure they must have Japanese rock bands like Max The Harmone, hip hop artists, and much more variety in music apart from the same autotuned stuff) out of sync with tone and themes of anime (B the Beginning, Chainsaw Man and Devilman Crybaby are few of the very short list of modern anime which actually have great ost, OP and EDin perfect sync with the show.)  And sometime the ost is either a mix bag (like Bleach TYBW, some of its felt like it belonged to Fairy Tail rather than Bleach) and great ones like Vinland Saga but their placement is so inappropriate and sometimes it feels like they are lacking an ost for this particular. I will give two examples, one each from Vinalmd Saga and Bleach TYBW. The first one is from Vinland Saga. Their is a scene from Vinland Saga where vikings were raiding and pillaging an English with kidnapping and molesting women, a perfect depiction of viking mercenaries and their barbarism(vikings is an umbrella term that's why I added mercenaries after it). But instead of using a grim ost to show this barbaric scenary, they used an ost that depicted them as some sort of war heroes completely ruining the atmosphere and weight of the scene (scene which was supposed to show the cruel nature of medieval times and cruel nature of viking mercenaries. Don't take it as political correctness. I am just saying scene and ost should have been more grim. Take The Northman, for example. They had a very similar scene and how they handled it.) 

Another very similar example is from the openening scene of Bleach TYBW, episode 7. In which there was a confrontation shown between Quincies led by Yhwach and the very first Gotei 13 led by Yamamoto. Scene was full of carnage, chaos, bloodshed, bloodlust with criminals going against destroyers. But the ost they used sounded like not only sounded like it belonged to Fairy Tail but made the scene look it same similar to a Battle Royale from Grand Magic Games with Makarov leading the charge, with Makarov replaced by Yamamoto in this case.

There are other things like the structure of the scene, but these two, in my opinion, are the biggest issues with modern anime creators in general. It makes the majority of anime look bland or cheesy. And even if they are great, they feel lacking or less gritty than they should be. Anyway, this is just my opinion.",AbCi16,26,0,0.21

612,FMAB or AOT? Anime only,114hazj,"*Strictly anime, no manga, and NO SPOILERS*

Just curious for those of you that have seen both what do you guys think is overall better? I’ve just started the first 10 episodes FMAB (finished only the anime currently out for AOT) and I think it’s a lot slower than the beginning of AOT. I’m gonna give it at least like 20 episodes but it hasn’t hooked like AOT did, despite that most rankings on critic sites or list have FMAB much higher than AOT and even on a few all tv show top 100 lists. However I’ve noticed that a lot of the audience lists like on old Reddit posts and IMBD have AOT higher than FMAB. I also recognize that maybe it’s because AOT s4(which is by far the best season and Carries the show to all time status) is quite recent while FMAB was 2009 so maybe that’s why some critics rate FMAB higher. 

Anyways just wanted to let get opinions on people that have seen both.

613,Share an anime that you think is unknown,114gscp,"Can you guys share one anime that you personally think is good but never seen on the recommended list? it could be because it's old, it's not the best it their respective genre or from a genre / archetype that was rarely asked (I mean we've seen tons of recommendation for sad anime, dark/gore, etc). It doesn't have to be a hidden gem or something that is underrated just an anime that you want to be more known

For example I want to share :

[Gun X Sword](https://anidb.net/anime/2839)

Genre : action, adventure, gunfights, mecha, new, piloted robot, science fiction

Plot : 

>Armed with a metal sash that straightens into a sword, lanky swordsman Van is travelling through the desert, searching for the mysterious clawed man who killed his bride. Along the way he picks up a fellow traveller: Wendy, a young girl whose town he saves from bandits by summoning a mecha with his sword.   
>  
>Wendy is searching for her missing older brother, whose engraved gun she carries on her back. In their mutual quest they run afoul of more bandits and villains, a mysterious woman named Carmen 99, and more mecha battles à la Wild West. 

It has similar feel to Trigun and Cowboy Bebop + some cool giant robots + interesting characters, and I think it's worth a try. It has some episodic episode and one big main plot

615,anime or cartoon characters who understood that they are not real,114fjod,"An explanation first: I always thought what would happen if an anime character would understand to not be real.

 Let's explain why: for example if I would reincarnate or summoned in another world honestly I would think that is possible that I wouldn't be real, I mean technically magic who is used to summon me is ""something that science can't explain"" and science is what explains our reality so if something isn't explainable most likely isn't real. 

That said guys suggest me if some characters exist anime or cartoon who understood that they are not real. One good example is Rick from Rick and Morty where the creator said clearly he understood that he is not real. I remember another character that everytime is close to the truth but it says ""this can't be, this can't be"".

I really love when something like this happen. Other characters are the ones in Re:Creators where there they talked about the problem not so much, I mean they said ""for us you weren't real"" but only that, where I instead would start to think: ""if some anime characters would come to our world I would start to ask myself if I and our world were real"". 

Another example is anime gataris but I guess they don't talk about this argument because if you would go deep and maybe understand to not be real, well, I'm pretty sure many people would go crazy. 

Although I think that would be an interesting interaction though. I really hope someone would really realize that to see his reaction. 

Not even technically smart people like Sora from No game no life, if I can call him smart realised that, he is believing that Gods want to play games instead of asking if this could be possible for real. I don't know what to think honestly. 

Although if effectively I would be able to talk with an anime character wouldn't that mean that he is real? This is honestly an interesting way of thinking. 

But that would mean that or he and magic is real which is wrong or that I'm not real also, and that could be an interesting possibility.

625,[help] Looking for an anime that may have aired in the mid-late 2000s,114bocv," I've been searching for it for years, and posted before, but I'm trying again, so I'm hoping someone may have an idea.

I'm looking for an anime that was originally a police series type anime. It had a one-case per episode type thing.

The episode in particular had the team investigating a politician and why someone might be after him. I remember the politician was well-liked for being scandal free. However, it was eventually discovered that the politician had a female lover on the side. But, towards the end it was revealed the at the lover wasn't his lover, but was in fact his transgender daughter. The daughter, wanting to avoid causing a scandal for the dad had sort of refused to meet in public.

I vaguely recall the politician had a picture of the daughter pre-transition as his son playing baseball.

I remember the police procedural team realized about the daughter while going down an escalator in the building the politician worked in. I remember that the reason the politician was found out about the 'lover' was because they were caught in a mercedes style van. The police team all had ipads, so it was a somewhat recent series.

The art style was similar to psycho pass(not Psycho Pass though).

I'm hoping that's enough detail to jog someone's memory. The anime should have roughly come out around 2005-2015 ish. I remember watching it between 2008-2015. It's not psycho pass, Top 7, or Top Secret the revelation, but it had the same sort of vibe to it. It was a scifi series. No fantasy.

Question of the Day:

What does everyone think about Ms. Mizuki?

&nbsp;

Comments of the Day:

/u/ToastyMozart [explained why Kero didn't bring this up until now](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/113b7ic/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_25/j8pb3ku/):

>""What do the cards predict?"" ""That it'll be windy."" ""That's what they said yesterday."" ""And that's the only card I had yesterday too!""

/u/Esovan13 [asks an interesting question](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/113b7ic/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_25/j8p4kpx/):

>So far, the cards and the cardcaptor system has mostly been internal. The cards escaped, so Sakura needed to use the cards to capture the cards that escaped. However, that means that the actual system itself is somewhat pointless. Clow himself was an amazing magician, so why would he need to create cards to do stuff he can already do, even going to far as to (create? employ?) a magical beast to guard them?

&nbsp;

On an important note, no unmarked spoilers! No jokes about events yet to come, and no references to future episodes!

**Clow Card Fortune Book**

**Today's card:**

**[THE MAZE](https://imgur.com/a/O9rX3Ib)**

Losing confidence. Confusion.

**Playing Card when Substituted:** 6 of Hearts

**Card’s Message:**

If you can’t make it to a scheduled event, and there’s no time to arrange it at a different time, take a short little break. Think about the following: Are you stubborn? Do you consider the other party’s feelings? Are you cowardly?

**Card’s Warning:**

Draw an image of the achievement that you desire. It is also important to listen to other people’s advice.

#Comment of the Day!! 

/u/Draco_Estella was on point today and gave some great analysis on comparing themes! 
>*""This episode ties in a little to what it means to be an adult, explained by my all time favourite Little Busters. Strength, and that is being strong to stand for what is right. Aoki, is weak. If Aoki thinks he has a point, then stand up to it. Reiji is a mad man, so Aoki runs away like always. But, if he is a grown up, he should face it and tell off Reiji, that he is unreasonable and an idiot. Scary, sure. But if you are scared because of this, then are you really an adult? This is one of the strongest points on growing up as mentioned in Little Busters Refrain - being strong. Stand up to scary things and work your way through. ""* 

/u/HereticalAegis had some great bangers to the non-reaction to yesterday's drama XD

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 

/u/Vaadwaur 
> The writing prompt is again the anime speaking to its viewers directly and poor, super sexualized Mimi is making one last, desperate plea to avoid her cruel fate.

Please remember that tomorrow will be a break day. Chill out for the evening before we dive right back in with the ova's. Do take note that you're watching the right episode!!

690,[Help] looking for scenes in animes where the character is reading manga.,113rc1h,"I’m looking for scenes where a character is reading manga with comics scattered on the floor, similar to this image -

691,We are officially one day away from The Familiar of Zero Lent In Violent Easter Rewatch,113rb01,"Hey guys. Holofan4life here.

We are officially one day away from the Lent In Violent Familiar of Zero Easter Rewatch.

##What is Familiar of Zero about?

Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is a self-absorbed mage in a world of wands, cloaks, and royalty. Although she studies at Tristain Academy, a prestigious school for magicians, she has a major problem: Louise is unable to cast magic properly, earning her the nickname of ""Louise the Zero"" from her classmates.

When the first year students are required to perform a summoning ritual, Louise's summoning results in a catastrophic explosion! Everyone deems this to be yet another failure, but when the smoke clears, a boy named Saito Hiraga appears. Now Louise's familiar, Saito is treated as a slave, forced to clean her clothes and eat off the ground. But when an unfamiliar brand is found etched on Saito's hand from the summoning ritual, it is believed to be the mark of a powerful familiar named Gandalfr.

Wild, adventurous, and explosive, Zero no Tsukaima follows Saito as he comes to terms with his new life and as Louise proves that there is more to her than her nickname suggests.

##Why should I watch Familiar of Zero?

Familiar of Zero is basically a pioneer in the Isekai genre. It set the template for what Isekai would become. It's also one of the first light novels to ever be adapted into an anime. It's a fantasy based comedy romance with a ton of charm and a ton of interesting characters. The series isn't perfect-- Louise is probably the most violent tsundere of all time and some of the series is outdated (Also, only the first season was dubbed)-- but if you're looking for a show like Toradora if it was less dramatic and more on the silly/ecchi side, I think this series is right for you.

I really hope you decide to check the series out. I feel nowadays it doesn't get nearly as talked about as much as it should. The series is a lot of fun, and I think if you like goofy stuff with a touch of seriousness you will enjoy it.

##Brief overview

The rewatch will span 49 episodes, starting 5 days before Lent until Easter. That will be February 17th until April 9th, with each thread probably going up 3:00 EST. We will be taking one day breaks in-between seasons. I thought doing this will make it less overwhelming. Also, I said in the past that the thread would be 48 nights. I was wrong, as not only would 48 nights mean the rewatch begins on February 20th, it's actually 49 episodes. I forgot season 1 was 13 episodes and not 12.

As for why Easter, two reasons. One, because the Toradora rewatch is during Christmas time so I thought why not play off that by doing the other Jesus holiday.

Second, you can't spell ""Violent"" without Lent.

That's it for now. Let me know if you are interested in participating. Until then, take care guys.

713,"Just got done watching ""your name."" and I am honestly stunned; Here are some of my initial thoughts",113ksws,"For clarity's sake, I'm still very much a newbie when it comes to anime. I don't know much about anything, but figured I'd have an easier time getting into anime if I started with movies as opposed to long-term series. After some initial research, I compiled a list of different movies to check out. The first which was ""In This Corner of the World"", which I had a fantastic time with. Following that, I decided to check out ""your name."" next. After finishing the movie, I wanted to share my thoughts about it as someone who went into everything completely blind and unbiased.

I'm still trying to process my exact thoughts about it after watching it, but my initial impressions are... wow. Just wow. Everything about it, from the emotionally powerful story, to the beautiful animation, to the fantastic music, just absolutely hooked me in. Seeing how everything unfolded between the two main characters, experiencing each other's lives and becoming connected across time and fate, it was all absolutely incredible. The voice actors all did fantastic work as well (I watched it in English for the record). Everything just clicked for me.

While I may not know very much about anime at the moment, I can still confidently say that ""your name."" is easily one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. If you haven't already seen it, I strongly recommend checking it out. I don't know where my journey through anime will take me next, but I can confidently say this was a fantastic first impression.",theTRUEchamp,13,10,0.59

Does Shiina really care that she finds it harder to communicate with other people, or does she not even notice that she finds it harder to communicate with other people in the first place? 

I'm talking about both random strangers around her as well as the people she cares about. I mean, I know that there are some scenes in the anime where she has a hard time conveying her feelings to Sorata, and that she'd probably like it more if she could just get her feelings across, but I'm asking if this applies to more than just him, or if she even really notices her unique problem.

I used to watch random anime on adult swim all the time and one night they played an episode, or maybe an OVA about a TV production team. This team was creating a TV show and as they are creating it members of the production team start to die off in freak accidents one by one. The episode/ova ends with the delivery guy rushing through the city to deliver the movie to the TV studio for broadcast. As he is on his way way to deliver it the last few members of the team die, and after successfully delivering the tape I believe the delivery guy dies, either gets hit by a truck or something else, I can't remember. 

&#x200B;

I feel like it was probably a story in one of the anthology stories that were popular but I haven't had any luck finding one that has it listed as an episode. I felt like it was heavily inspired by the ring and Final destination, or maybe inspired them.

744,Which anime from Chiaki J. Konaka is your favorite?,113c54z,"It is a no-brainer that Serial Experiments Lain is the most known one he did but there are others he did like Texhnolyze (one of my favorites), Digimon Tamers, Ghost Hound and RahXephon but he also wrote some episodes of Gasaraki (also a favorite of mine) but it does not count.

Although I loved Texhnolyze, I have a very slight preference for an almost unknown anime from 1998 named The Devil Lady. It is a 26-episode psychological supernatural and horror shojo-ai anime with some politics and conspiracy.

It has an old-school style animation-wise but the color palette is great, atmosphere is dark, a very good character cast and its story is really well done and is weird disturbing at times but they are highs.

Notes: It is not related to Go Nagai's saga, the anime has its own story.

I'm looking for animes that:

1) Has an OP MC (Required)

2) MC is fully willing and often used their OP powers (preferred)

3) MC used these powers for objectively selfish and ""evil"" gains.

Some examples of animes that fit some (but not all) criterias are:

Isekai Meikyuu de Harem O: If you argue the ""power"" to buy a slave is a power, then this anime fills 2 and 3 quite nicely, but doesn't really fit 1.

Redo of Healers:
Somewhat half fits 1, 2 and 3, but not fulfillingly or fully.

Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha:
Fits 1 quite well, half fits 2 and barely fits 3.

The Kings avatar:
Fits 1 and 2 extremely well. Fits 3 somewhatly.

The greatest demon lord is reborn as a typical nobody:
Fits 1. Doesn't fit 2 or 3.

How NOT to summon a demon lord:
Half fits 1 and 2, doesn't really fit 3.

Overlord: Fits all 3 very well, but maybe only like 70% full on 2.

I watched an anime when I was around 12 that my big cousin download with P2P platforms we used back then. It really hooked me by then, time passed and I forgot the name entirely. I have spent the last 5years trying to remember the name, and just realised I can get massive support from this community!

After some drama context, here we go with my scattered pieces of memory:

About: a girl and a boy can transform themselves into robots (or get equipped with exoskeleton). There was some figthin agains sth I can't remember, and a love story.
It was a short anime of roughly 6-8 episodes (no more seasons)
First episode started with a Formula 1 car race style, and the female character transforming.

That's all I recall, beyond a complete feeling of woweness that doesn't add value to the description.

No talking about or hinting at future events no matter how much you want to, ***unless*** you’re doing it underneath [spoiler tags](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/q28ulr/announcing_changes_to_spoiler_tags/).",Tetraika,38,15,0.94

4,[FMAB] Thе problem of the scene of Miles and Ed's first conversation about the guilt of the Amestrians before the Ishvalans in FMA:Brotherhood and how a similar dialogue was resolved in FMA 2003,11vu7cz,"I'm talking about the moment in the story when Ed and Al first meet one of the soldiers of the northern mountain fortress Briggs, who turns out to be Ishvalan.

I want to make a reservation right away that in general this is a scene, ok. It is controversial, but Arakawa keeps trying to bring the discussion to the positive side. Ed really says that it is difficult to establish a connection with ishvalans in general because of their closeness, but he believes that trusting relationships can be established between individuals.

I am concerned about the end of the passage of the dialogue that I will now give.

>**Ed:** *Red eyes! You're Ishvalan... But how!? I heard all the Ishvalan soldiers were rounded up before extermination campaign!*

>**Miles:** *Simple I'm not from Ishvala. I do have  Ishvalan blood in me, but my grandmother, my father, even my mother are of different ethnicity. My grandfather's blood runs thickest in my veins, I suppose. That's why I have this skin and eye color...** [Miles looks pointedly at Ed] **Your caused much destruction in the land of my ancestors... Amestrian.*

>**Ed:** *You Ishvalans set fire to my hometown, and killed the parents of my childhood friend.*

It's not even that the size of the damage is not comparable, because we can say that from the point of view of the experience, the feelings of Miles and Ed are comparable, because we can't measure it. The context is the problem. You cannot tell the defending side that you, being the aggressor, have also suffered damage, so you are morally equal.

Here, so that there are no disputes, I will clarify. The scene is really structured in such a way as to show that Ed can really withstand a moral challenge against Miles and that they are equally right and the only way to break the chain of hatred is to forget the grievances. I understand that this is a noble artistic task on the part of Hiromu Arakawa, but to achieve it through this particular conflict and specifically through this scene was a fatal mistake.

Ed could just keep silent or think out loud about what it's like to work in the army who committed genocide, but he literally uses whataboutism. What if it was another Ishvalan, who, unlike Miles, is not inclined to a conciliatory tone? Would the dispute escalate even more?

Against this background, it is interesting how FMA 03 (Fullmetal Alchemist 2003) handles this topic. I will give an excerpt from the dialogue between Ed, Al and two Ishvalan children (Rick and Leo), thematically related to the dialogue from FMAB.

>**Rick:** *Where are you two going?*

>**Al:** *We're going to go after Scar.*

>**Ed:** *If we don't, something terrible is going to happen.*

>**Rick:** *Will you kill him?*

>**Ed:** *Why should I?*

>**Leo:** *Because he's an outcast! He's defiled! That's why!*

>**Ed:** *We want to stop him. After all we alchemists, just like he is. No we're human. We want kill anyone.*

>**Leo:** *You lying! You hate Ishvalans!*

>**Ed:** [reveals his automail arm] *Are you scared?*

>**Leo:** *Not, even a little.*

>**Ed:** *Well... I'm little bit afraid of your red eyes. The first time I saw Scar on those library steps I was scared of him, the first Ishbalan I'd ever seen. But still... There times when our feelings are wrong. What your mother and father told you isn't necessarily completely true... That's why we all have to find our own answers for ourselves.**

>**Al:** *One step at time.*

Here's how the script writer of FMA 03, Sho Aikawa himself comments on this scene (source https://twitter.com/Hagaren2003). I think in this case the author's words have more value than mine.

>At the end of this episode, we see Leo and Rick can’t let go of their feelings of discrimination towards the Ishvalan exile. For example, they believe Ed and Al are cursed even after learning of Al’s true nature. At first I planned to have the brothers point a gun at the Elrics, and upon pulling the trigger, the bullet would ricochet off Al’s armor and hit Rick, the younger brother. This would cause Ed and Al to weep at their helplessness…but, as I thought about it I realized this could’ve made the story too nihilistic. So instead, I wanted to convey the roots of the issue through Ed’s words alone.

>I feel as though some might say Ed is “putting himself on a pedestal” through his “lecture” in that scene. But if you really listen to Park-san’s performance, you’ll understand there’s more as Ed is reminded of his own differences. He realized such feelings of discrimination are also inside him, through Leo and Rick’s hatred of Scar for being an exile. This is why Ed couldn’t tell them to “not discriminate” but rather “find the answer for ourselves” as he was also speaking to himself. I saw some reactions to this episode where someone said, “This doesn’t really affect me since I don’t feel any discrimination.” I truly feel envious of those who can say that.

I have a feeling that Aikawa seems to be trying to fix mistakes in advance, which will later be implemented in chapter 65 of the manga. This is exactly the intonation that, in my opinion, manga and FMAB lack. Ed here really admits that he is a victim of prejudice and does not condemn the brothers for the same. He doesn't try to argue with them or teach them. He describes his own experience and points out that he has irrational xenophobia towards the Ishvalans, but still tries to fight it. And offers Rick and Leo to find the answers to these questions themselves.

In general, I just want to say that although Hiromu Arakawa had a rather noble goal through this scene to show that even different people can find a connection, but it was done too carelessly.",Dioduo,4,0,0.5

**QUESTIONS FOR YOU - WEEK 10:**

>I didn’t give you a questions for week 10, only gave you an advice to skip ED7 until episode 80.

For those who did so, my question is ***""Did you guessed that Kyubei is a woman, before it was blatantly given?""***

When i was first time watching Yagyu arc i figured that one only due to ED7 Signal.

Also to not leave rewatchers behind i have an another question for them.

***""Was this arc better on rewatch for you, or no?""***

For me, i found this arc more weaker comparing to impact of this arc when i was watching it for first time. Also the whole toilet episode was more funnier when i was watching it for first time. But last two episodes of this arc saved it.

**Regarding spoilers:**

Rewatchers please dont talk without using spoiler tags \[Spoilers\] >!like this!< about events which still didn't happen in anime, don't name characters that weren't introduced yet, don't post pictures of characters yet to be introduced and try to refrain from using arcs and episodes names yet to be introduced.

*DON'T EVEN TRY TO BE VAGUE THINKING YOU ARE SO CLEVER AND NO ONE WILL CONNECT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER LIKE SAYING IT WOULD BE SHAME IF YOUR LOCAL POST OFFICE SENT YOU A BOMBASTIC LIST. JUST. USE. SPOILERS TAGS. LIKE THIS* \[Spoilers\] >!https://i.imgur.com/nojEEcg.png!<

There will be first watchers discussing it together with us and I believe nobody here wants them to be spoiled.

If you want to talk about something you noticed on your rewatch, which is hinting about future events hid it properly underneath the spoilers like the fact \[Spoilers\] >!that the information hidden in this spoiler is totally pointless.!<

**FINAL WORDS + LITTLE TEASER:**

Last two weeks brought us action, emotions and humor in a form of Fuyo arc and Yagyu arc. But before them, we had a week with every episode containing it’s own little story centered around characters as Yamazaki, Zenzo and Katsura.

Those who loved episodes likes this will be next week treated as **ROYALTY.**",Shocketheth,64,23,0.96
8,How people felt about CloverWorks in 2021 vs. 2022,11vtrnl,"So, in 2021, most of the anime community really disliked [CloverWorks](https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1835/CloverWorks) because they rushed [Yakusoku no Neverland Season 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39617/Yakusoku_no_Neverland_2nd_Season) and [Horimiya](https://myanimelist.net/anime/42897/Horimiya) and turned [Wonder Egg Priority](https://myanimelist.net/anime/43299/Wonder_Egg_Priority) into a convoluted mess.

Then, in 2022, a fair amount of the community began holding them in high regard because of [Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru](https://myanimelist.net/anime/48736/Sono_Bisque_Doll_wa_Koi_wo_Suru), [Spy x Family](https://myanimelist.net/anime/50265/Spy_x_Family), and [Bocchi the Rock](https://myanimelist.net/anime/47917/Bocchi_the_Rock).

What I want to know is whether or not you agree with the community doing a 180 on their feelings towards CloverWorks in the span of a year?",thealienredditor,15,0,0.38

(Vinland Saga Season 2),11vpy0r,"So me and my family dropped Vinland Saga at episode 5 because none of us cared about Thorfinn being in his feels but I keep seeing Vinland Saga at the top of r/anime ranking so I was wondering if we finally have gotten back to season 1 stuff like the politics, religious philosophy/discussion, etc.

In other words are we either a) done with farming or b) no longer hyperfocused on Thorfinn?

17,ain't getting romance anime like we used to,11vob1f,"*Tsuki Ga Kirei, Tada Never Falls In Love, Your Lie In April, Tatami Galaxy, Clannad, Golden Time, Relife, Orange, Kokoro Connect, Welcome To NHK, Ore Monogatari, Nagi No Asukara, Kids On The Slope, Kimi Ni Todoke, Josee And The Tiger, Anthem Of The Heart, Just Because, Ancient Magus Bride* & many more like these. 

But for over 2 years now we're getting romcoms after romcoms. I'm not against romcom. I also like it. There was a time when we used to get mix of everything - from drama to romcom, from serious josei to cliched shoujo. But nowadays it's majority of romcoms, rather it's only romcom nowadays. And those romcoms aren't even like Oregairu, Saekano. Those are either one of those teasing trope types or cringe plots (yk what I meant). I'm not saying that all of them are bad, most of them are enjoyable but it's repetitive at this point. I really miss those good ol'days.",Fantastic_Mood_4652,23,0,0.27

25,The Epic Adventure of Heroic Age: A Must-Watch for Sci-Fi Fans,11vjirv," 

Heroic Age is a science fiction anime series that explores themes of destiny, war, and the search for meaning in life. What sets it apart from other anime series is its epic scale and intricate world-building. The story takes place in a vast, galaxy-spanning civilization where different tribes and factions are vying for power and dominance.

https://preview.redd.it/1zycjj84rooa1.jpg?width=1311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ba379c15239f1d3d6fb611d9f7406ab98d46fdb

The series also features a diverse cast of characters, each with their own motivations and conflicts, as well as spectacular battle scenes that showcase the animation studio's attention to detail and creativity.

One of the most unique aspects of Heroic Age is its depiction of the ""Tribe,"" a race of beings with god-like powers who are responsible for the creation and maintenance of the galaxy. As the series unfolds, the true nature and purpose of the Tribe is gradually revealed, adding layers of complexity and intrigue to the story.

Overall, Heroic Age is a thrilling and thought-provoking anime that offers a unique take on science fiction and epic storytelling.",Katzblazer,4,14,0.85

31,Seeking Feedback for /r/anime's New User Experience,11v7wbv,"Hello everyone!

We're back with another feedback thread. Some of you may have noticed the announcements and discussion in Monthly Meta in [February](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/10tvdq3/meta_thread_month_of_february_05_2023/) or [March](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11ihlcb/meta_thread_month_of_march_05_2023/), and others may have encountered it directly, but we implemented a trial for a pretty major change to our New User experience on the subreddit.

Previously, Reddit's auto-mod tools gave us access to a couple particular data points regarding a user's account: The account's age, and the account's *site-wide* Reddit karma. We had combined these two features to prevent posting by accounts less than 7 days old or with notable net-negative karma. Users failing the 7-day check would receive an auto-mod message telling them to ask us for approval via modmail.

We implemented this check for a variety of reasons, all of which boil down to protecting the community and keeping content relevant. It cuts down on the amount of spam, toxicity, and off-topic posting, since bad-faith accounts tend to be rather fresh, and impulsive trolls can't just whip up a new account and immediately start shitposting here. The filter also had a nice side-effect in that it's fairly common for brand-new Redditors to be highly unlikely to read our (admittedly extensive) community rules. Many times, a post caught in our newbie filter is one we wouldn't have allowed, anyway.

A few months back, Reddit implemented a new auto-mod tool for us to experiment with. Now, auto-mod can check a user's post and/or comment karma *specifically on the subreddit in question.* With this new tool, we began a trial in which we retired our old 7-day lockout, and instead replaced it with a new check: A user has to have a meager 10 comment karma *on* /r/anime before they are able to make a post.

This trial began early this month and the results thus far have been... significant. There's been a rather dramatic decrease in the amount of new posts making it onto the subreddit, and a very large number of posts are getting filtered out, because it turns out that a lot of people trying to make posts to the community haven't participated in the community before.

[Artist rendering of people blocked by the filter.](https://preview.redd.it/lx6z2lexnloa1.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=05141a72425f268e80fa0d765f4b3720022ab613)

It's a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the vast majority of the content getting caught in the filter are posts that would have been removed anyway. Many would get hit by other auto-mod rules. Title or post body too short, direct image posts for flairs that don't accept images, TikTok links, outright naming piracy sites, mentioning onlyfans. Y'know, normal everyday stuff.

Then there's a significant chunk of posts that would have made it through auto-mod only to ultimately get manually removed for breaking many of our other content relevance and quality rules. Improper clips, short edits, off-topic discussion, piracy watermarks in footage, simple questions we'd hit with immediate canned removals, *someone asking for people to add details to a fake anime IMDB page that they made up in order to gaslight their friends into believing a nonexistent anime is real*, etc.

On the other hand, the filter was also catching more than a few legitimate posts in the \[Discussion\], \[Help\], and \[What to Watch?\] flairs. Proportionally, the amount of ""otherwise valid"" posts caught was completely and utterly dwarfed by the amount of ""invalid, even discounting the karma filter"" posts. But there's always the risk of over-moderating, and the filter is indeed useful, but it might be casting too wide a net.

In the first two weeks of the trial there were 4685 total posts made and 3836 of those (82%) ended up being removed. Of those 3657 (78% of total) were removed by AutoModerator rules, and of the automod removals 3329 (91% removals, 71% of all posts) were specifically due to the low subreddit comment karma rule. It's also estimated that 1765 of the low karma removals (53%) would have been removed by other automod rules if this rule had not been in place.

That leaves 1564 low karma removals (47%, 33% of all posts) that were posts that would need manual review. And so we reviewed all of them, at least giving them a quick look. From here on out the exact numbers might not line up because we changed our methodology for the second week (first week was all manual tallying, second with automated assistance), but the totals are close so only a minor variance.

Of the 1564 posts that wouldn't be removed by automod without this rule, about 142 (9%) were deleted before we got to them to check. Of the remainder we determined that nearly half (695) of the posts should have been removed by a human mod, averaging about 50 posts per day. 580 (37%, 12% of all posts) of the posts would be technically allowed by the rules, though many of those (\~20%) we considered to be of poor quality at a glance. The other 147 posts (9%) fell into a couple of categories: repeats where the user made the same post again, and an ""undecided"" group where it wasn't immediately clear if they'd be allowed or not.

Overall there were 849 posts *not* removed (18%), combined with the posts that *would have* been allowed that totals 1429, so that's a drop of about 40% of the posts on /new (excluding removals) with this rule.

# So, on to the current matter, and the thing we'd like your opinion on:

We currently have a vote running to make the comment karma filter a permanent replacement for the old 7-day filter. We *additionally* have votes running to *exempt* \[Help\] and/or \[What to Watch?\] posts from the filter, meaning those two flairs could be posted normally, by anyone, without interference.

Is this a great idea? Has the subreddit felt ""cleaner"" and absent ""low-effort"" and self-promo spam over the last two weeks?

Is this a terrible idea? Has the subreddit felt ""dead"" with fewer posts getting through, even if *some of* those posts aren't great?

Where do you think the ""barrier for entry"" should be on the community? Keep in mind that *no* barrier means you'll be seeing a lot more porn, crypto, and other completely off-topic spam until a moderator can manually deal with that sort of content. There have to be *some* ground rules or else this place will get real messy, real fast[.](https://i.imgur.com/0kSXhfi.png)

34,ONIMAI Episode 11 - Japanese Trivia and Nuances Lost in Translation,11v5qx2,"*For those that missed my previous posts, this is a post where I talk about some trivia on Japanese culture and some nuances that were lost in the translation from the Japanese audio to the English subtitles of the  newest episode of Onii-chan ha Oshimai! (ONIMAI:I'm Now Your Sister!). I'm using the subs from CrunchyRoll since it's probably the ones that most people watches the show with.*

*Disclaimer: This is only meant to be as interesting things that I wanted to share, and not as saying that the official translation was bad or wrong. Translations between two languages are often interpretations and translators tries to make a compelling story for their target audience. Also, I'm not a native speaker of either English or Japanese, so don't take anything I say as gospel.*

# Episode 11 ([Video format](https://youtu.be/1tY5ElYnOEo))

## Nemu-chan [0m31]

In this episode, we finally got the name of the blue hair girl that we saw a couple of time in previous episodes and was always sleeping: Nemu. It's a really fitting name because in Japanese, 眠い(nemui) means to be sleepy.

## Sagittarius [0m35]

A bit random, but the Japanese word for the astrological sign Sagittarius is 射手座(iteza), written with ""Shoot""(射), ""Hand""(手) and a Kanji that is usually for ""sitting""(座) but in this context it comes from 星座(seiza), the word for constellation and have a meaning of ""gathering""(集まる) or ""collecting"" like a collection of stars(星).

Source: [https://note.com/trapezium\_orion/n/nb5e6c3d0fb52](https://note.com/trapezium_orion/n/nb5e6c3d0fb52)

## Got you pegged [3m43]

When Mahiro reads the horoscope of Mihari that says that she should avoid being argumentative, he then said ドンピシャリ(donpishari), which was translated into ""It's got you pegged"".

The usual meaning of that Japanese expression is to talk about something that ""fits perfectly"" with the current situation.

The origin of it is not clear and have a couple different theories. One of them is that the ドン(don) comes from when a ど(do) is used before something to reinforce it, like in ど真ん中(doman'naka): ""*right* in the center"". And ピシャリ(pishari) would come from ぴったり(pittari): ""perfectly"".

Another theory is that they are onomatopoeia with ドン(don) being the sound of a cannon being fired, and ピシャ(pisha), the sound of a target being hit right in the middle.

Source: [https://gogen-yurai.jp/donpisya/](https://gogen-yurai.jp/donpisya/)

## Not to blow my own trumpet [6m04]

In the scene with the animal horoscopes, when Mahiro gets ask about his animal, before the ""big"" reveal, he used a Yojijukugo(四字熟語), a 4 character compound expression: 手前味噌(temaemiso), translated into ""not to blow my own trumpet"".

手前(temae) usually mean ""in front of you"", ""at hand distance"", but in this expression it as a meaning more toward something homemade, made with your own hands.

And the second part of the expression is the word 味噌(Miso), the same thing as when talking about a Miso soup(味噌汁). Miso is a fermented condiment usually made from soybeans but can vary a lot.

In the past it was something often made differently in each household, and it was a source of pride to have developed a good miso recipe that you could show off to others.

Over time, it became an expression more general to talk about praising yourself

Source: [https://gogen-yurai.jp/temaemiso/](https://gogen-yurai.jp/temaemiso/)

## We're under attack [10m00]

Mahiro used a particular term to describe Momiji and the others barging in for his birthday: カチコミ(kachikomi).

It's a slang term similar in meaning to 殴り込み(naguri komi) to talk about launching an assault or a raid on a location. But this one comes from the very particular vocabulary used by the Yakuza.

The exact origin of the term is uncertain, but it's thought to have originally been used to talk about the action of ""breaking glass""(ガラスを割る), which was often associated with the start of a fight when a group would go attack another one.

Source: [https://www.tutitatu.com/「カチコミ」の使い方や意味、例文や類義語を徹/](https://www.tutitatu.com/「カチコミ」の使い方や意味、例文や類義語を徹/)

## Karma [12m52]

Another Yojijukugo was used in this episode after Mahiro abused a bit too much his Anything-you-want ticket, but this time by Mihari: 因果応報(inga ouhou).

It's an expression that comes from Buddhism to talk about the, most likely familiar, concept of karma.

The first 2 Kanji comes from 原因(gen'in): ""Causes"" and 効果(kouka): ""Results"", or ""Consequences"" if we want to have something that fits the English expression. It's to express that your actions in this life will have consequences in your next one.

The next part is from 応じて(oujite): ""in proportion to"" and 報い(mukui): ""punishment"" or ""recompense"" toward something that you did. To say that your actions will have a punishment or recompense in proportion of its severity

Source: [https://study-z.net/100013983](https://study-z.net/100013983)

## Did you really have to contradict me? [16m17]

When Miyo says that kids their age like to dress up a little and Asahi directly says that she doesn't care about that stuff, the way that Miyo reacted was with the expression 話の腰を折る(hanashi no koshi wo oru), which was translated to ""Did you really have to contradict me?"".

The figurative sense of the Japanese expression is ""to interrupt someone"", ""to butt in"".

The literal sense of it is to ""break""/""fracture""(折る) the ""hip""(腰) of the ""conversation""(話). The hip is seen to be an important part of the body, responsible for a lot of the movement of twisting and bending the body. So breaking it, the important part of the conversation, would make it useless.

## White Day [16m57]

For those that weren't aware, in Japanese culture, the event of Valentine's Day is actually split into two days, on February 14th, it's the day for girls to give chocolates to boys, and one month later, on March 14th, called White Day, boys would give back chocolates to girls.

There's also a common saying that boys need to give back triple the value of what they received (3倍返し). Which is what the guys were talking about, later in the episode \[19m30\], when they said that the ""fancy chocolate didn't cut it"".

## End Card

This week's artist that drew the End Card is [Namori](https://anilist.co/staff/101553/Namori), the mangaka who writes and draw the manga [Yuru Yuri](https://anilist.co/manga/41593/). She also participated on the [Anthology manga spin-off of Onimai](https://anilist.co/manga/136495/-/) that a bunch of different mangaka contributed on.

**Questions of the Day, courtesy of u/chilidirigible:**

1) Given that this was a sequel movie with regard to the plot, were you surprised by how many TV series moments it brought back? (And changed, or dare I say ""fixed"".)

2) Context is obviously important, but have you preferred endings that have death as a consequence of events versus endings that pull off a last-second save simply to keep your preferred characters around?

It's about a guy who wanted to suicide and he found another woman and they decided to suicide together.

45,In dire need of help to find anime opening song!,11uyqzw,"SO, yesterday my pc crashed while I was listening to my playlist. It crashed just on a specific moment of a specific song. 



The lyrics that stuck on my mind were an ending note ""mugaki kagayaku""or""mugen ni kagayaku"", it was something ""mugXX kagayaku"". I know for sure its on my playlist but for the life of me I CANNOT FIND IT. I must find it, I need help, and for my sanity I have come here for help to see if anyone knows it.



Here are some important clues about the song:


* lyrics - ""mugaki kagayakuuu"" or ""mugen ni kagayaku"" or similar

* singer was male

* I would say the style is close to BHA long hope philia mixed with Naruto Haruka kanata

* I feel like it was an OP rather than an ED

and for the most crucial piece, it exists 100% in this playlist : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ne4kvjpvQDX7IgsTbtCE_9D9yTSLmX4d89XBmh0kFPU/edit?usp=sharing




I would post a .rar with the mp3s but thats probably against the rules.



I really hope someone can pinpoint which song I am referring to, and thanks in advance!",groovypixel,7,0,0.4

48,Samurai champloo is really good,11uvy7y,"I just finished samurai champloo and man was it great.

The hip-hop esthetic, the sword fights, that old but still amazing animation are just a few things that this anime a masterpiece 

I really love the multipart episodes that let the main grow a bit as a person.

Those episodes where a foreign language is spoken were also great. Primarily the Dutch episode was really great.

The final 3 parter was a great finisher for the series, also is the final villain voiced by DIO’s voice actor? It sounded familiar.

Overall the series great, would recommend 10/10",Geronimo-07,44,144,0.93

63,Lot of bad Gundam,11uq446,"It's weird saying this as someone who's seen all Gundam and who, if asked what I think about Gundam, I'd say it's great. But one thing I just thought was, for as well beloved and popular as Gundam is... there is a lot of bad, to straight up garbage Gundam shows, to the point where if the good ones were not as good as they are, I'd find it impossible for it to have the love and following it has. It almost reminds of Sonic in that a lot of them suck but when it's good it's really good so people still love it. Just to put it into perspective, here is a list of generally considered bad Gundam shows (yes you might like some of these but generally are considered not good).

1. Gundam ZZ (this might be the least bad one here)
2. Gundam F91
3. Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory (I hate this show)
4. Victory Gundam
5. Gundam Wing
6. Gundam SEED Destiny
7. Gundam AGE (I really hate this show for ruining such a great concept)
8. Gundam Reconguista in G

This list doesn't include things I consider bad like Char's Counterattack, or things that are so different I didn't feel right to include like MS IGLOO or Twilight AXIS but even just those ones alone there is almost as much bad Gundam as there is good.",peter123yeah,26,0,0.19

65,What animes that doesn't deserve it's bad/good rating?,11upvhd,"In my opinion, Sing Yesterday For You doesn't deserve it's bad reputation. The plot isn't even that bad and I can see some criticism that it's very slow and boring (usually sol came with comedy) but I don't think it deserve 6.88 on Mal. I think minimum it's 7 and maximum 7.6.

 It's super painful to read the top review of that anime that potray each character as childish and immature especially  the main character which the reviewer labeled as incel. But each to their own I guess.",smol_kaguya,61,0,0.13

68,Rewatch Discussion - Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,11umnr8,"When I first read the title of this anime, I thought “Yeah, I’m not gonna watch that.” A few months later, I decided to give it a shot and was blown away by how good the story is. I can’t decide if the series and movie are happy or sad though. At the end of the movie, everyone is still alive and meet each other again in the present. That should be a happy ending, right? Yet the process of getting there was so dramatic that I still feel kind of sad about the way we got there. How did you all feel after watching this anime and movie? I know that the light novels are still being produced and there’s now more source material to make another season or movie with, will there be more Rascal anime? Also, are the light novels worth reading? I’ve never read a light novel that inspired an anime but this show makes me want to check it out.

Note: Please no Studio Ghibli films. I am going to Japan soon and I didn’t get my hands on a museum ticket. So if the films are amazing then I am going to be even more sad that I didn’t get a ticket🥲",Born-Department7983,23,0,0.33

**Fae Facts:**

Shapeshifting is an absolutely ancient concept, dating back at least as far as the oldest literature.

One interesting sub-type that might be relevant here is the animal as a bride or groom -  These tales have often been interpreted as symbolically representing  arranged marriages; the bride's revulsion to marrying a stranger being  symbolized by his bestial form. The hero(ine) must fall in love with the transformed groom. The  hero or heroine must marry, as promised, and the monstrous form is  removed by the wedding.

**Incantations:**

You are a good lock, an old lock.

I am your good oil.

I am your golden key.

**Discussion Topics:**

Was Joel and Leanan Sidhe’s love a curse? Or a blessing?

What do you think was Ashen Eye's goal in giving Chise the fox form?

""My happiest moments are when I'm  reading the last page of a book. The story ends. But it makes me feel as  though it's going to go on somewhere.""

""You might see nothing but pitch-black darkness right now. But, you have to  keep trying and trying, looking into the dark world. And off in the  distance, you’ll surely find some light.”

""Life is a lot longer than you think.""

**Clow Card Fortune Book**

**Today's card:**

**[THE THROUGH](https://imgur.com/a/FE5ZBvy)**

The improvement of an unexpected situation.

**Playing Card when Substituted:** King of Clubs

**Card’s Message:**

The key to success is a change in perspective. When you change your way of life and thinking completely, it is very likely that your situation will improve for the better, and good luck will come your way. It is important to say ""Yes"" and ""No"" clearly.

**Card’s Warning:**

Even if a strong rival appears, face each other without tricks, fairly. They might turn out to be an unexpected cooperator.

79,Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt: Bandit Flower; It was a movie?,11u6w3k,"Mobile Suit Gundam Thunderbolt: Bandit Flower: I don't have a lot to say about this movie, it's whatever. I could probably sum this movie up in one sentence, “it was an anime”.  It's not down right terrible, it's still a fun watch. There's just barely anything that makes this movie stand on its own or adds shit that doesn't make any sense. I can at least say that the music and the fights are just as good as the last movie (mostly the music). So let's dive right in

* Plot: 
   * Months after the One Year War, a Federation sub group known as the South Seas Alliance becomes independent and has in possession the Psycho Zaku. So it's up to the Moore Brotherhood and the Living Dead Division to steal back the suit before they learn how to use it.
   *  That's actually a pretty good plot, I just wished the anime actually followed it. This is one of the few anime that has the plot told to us and it doesn't even follow up on it. All they really do for the rest of the movie is play music and fight mobile suits here and there. 
   * The MB or the LDD don't even encounter each other either, which is a wasted opportunity. Hell, the LDD don't even do much until the end where they have to get this info broker something. And to make matters worse, the South Seas Alliance, the main baddies of the movie, barely shows up in it. They don't even feel like antagonists until the last chunk of the movie, where they serve more of a minor inconvenience instead of an actual threat. So the plot is basically non existent, but stuff happens at the very least.
* Characters: 
   * most of the characters from the last movie return, and I'm just happy they're here. But the new characters….. Let's just say that calling them a mixed bag would be generous. They're not bad enough to ruin the anime for me like the majority of the Destiny characters, but most of them are undercooked and don't even add much to the story. But I'm getting ahead of myself. 
   * Let's start off with the Feddies, Io’s back and that instantly saves this anime for me. I'm just happy to see this Jazz loving son of bitch again, he's a treat to the Gundam community that people don't appreciate enough. His buddy Cornelius is back too, he doesn't do too much either, but his appearance is still appreciated. And that's it for the Feddies from the last movie I'm pretty sure, now onto the newbies. Bianca Carlyle also saves this anime for me, as she was a really fun character. She was charismatic and trustworthy, plus her playing the piano with Io playing the drums in that Groovy Duel scene was actually pretty good. I also kinda like the Captain of the Spartan, Vincent Pike, as he was actually a cool character and I would've liked more scenes of him getting his crew’s shit together. I also kinda like that core fighter pilot, Barclay. He seems chill and I would kill for more fighter pilots. If we gave him scenes interacting with the characters, he could've been a pretty interesting character. 
   * And then everyone else is useless. Monica Humphrey only exists to give exposition and not much else, and her manservant Josh adds nothing to the story. And then we got these 5 bozos who just exist to hate on Io for the movies. As for why they hate him? Well I can't tell you, because I don't know. The only one who actually says why she doesn't like Io is Alicia, as she hated that he used kids as meat shields in the last movie. Has anyone ever told this bitch that it wasn't his idea? That he was even disgusted by the idea himself. Hell, he was even willing to buy their drinks himself (non-alcoholic I hope). As for the other 3, Orphe, Harvey Dent, and Cosmonaut Marcus, just make comments about him and that's it. They really don't have any personality outside of that. The Black TriStars from Unicorn have more personality than these 3, and they had less screen time. There's also this blonde chick who does stuff on the ship and it doesn't matter. Not exactly a good start for the characters. 
   * Onto the Zeeks, and they're basically the same as the last movie (both in a good and meh way). Starting off with the returning ones, Daryl Lorenz comes back, and remember that powerful scene of him looking at his prosthetic arm and giving us that “what have I done” facial expression? We this movie decides to throw that into the trash. The whole movie doesn't even acknowledge that he sacrificed everything to beat the Gundam and he just goes on with his life. He does seem to be affected by Karla’s mental condition, which I'll get to in a bit. 
   * As for Fisher, he's still a good buddy to Daryl. It's not saying much but it's something. As for Karla, she's literally in one scene, and it's actually kinda effective. In the last movie she went fucking bananas after seeing her crewmates get beamed to nothing by a GM (like any normal human being would), and new has a mind of a child. I thought that scene after Daryl goes out with her, she calling daddy (not in that way), and being told about her condition was pretty effective and showed us how things are gonna take a while to get better. It would've been better if it was fleshed a lot more, but I'll take it. 
   * On to the newbies, there's only 2 memorable bozos here Ober… I mean Billy Hickam (who's also voiced by Todd Haberkorn) and his black buddy Seth. Billy is a cocky NewType who wants to spite Daryl for some reason and Seth being his Tolkien black pal who doesn't really do much. And honestly the names of the other new Zeeks are forgettable, so I'm not even gonna bother. 
   * And I think that's…. wait. Oh ya there's another faction of characters, the South Seas Alliance. Calling them lackluster would kinda be a compliment. These are supposed to be our terrifying antagonists (again, I'll get to that later), and yet they feel like an afterthought. The head honcho, Levan Fuu, only appears for 2 scenes. At the beginning as a kid spouting some NewType nonsense and the end as a baldie in front of the repainted Psycho Zaku. We don't know anything about him, we don't even know his or his cult’s motivation, he's just the face of the SSA and nothing else. 
   * And then we get to his followers. I'm just gonna get this out of the way, Chow Mein is an annoying character and is very uninteresting. Saxton only shows in a picture and doesn't even show up for a single scene. And all of the monks are your standard “bad guy foot soldiers units”. 
   * But there's one characters that had no right to be in this, Claudia Peer. Now 1st of all, how the fuck did she survived? Because the last time we saw her, she fucking exploded. People in the Gundam Universe survive the most insane shit. You can dodge car sized bullets at point blank range, but if the plot still needs you, you should be fine. You can have your ass, dick, and balls burnt off from an explosion, but as long as the plot needs you, you'll be fine. But this woman was shot in the admin, which pierced her normal suit, and then she was sucked into the vacuum of space with NO OXYGEN. I wouldn't even be mad if it's just the plot armor, I'm mainly mad cuz they brought her back for NO REASON. She barely does anything outside of making Io & Bianca join the fight, which I'm pretty sure was gonna happen anyways, making her inclusion all the more meaningless. What's worse is that Cherami is given next to nothing for this movie, so her acting is not as impactful. You had my girl Asuna acting her Kuchi off in the last movie and now you're basically made her a background character. 
   * Overall the characters are a hit or miss. Some of them made the movie 10% better, some aren't giving as much but makes the most out of their appearance, while others make Aqua look more useful. Honestly, some of the characters could be cut out of the movie and it barely changes anything. 
* World building: 
   * Ok, the world building is actually not half bad. For one, we got to see more of what was going on during the battle of A Baou Qu. We see the Feddies breaking into the base, Io and the boys breaking out of prison, Bianca fending off against a Baow Bro, and so on. I'm not sure if it's even canon or not, but I'll take it.
   *  I can also appreciate that it's another Gundam anime that's set before Zeta, but not during the One Year War. But we don't really see a whole lot. We do see Sydney after the Colony Drop, but not much else. 
   * One thing that always got me curious was Daryl and Karla's “date”. In a scene after a funeral from the fight in the snow (which was a really good scene), we see them hang out in some sort of forest with a small family who gave them a jar of honey and some toast to go with that. And then they head back to the Zeonic base. And I don't mean they catched a ride there, the entrance was part of the forest. So it makes me wonder, was the whole forest fabricated or did the owner of said forest allow Zeonic soldiers to build a base on his property. The former seem a little too much just for Karla's mental condition. I know she's the only one with any vital information on the Reuse Psycho Device, but it seems like a lot just to get her memory back, especially with the amount of resources they would need for that. And if it's the latter, would the landowner be chill with the Zeeks controlling his property? Sure, he could be a Zeonic sympathizer, but he's already risking a lot for a group that isn't even compensating him. It's a good scene, don't get me wrong. I'm just curious, that's all.
   * But the one thing that could've saved the story, is the lore of the South Seas Alliance. These guys are A FUCKING CULT OF MIND CONTROLLING MONKS, How can't you make them good antagonists. Especially with how they're presented in the beginning, with them salvaging damaged mobile suits and ships while burning the corpses of the dead pilots. These guys would have served as terrifying villains, but then the movie forgets about them till the end. 
   * But the one thing I stay consistently good throughout these movies is absolutely the music. Groovy Duel, Hone Kudakete, more great bangers with Japanese names I can't remember, Thunderbolt definitely has the best OST out of any Gundam series, as it absolutely carries the movie. Their music is definitely filling up my playlist. The best of the music was during the aftermath of the snow fight. No dialogue, no sound effects, just a slowed down version of groovy duel playing in the background while our characters are cleaning up the mess and mourning the loss of their comrades. 
   * The world building is not half bad, but it could use a little work. It would've been a little better if it had some form of connecting tissue with Stardust memory (or at the very least, make some references), since they're 3 yrs apart. Overall, I was a little more invested in the world building than the actual story.
* Mobile Suits: 
   * Another thing that's luckily preserved in the sequel, are the mobile suits. Although there's not really any returning mobile suits (which can be a good or bad thing, depending on you), there's a good variety on both sides. But before I get to the suits, I want to talk about the vehicles. I don't typically care about them since the main focus are the mobile suits, I do like how they're presented. Especially when it came to the Core Fighter and Corvette Booster. That dogfight at the beginning with the Dopps was great. And then the Corvette Booster working in tandem with the GM was cool too. 
   * Now on to the main course meal. The Federation has a pretty good roaster, start off with the main Gundam itself, the Atlas. It looks good. Io always get the best toys, as this amphibious baby comes with a Rail gun, shield that shoots out bubble gum, an assault rifle, and the jack of all trades Duel wielding beam sabers. We need more MS with Rail-guns, cuz DAMN this thing packs a punch. And since its amphibious, it can use both it's boosters and shield as a boogie board. I'm not gonna question whether it's part of the UC canon or not. 
   * I will however question the continuity on the rest of the MS. Starting with the Gundam Ground Type S, although it seems like it's a capable unit, it looks off. And I'm talking about it's lack of v fin, since those exist. For starters, I'm pretty sure that they didn't use beam javelins in the official UC, their shields are supposed to be smaller, they never operated in space, and… Ahhh you seen 08th MS Team, you got the idea. 
   * Same thing for the GM Ground Type C, because a.) The original GM ground type was only developed into the GM Sniper, Blue Destiny Unit 0, and that red one that's 3x harder to find than a regular GM Ground Type, and b.) Type C was only given to the GM Kai technically. However, I do like how Io uses this GM when his Atlas is out of commission, just to prove that he's a dope ass pilot with or without the Gundam. 
   * The Guntank got its chance to shine for a change, so that's nice. The GM Aqua Types and the Guncannon Aqua were cool until they got crushed by ice and got shredded by robo crabs. 
   * I should get to the Zeeks now, should I? The 1st MS I was surprised they brought in was the Zaku II Dozle Zabi custom. Especially since it was probably destroyed during the Battle of Solomon. Then it could've been a repaint, I dunno. I do know that it's never a good idea to reload in front of a corp of mobile suits, as the EZ8 taught us. 
   * There's also some redesigns of the Z’Gok and Gogg, the former being hard to handle until they get covered in gum. And latter actually be a terrifying design with a savage ass entrance as it kills a Ball pilot in a gruesome way. I was surprised they also used mobile armors like the Bigro and Grublo. They made some good fight scenes. Too bad they were only there for said fight scenes.
   *  And finally we got the Acguys, and they're certainly different from each other. In the beginning they just use the standard type. But once they get their mission to find their snitch, that's when they begin slapping a lot of shit on it. Daryl’s Acguy (the enemy search type) has literally no weapons. Just goggles, Eledore’s stick thingy, and a sensor arm. The damn thing already has 2 sensor thingys, why in god's name would you have another one on your fucking arm. Couldn't you switch that out with a standard Acguy arm that can shoot beams and missiles right? For an ace sniper, could've used the extra firepower. Speaking of which, let's talk about the rest of the Zeonic county bears, the Firepower (A&B), Heavy Firepower, and the Maneuver type (A&B, I was expecting it to be called the high mobility type since that's Zeon called all of their fast mobile suits). I can at least say that they're better equipped. Machine Guns, missile launchers, a rocket launcher they stole from the Hygogg, more missiles, a heat hawk, spare ammo, tripping wire, floating explosives, and a shield thicker than Rinko’s milkers. All with some actual use, except for 2 weapons. That dinky ass knife and a flame thrower. That knife is just a tiny ass double blade held with a wimpy ass arm. As the old saying goes, “don't bring a knife to a gunfight”. And then the latter, WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU USE A FLAME THROWER? There's 2 reasons why using this thing is stupid. You're in the forest with flammable trees. As we learned from one of these dumbasses using the heat hawk at the wrong time, any source of fire would signal the enemy in an instant. And secondly, YOUR OFF AGAINST WALKING TANKS MADE OUT OF SPACE METAL. Burning them with flame ain't gonna do a whole lot. Again, they should've brought some beam weapons. This a franchise, with laser swords and laser guns, and yet they used a flamethrower. Not even the “rule of cool” can justify this. 
   * And finally we got the South Seas Alliance, they only have 2 mobile suits. I wish these guys had a bigger roster of mobile suits that's a mix of Federation and Zeonic suits, especially since they're known for salvaging mobile suits. But their Dahles and Goufs aren't half bad. The Dahle is basically your standard self-insert MC in MS form and I like they use a mix of Feddie and Zeonic equipment. One minute they're using a beam saber, next thing you know they're using a heat hawk. I wish we got more mobile suits that can use any weapon they pick up like in a TPS/FPS. And then we got the Gouf troop. It's really cool to see them using flight packs that's carrying troops, it's cleavers and pretty resourceful. I also like that it's more like the Gouf custom with it's 3 barreled machine gun and electric wire. They even thrown in a bazooka and heat sword that actually heats up for good measure. They have the Psycho Zaku too, but it's literally used for sequel bait. 
   * So ya, the roster ain't bad, I'm just hoping some of these would end up in GBO2 eventually since we got the GM Ground Type C with the Corvette Booster already. 
* Vertic: 
   * If it weren't for the funky OST, bombastic fight scenes, interesting MS designs, and some of the returning yet charming cast of characters, this would honestly be a mediocre movie. It doesn't follow the plot it gives itself, the majority of the new characters barely add anything, and it doesn't even it uses it's antagonist till the very end of the movie. Honestly the worst thing about this movie is that it feels more like sequel bait with that ending felt shoehorned in. It wouldn't be that bad if a sequel actually followed suit. Especially if considered that this came out a 6 FUCKING YEARS AGO. And December Sky came out a year before it, making us wonder where the hell is that next movie? The manga these movies are based on are still ongoing. As for whether or not the 3rd will be made, there's been many conflicting reasoning on why it hasn't been made yet. Whether it be the creator’s health issues or they're waiting for more Gundam content to come out. If the 3rd movie comes out and it sucks ass, I think I'm gonna lose it. So ya, not Destiny levels of bad, but not really good enough to stand toe to toe with it's predecessor. 7/10, it's certainly is an anime.",Yakuza-wolf_kiwami,3,0,0.5
80,[WT!] Liked Everything Everywhere all at Once? Watch Mawaru Penguindrum,11u6v3o,"I haven't seen posts like this before on the sub but I recently watched Everything Everywhere all at Once (EEAAO) after its success at the Oscars and really enjoyed it, especially since I thought it was so similar to Penguindrum, one of my favorite animes. If you liked EEAAO and haven't seen Penguindrum, I highly recommend you check it out.

If you watched both, I'd also love to hear if you also found the two similar. I'll have a section below sharing the similarities I found.

**What is Mawaru Penguindrum?**

Penguindrum is the story of the 3 siblings of the Takakura family: twin brothers Shouma and Kanba and their terminally ill little sister Himari. Although their parents are nowhere to be found, they live alone happily. However, that all ends when Himari collapses on a trip to the Ikebukuro aquarium and is pronounced dead on arrival to the hospital. Still grieving over her death, Himari is suddenly revived after a mysterious entity within a souvenir penguin hat from the aquarium possesses her in bombastic magical-girl-transformation fashion. With this, Kanba and Shouma are suddenly whisked away from their normal life into a wild goose chase for something called the ""penguindrum,"" with not even the mysterious entity giving them any clues as to what it could be. Penguindrum follows the the siblings in their search to find the penguindrum and change Himari's fated death, all the while more and more secrets about their family come to light.

**Appeal?**

If EEAAO is a story of a Asian-American family struggling with a cultural generation gap told through the lens of a fight to save the multiverse, Mawaru Penguindrum is the story of a family struggling with grief told as a (dark?) magical girl show. They both have a very special way of portraying something very relatable and real in the most absurd, near suspension-of-disbelief-breaking circumstances.

Penguindrum has a reputation for being very confusing, and that is true. I certainly read a few analyses and re-watched the show before feeling confident enough to say I understand it. However, I will also say that some level of confusion is par for the course, and more importantly that not everything needs to be understood to enjoy the show.

[Look how vibrant and lively their house even from just 1 image -ep 1](https://preview.redd.it/2n8fytv8qdoa1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d38b1765e31d40d5bae9cea731063283562fba8)

The show is still visually stunning; with [top](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFNxfawS1jw&list=PLVf5K1ZCHE_9lKMP6VFS_zcQjsXqxSCXa&index=42) [tier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjecg5hOIgw&list=PLVf5K1ZCHE_9lKMP6VFS_zcQjsXqxSCXa&index=9) [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NHoUX0wxb8&list=PLVf5K1ZCHE_9lKMP6VFS_zcQjsXqxSCXa) and of course the adorable [penguin mascots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1OnjXW7W3U).

I think that if you keep in mind that, ultimately, Penguindrum is a story about the Takakura's as a family and their love for one another, you will get a lot out of the show even if you don't understand everything. Just like you don't need to know all the events that lead up to the snapshots we see of the many verses Evelyn jumps to, you don't need to understand every symbol in Penguindrum to recognize the beauty of the underlying story and its message.

So just buckle up and enjoy the ride - confusion and all. Many times the symbols just require a bit of thought or a small change in perspective like taking dialogue literally despite what the circumstances would suggest.

**Similarities? \[SPOILERS EEAAO AND PENGUINDRUM\]**

I try my best to avoid major spoilers except where marked. But those that don't want any spoilers steer clear.

1. **Humor**

Both shows have very similar absurd humor. I can't help but parallel the penguin's shenanigans to the stuff the jumpers have to do to verse-jump and the use sexual humor is also very similar. The famous [butt plug fight from EEAAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-gplbWy__Q) (obvious NSFW) seems straight out of Ikuhara's other show Sarazanmai with its [shirikodama extraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCFph_JYrTk) (also NSFW ). Penguindrum doesn't lack that same style in the slightest.

2. **Jobu Tupaki and Penguindrum's ""Fate""**

In both shows the characters struggle with feelings of helplessness after realizing their inability to change their circumstances.

For Jobu \[EEAAO\]>!happiness and sadness meaning nothing because she experiences everything at the same time. Even if she tries something in one verse and succeeds, in another it leads to disaster and her overall situation will remain the same. So she runs wild as a nihilistic agent of chaos and destruction. Her despair is verbalized as: !<

*""Just like the rest of your miserable lives, this is nothing more than a statistical inevitability.""  -Jobu Tupaki*

This is paralleled in Penguindrum by the idea of fate, where right from the first episode where Kanba says:

*""I hate the word ""fate."" Birth, encounters, partings, success and failures, fortune and misfortunes in life. If our lives are already set in stone by fate, then why are we even born? There are those born to wealthy families, those born to beautiful mothers, and those born into the middle of war or poverty. If that's all caused by fate, then God is incredibly unfair and cruel. Because, ever since that day, none of us had a future and the only certain thing was that we wouldn't amount to anything...""  -Takakura Kanba ep 1*

Major spoilers \[Penguindrum\]>!Ultimately, Kanba even goes on to make the same choice, joining Sanetoshi to do terrorist acts to destroy the world.!<

3. **Survival Strategies**

When I saw [this scene](https://youtu.be/uTcU2NQYZ9w?t=53) in EEAAO I couldn't help but immediately think of the [SEIZON SENRYAKUUU](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/fakz5u7bmgd91bf/peg1080.mp4) aka Survival Strategy sequence which often comes when characters in Penguindrum explain their various coping mechanisms. These characters are extremely unsatisfied with their situations, but powerless to change anything, must come up with ways to avert their eyes from the truth.

*""When I choose to see the good side of things, I'm not being naive. It is strategic and necessary"" - CEO Waymond*

\[EEAAO\]>!Evelyn takes it out on Waymond/dreams she is a star, Waymond looks at the bright side, Joy ignores all her problems and runs away, choosing to live alone. Jobu runs wild. !<

Major spoilers \[Penguidrum\]>!Kanba has his Kiba activities and playboy stuff. Shouma just takes it, feeling almost undeserving of happiness yet all the while feeling spiteful and unsatisfied. Himari is more positive but also lives vicariously through Double H!<

4. **Themes**

There is a lot in both shows about love and sacrifices that come with it. Take the scene where [Evenlyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmcyUtfmObo) \[EEAAO\]>!stands up to Gong Gong and risks her relationship with her parent!<commits a BIG taboo in Asian culture for Joy. I'd say it has major similarities to \[Penuindrum E22\]>!Ringo holding the burning diary to try and extinguish the fire,  Kanba risking his arm for Himari and of course the final Fate Transfer.!<

Both shows also have characters that ultimately accept there circumstances because with love, even trying times can be blissful. I think that these two quotes are enough but **major spoilers**.

\[EEAAO\]>!""In another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you"" -CEO Waymond!<

\[Penguindrum\]>!""I've been punished in small doses as a Takakura... but still we were together. We took all the punishments, no matter how small and trivial. They're all precious memories."" -Himari!<

5. **Surreal, extremely creative visual storytelling**

I think one major selling point of both shows is how visually creative they are. The verse jumping allows EEAAO explore, mix and match many different styles that culminate in this [amazing montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRvwwYlhH10) and Penguindrum also has equally bombastic sequences like [Seizon Senryaku](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/fakz5u7bmgd91bf/peg1080.mp4), and \[Penguindrum\]>!ringo's shoujo-esque delusions. !<

tl;dr Everything Everywhere all at Once and Penguindrum are both beautiful shows about family with exceptionally creative visual storytelling and similar humor. If you liked one and haven't watched the other, go give it a try. If you've watched both, I'd love to hear if you also found them similar.",smartredsheep,11,48,0.83
81,Looking for an anime movie recommendation that's not mainstream? I recommend: Ai no utagoe wo kikasete. also known as 'sing a bit of harmony.',11u62ul,"It seems to have flown under my radar and i assume most other peoples too.  I've seen the newer movies like bubble, drifting home, and belle.  And wow, Ai no utagoe wo kikasete blew them all away.  This movie is about ai and singing, and imo if you liked belle, this movie is very similar, but done so much better.  like wayy better.  It's very entertaining from the beginning all the way to the end.  It hits the feels so hard I totally didn't expect it.  this is just my personal opinion, but it's an experience I'd put up there very close to your name.",Isekai_Dreamer,9,1,0.54

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

Last comment of the day goes to /u/Lemurians

> That functioned well as a last episode. It's pretty fitting that a Wandering Witch's greatest wish would be see all the potential paths she could have taken, and didn't.

> The different variations on Elaina were all fun, though I don't think all were appropriately labelled. The ""loves money me"" was redundant with ""greedy me"", and the former would've been more accurately labelled something like Genki Elaina anyway. I thought Elaina's VA did an excellent job changing up her voice to imbue them with all their different personalities and make them feel distinct (for the most part).

> Our Elaina being labelled ""Protagonist Elaina"" because she's the one ""without personality"" was pretty meta in a way that made me chuckle.

### **Commenter(s) of the rewatch**

We got a lot of good comments over the course of the rewatch. You might have noticed I stopped replying as much near the end when my laptop started freezing up and dying on me, but I did read every comment at least once. At least the ones attached to the main post. Over the course of the rewatch I noticed three particular commenters that stood out slightly more than the others and really went above and beyond.

/u/Esovan13 with their constant trivia and knowledge from the light novels while occasionally mentioning the efforts of the voice actors and roles they have played.

𝓢𝓮𝔁𝔂 𝓦𝓲𝓽𝓬𝓱 /u/Elimin8r with their comparisons of magic and characters from Elaina to other fantasy literature. Also they were shilling Jack Vance really hard.

/u/Specs64z with their comparisons between the dub and sub of the anime and noting any particular audio differences that elevated one over the other.

83,HELP FINDING AN ANIME SONG (PLEASE!!),11u4j0k,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn8W37Ka3m8&t=259s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn8W37Ka3m8&t=259s)

At 4:19, when she says ""kitto"" I felt really nostalgic for some reason. I am 100% sure that there is another anime song out there, but instead of ""kitto"" they say ""zutto"". The straight tone stretch of the ""oooo"" at the end is the EXACT SAME, including the reverb. My memory is faulty but I also think the song I'm trying to remember has a few english (engrish) words, if that helps narrow things down.

The singer is a female with a slightly higher pitched voice and I think the ""zutto"" part gets sung for a bit longer than in this one.

I'm also pretty sure the ""zutto"" part is AFTER or at the end of the chorus, I remember it sounding really powerful and the song possibly ends (starts winding down) after this. The lyrics is based on love I think, but I'm confident the anime it comes from is not a main romance (could be main action, sub romance).

I will unironically **paypal anyone $20** if they can find this song. I'm sorry for the lack of information, but the part at 4:19 is **EXTREMELY EXTREMELY similar** to what I'm thinking of.

EDIT: To help narrow things down more, I don't think any of the famous anisingers like LiSA, Aimer, Reona, ASCA, sung the song I'm thinking of. Their voice sounds like Chiai Fujikawa from Rising of Shield Hero's ED 1 + 2, but that's not the song I'm thinking of.",lolman1312,10,3,0.66

That's... [a lot](https://i.imgur.com/iXES2iP.png). So let's cut the intro and go straight to the most prominent and most important aspect of *Show by Rock!!*. No, [not you, Shuzo](https://i.imgur.com/93ShoZe.gif), I mean...

&nbsp;

## ***The Music***

In today's modern anime industry where seemingly every anime is part of a medix-mix project and producers will chase every possible merchandizing opportunity they can think of, it's no surprise that most ""music anime"" have a tie-in album or two you can buy after you watch the show. 

That's great, right?! You liked the anime, you liked the music in the anime, and now you can buy the music from the anime! 

But it is just the music *from the anime*. If, for example, you liked the music in *Ya Boy Kongming!* so much that you bought [the tie-in album](https://i.imgur.com/bEh2QRq.png) you'll get full versions of all the songs from the show, and hey you even get a bonus version of the Azalea song sung by Eiko... but that's it. Some shows you get one or two extra songs from the protagonist singer/band that weren't in the show, but even that is rare. If you really liked the sound of secondary characters like Azalea or, say, [the Mermaid Sisters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-PWTsc0lC8) it's not like you can get an album of their music - they aren't even the protagonist band! What kind of anime would be crazy enough to have that?

Well, *Show by Rock!!* [is indeed crazy enough to have that.](https://i.imgur.com/GYlMqE9.jpg)

In fact, *Show by Rock!!* has that many times over. *Show by Rock!!* doesn't have an album... [it has a buffet](https://i.imgur.com/BmRgtco.png).

*Show by Rock!!* has [10 featured bands](https://i.imgur.com/aX5Inbz.mp4) spread across its four 12-episode seasons. Some of these bands might only play three or four songs in the entire show, but each one of those ten bands has at least one album's worth of songs that aren't in the anime at all - the fewest having 10 more songs, some of them having dozens of extra songs.

See, the company Sanrio one day decided to develop their own gacha-esque rhythm video game, and for whatever reason they didn't want to re-use their existing characters like Hello Kitty for it. So they casually invented dozens of new musician characters, put them into over twenty made-up bands (only ten of which are featured in the anime), and wrote and recorded hundreds of brand new songs for their new franchise. The *Show by Rock!!* anime is the tie-in TV show for this rhythm game, giving it some story, worldbuilding, and, most importantly, more exposure to its music.

The sheer size of this franchise's music catalogue is one of *Show By Rock!!'s* greatest strengths, and the anime is not afraid to put it on full display. This is not an anime that has the same two or three insert songs being used over and over again in each episode - almost every episode includes a new insert song, with a total of over 50 different insert songs across the four seasons.

Each of the ten [increasingly-difficult-to-pronounce](https://i.imgur.com/Ir5hvxo.mp4) bands has their own flavour of J-Pop:

* [Plasmagica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBB9tsn0eWI) mixes your the vocals of an energetic anime girls' band with heavy drums and rock'n'roll guitar.
* [SHINGANCRIMSONZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DhYEx9uHIQ) is an over-the-top chūnibyō-bishōnen kei band.
* [Dokonjofinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImEKmm0xcDE) is more metal-styled.
* [Criticrista](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJvUsHmp6b4) is your classic super-cutesy band of anime middle-schoolers.
* [REIJINGSIGNAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De0m_V_ynVI)'s leans into electronica and house music styles.

And that's just half of them! Like I said, it's a buffet - you may not like all of them, but with ten different styles and so many songs, there's probably something you're going to find and like.

Personally, I dig the shamisen-infused enka band [Tsurezure Naru Ayatsuri Mugenan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSMtgAa_mwM). Do they only get 3 actual performances in the show? Yup! Did I find thirteen other songs from them afterwards which I enjoyed? I sure did!

That's the biggest selling point of *Show by Rock!!*. It exposes you to dozens of songs by ten different bands with the promise that if you find something you like there *is* more to find, a promise not many music anime can make. And then when you do find a band you like, having a bit of moe backstory about the band makes listening to their songs more fun!

&nbsp;

## ***But There is Also a Story, Right?***

There is!

Shy, awkward, Japanese high-schooler [Cyan Hijirikawa](https://i.imgur.com/ulVbizP.png) has been trying and failing to work up the nerve to ask to join her school's music club for months when she gets suddenly isekai'd to a music-addicted world where everyone just so happens to be an animal-human hybrid (unless they're an alien... or a robot... or an egg...). After saving a charming foxboy idol with a talking guitar, Cyan - [now turned into a *literal scaredy-cat*](https://i.imgur.com/UERqjSC.jpg) - ends up joining a struggling young band where she makes new friends and has musical experiences that will help shy Cyan overcome her anxieties, learn what it means to be a true friend, and [become a better musician](https://i.imgur.com/vPfLTyM.png), too. Along the way they'll meet, compete with, and learn from a bunch of other quirky bands... and also fight music-themed evil monsters to stop an evil record agency CEO from taking over the planet.

That's the story for the first season, anyway. The second season has such a fantastic cold open I'm not even going to talk about it, I don't want to spoil it. The third season switches to a new main protagonist band - [Mashumairesh!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzsB2znN0c) - and drops the isekai and monsters for a more straightforward cute-animal-girls/boys-doing-cute-things focus. Then season four caps off Mashumairesh!!'s story while bringing everyone together for a final victory lap.

Don't let the isekai or monster-fighting aspects fool you into thinking this is a serious show with a tight, continuous storyline. Those aspects do add some over-arching storyline to each season and some drama to a few performances, but it's mostly just at the start and end. By and large, you could almost call this show episodic, and most episodes are focused firmly on either comedy hijinks or band-related moe drama or both. 

On the band drama side of things, *Show by Rock!!* is mostly playing things pretty safe, treading the usual such plots: [rivalries](https://i.imgur.com/O3j43OZ.jpg), jealousy, [band members keeping secrets from each other](https://i.imgur.com/za6CPd6.png), getting depressed after a big loss, [disputes of artistic direction](https://i.imgur.com/LmJL0Qz.png), the pressure of writing a new song, etc.

The show's comedy, on the other hand, is a mad, [mad](https://i.imgur.com/DiyFzuH.jpg) ride, utterly lacking in [restraint](https://i.imgur.com/VKlqWR2.jpg). Of course there's nothing that ruins a joke better than a review trying to explain why it's funny, so I won't try to exhaustively detail how the humour works, but in general it's the sort of humour that puts its characters into simple-but-silly situations, and then rather than just move onto the next joke it will [dwell](https://i.imgur.com/8k4P6uA.jpg) on the situation in humourous ways and escalate the situation even more... and more... and more again, into absurd levels of silliness, while making jokes out of both the scenario itself and [the characters' reactions](https://i.imgur.com/sDnalH2.png).

When the dysfunctional boys need to get a part-time job the show doesn't just go for situational comedy about them being bad at working in, say, a convenience store. Instead, it plays off their idiot tough guy personas to have them look for a cool job, which ends up getting them duped into a cartoonish underground mining job [with pickaxes and minecarts](https://i.imgur.com/FPNn8P8.jpg), which of course turns into a silly macho competition, and then of course that somehow becomes a minecart chase through an active volcano (and there's still two escalations of the joke past that, but I won't spoil them).

It's the kind of comedy where the creators thought ""Oh hey, if everybody is going to be an animal-person, how about we make a phoenix-boy who is perpetually sick?"" and sure, that's funny enough, but then they thought ""how can we take that even further?"" and made him a high school delinquent phoenix-boy who gets his own little [almost-a-transformation-sequence](https://i.imgur.com/nNIePf8.mp4) of taking his pills and drinking his health shake before he gets into a fight.

Or when the girls get put on trial for domestic terrorism with a cranky judge and their lawyer seems incompetent, of course that situation is already funny as-is, and of course they'll have the lawyer [do the Ace Attorney thing](https://i.imgur.com/gW0srC9.jpg), but then they'll also make a joke out of Ruhuyu interrupting the proceedings because she was just so eager to try out the Ace Attorney reference herself, and then the whole scene will divert to a montage of each girl imagining what their 40 years in a progressively more ridiculous jail setting will be like, and then when the lawyer solves the case [the courtroom will turn into a dance  hall](https://i.imgur.com/RtvE1Yp.mp4) because *of course* this lawyer guy is in his own secret band and he celebrates winning a case with his own insert song.

In short, lots of [silly characters](https://i.imgur.com/P1rX4Zz.mp4) in lots of [silly situations](https://i.imgur.com/ZPyZpfp.jpg) leading to lots of [silly character animation](https://i.imgur.com/H4zICAk.mp4).

If this sounds like it's a very ""campy"" show - yes! It is *unrelentingly* campy! Everything is [an opportunity for a silly joke](https://i.imgur.com/xlxE9qk.png) and every conflict can be solved through [the power of music](https://i.imgur.com/2smcmyt.jpg) (or else the power of mint-devil laser beams). Ultimately, that's what makes the show more  [charming](https://i.imgur.com/1bXrcju.mp4) than it first appears, and makes up for how the actual story and band drama is pretty thin. 

All the [cute character designs](https://i.imgur.com/oqzghWT.png) certainly help, too.

You might even find that all the silly comedy hijinks have lowered your guard, and some of the tropey band drama or unexpected [bits of wholesomeness](https://i.imgur.com/DlTNR5I.jpg) actually end up having a stronger emotional impact on you than they have any right to.


&nbsp;

## ***What's This About Edgy CGI Hello Kitty Sequences?***

Okay, I guess I can't avoid this topic any longer.

So yes, this series has some [full-CGI sequences](https://i.imgur.com/tGCkm2w.mp4). They're used when the characters fight the evil monsters, are *sometimes* used during the music performances, and also for [the season 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaoaMtW_wT4) and season 2 EDs.

Episode 1 has both a CGI musical performance and a long monster sequence, so it gives the impression that this is going to happen in every episode, but that's not actually the case - there's only a handful of monsters in the whole series and there are just as many musical performances that never go into ""CGI mode"". Even the performances that do go into ""CGI mode"" usually only do it for part of the performance, or intercut the CGI sequence with 2D animation, as well.

So why does the show even do this, then? I don't really know, but it sure feels like it might have been some sort of franchise obligation the show had forced upon it. The CGI character models are noticeably more chibi, making them look both closer to how the characters appeared [in the rhythm game](https://youtu.be/NLhNG4C3kDo?t=389) and to [Sanrio's other brands](https://i.imgur.com/VA3Dqod.png).

For what it's worth, the CGI quality itself *is* pretty good, and in the first two seasons has an interesting moving-playdoh sort of aesthetic to it (in the latter seasons they swap [to a more cell-shaded look](https://i.imgur.com/M7K4Y9O.mp4)). They do take full advantage of it in some scenes to, for example, zoom in on characters actually drum to the beat or finger specific strings along with the song. But the show has plenty of good [2D performance animation](https://www.sakugabooru.com/data/731df0d850235c9eb3703deaf196459b.mp4), too... and the CGI models have no mouths so they can't show much emotion or look like they're singing... while some of the 2D performances have [incredible singing animation](https://i.imgur.com/kPAeTHv.mp4), so...

...yeah, [I can't justify this](https://i.imgur.com/6sMxOQX.png). It's an annoying distraction at best and at worst will completely turn off some viewers. All I can say is there really isn't as much of it as the show's first impression implies.


&nbsp;

## ***Sub vs Dub?***

I respect the heck out of what the English Dub for this show tried to do - they actually redubbed almost every song in the show (except for the fourth season... possibly due to the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger?). A very, very brave undertaking.

Unfortunately, the Japanese voice actors are mostly professional musicians, while most of the English voice actors are... [not](https://i.imgur.com/UW8qATo.png). And this is a show where there's a dozen singing characters in the first season alone.

Furthermore, even with the English actors who *can* sing well, there's still an obvious difference in the quality of the recording - the dub still sounds like it was recorded [part-by-part in an ADR booth](https://i.imgur.com/VBlYBo7.jpg), not a full-fledged music studio.

I respect the ambition, but the best viewing experience is definitely the Japanese audio.

&nbsp;

## ***Is There Yuri?***

[Nope](https://i.imgur.com/DXOK6Kv.png). No coffee, either.

&nbsp;

## ***~~In Conclusion~~ Anything Else?***

Typically this is the part of the [WT!] where I'd try to make one last pitch or do a ""why you should watch it"" section, but I don't think *Show by Rock!!* really needs such a thing - it's not that complicated of a show. Either you find the idea of a musical buffet and [cute animal girl musicians](https://i.imgur.com/VjV1M1O.gif) interesting, or you don't. ~~Fluff~~ 'nuff said.

[The Sunlit Road Continues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUpNB0ItQls&list=OLAK5uy_nDAkIyY0GJw5m5IXCMVFMV_hrdL7kbW2c&index=31) by u/cyberscythe and a great analysis written by them

> it's missing the third note in the sequence and so it feels like there's a missing stair in a staircase; I think it's a pretty good metaphor for the sort of grief that Renge is going through. ([Compare against the less-sad version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l265CJ7e9r4) at 0:23, or the [much-more-jaunty full theme version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v94U8_XpCFM)). I also like how the full version is called ""Sunlit Road"" (陽だまり道) and the sad version is ""Sunlit Road Continues"" (陽だまり道は続く), which I think spins it a bit more into a ""life will go on"" sort of way

After watching the last episode it threw me off when she told everyone she was pregnant like i knew “Mayor” didn’t have that much willpower not to bang them angels vampires and elves. I haven’t read the Manga or the LN i did a lil Google search and our boy Mayor was busy is an understatement lol.

An example I can think of is the first OP of Spy x Family

If you listen to the song really closely, you might discover that there are actually 1 or 2 instruments playing that are really hidden in the background that you probably didn't notice when you were just listening to the song casually

I'm not necessarily asking for an OP with only a few instruments like the OP of Wonder Egg Priority, but a song that has the ""right"" amount of instruments",SuperAlloyBerserker,15,1,0.53

111,When does Durarara!! get serious?,11tex44,"Im on ep 10, and i wont say that im bored but i wont rather say im very much into it. For me there seem to be poor plot twists that i couldn't care less about. Also its slightly offending how they are showing serious topics such as murder and kidnapping so lightly, I DO know the fact that Ikebukuro is used to it, but still it feels like everything that is happening (even mystery aspects) have complete comedic aspects of it. Don't get me wrong I do like the characters and their backstories, but it feels like a fun anime which is trying to be serious but failing real hard, im not criticizing but im slightly disappointed and I dont see the hype living up well on the episodes i am on.

113,How often do you actually watch OP's and ED's?,11tel8d,I think when i used to watch things i would just let the intro play but now that ive gotten older and just hav less time i'll watch the intro/ending once per new one then skip every time after that. I think jujutsu kaisen and chainsaw man might be my only exceptions. I just happened to fall in love with JJK's first intro and chainsaw man literally had a different ending every episode which i feel like it would be a huge disservice to the insane amount of work that it takes to pull that off.

**Fae Facts:**

The Mayoiga is a phantom house in the mountains that is said to bring wealth to those who visit it, or a folktale about those who visit that house. It's been written about by various authors over decades, and there's even a mayoiga [anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32438/Mayoiga), although its rating is quite low.

**Discussion Topics:**

The library held Miura captive, but became a place of escape for Chise. What reason or message do you take from this?

**BTS:**

While trying to find information about the books mentioned in the OVA, I came across an original score written and available online by a man named Brett Heffelfinger, available [here](https://www.bjhcompositions.com/those-awaiting-a-star) and set against the OVA playing in the backdrop. It's a different way to experience the story, that's for sure!

Hachiman from OreGairu is another good example where analyzes the whole concept of love and relationships.

121,help me find this anime,11t8d1u,"So I saw this from a yt short a few months ago and at that time I found the name of the anime and it was quite popular, a bit old tho. But, today when I was thinking about it, I could not remember it nor find it so I know only a part of it and I hope somebody can recognise it.

So it was either an isekai or fantasy. And it has a annoying girl, cute, light coloured hair (white i think though not sure) and people thought she was like Aqua from konosuba. She and a few others were in a cave of jail cell I think and the MC got some food. And she said she didn't want any so the MC started to eat it with another girl. And the white haired girl started pouting and crying. It felt like a comedy to me and the girl was as I said popular and was like Aqua. So that's only what I remember.",Dangerous_Train796,14,4,0.67

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

First comment of the day goes to /u/AmusedDragon

> Oh my god Elaina(Saya) is in love with herself...? So nothing has changed, then.

Second comment of the day goes to /u/Esovan13

> I like the subtle way the show displays the difference between Elaina and Saya. Elaina is an experienced traveller, used to going to all kinds of places. So the first thing she did in the city is find an inn and put an ear out to the local gossip. Because of that, she heard about the potential danger and took measures to be able to sightsee without getting into trouble (though that didn't quite work out). Saya is a traveller of sorts as well, but she travels as part of essentially a government job, and she's been doing it for a much shorter time than Elaina. So she went straight into town, drawing attention by staying on her broom even when no one else was (did you notice that Elaina usually went around on foot except for the Country of Mages and Royal Celestia where it was common for the locals to use their brooms?) and going straight to do her job before learning about the city she's in or finding a place to stay. The difference in experience and purpose. It was there as well in the Country of Truth Tellers with the street fight where Elaina kept to the sidelines and used it as an opportunity to talk to a local and learn more about the city and it's people while Saya just barged straight in and broke the fight up without learning anything about the place or why the fight was even happening.

> Overall, I like the show. But honestly I don't love it. I just feel it doesn't have an identity. The world building has been decently lately with all the character meeting or going to the same places I loved that. But every town feels eh to me. Like they're not unique we get to a town all I can think is ""what's your gimmick? "" do they love dolls, or have bandits, or a wall, etc. They all feel defined by a single gimmick and not really lived in if that makes sense. Other slice of life feel they have a world and identities mushishi had an amazing vibe and creatures , girls last tour has a melancholy feels in a post apocalyptic world, aria is so unabashedly cheesy and in an Italian inspired world, non non biyori is so chilled in the country side. I can tell you about the world in all the these shows. We don't just go to different towns but instead we get to learn about individuals in different situations and towns in these shows making us feel more connected (minus non non biyori) to their world even if we see less of it compared to Elaina. Meanwhile with Elaina we travel so much but I feel we don't see day to day life in most situations instead we get a gimmick for a town Elaina solves it and moves on. We don't get many personal stories so I dont feel as connected to thw world. I like this show but I want a bigger slice for this slice of life show. I want things to be a bit slower so we see more people in town's living their lives out of something Elaina needs to solve.

###**Synopsis:**

Having a loving family, close friends, experiencing times of joy and times of sadness. These are the things that make up an ordinary life.

Kaname Madoka is a normal 2nd year middle-schoolgirl who lives such an ordinary life. Until, that is, a strange encounter occurs. She does not know if this encounter is coincidence, or the vagaries of fate, but two things are certain...

This is the moment when her destiny changes...

This is the start of a new magical girl story!

##**Why Should I Watch?**

If you were around for me running rewatches last year, you may remember me [praising the things OG Higurashi does right in spite of S1 having no budget and it being a bit lackluster as an adaptation](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/uhpw9s/gauging_interest_in_an_og_higurashi_no_naku_koro/) or [mentioning Mai-HiME's historical importance in addition to the things it does do right](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/wmvujp/rewatch_maihime_rewatch_announcement_and_index/).

My pitch to get you to watch Madoka Magica is much simpler: ***the show is actually that good***.

Or to borrow and repurpose a classic quote about *Hamlet*: The thing about Madoka Magica is that it really is very good, in spite of all the people who say that it is very good.

There are a short list of anime that I consider nearly essential watching for anyone trying to appreciate the medium as a whole, either by experience or by rep (yeah I haven't quite gotten around to all of that list myself, hi Utena and everything Dezaki).  Madoka Magica is either the first or second name on that list, and the only reason it's even a question is just how utterly foundational Evangelion is to the modern medium.  You don't necessarily have to like the work - heavens knows I didn't like Bebop when I tried it and that show is also firmly on the ""you should see this"" list - but IMO you owe it to yourself to at least try it and see for yourself.

The show admittedly does benefit from knowledge of its source genre (mahou shoujo/magical girls), which new viewers are less likely to have these days than they once were just due to the age of the genre.  (The ancestral form of the genre (often called the majokko show, wherein a young girl transforming into an older form to solve problems) is so old (mostly Showa era and thus pre-Akira) that most of its shows except the very late ones like Ojamajo Doremi have always been obscure in English-speaking countries (IIRC there were a few non-English dubs that were quite popular, notably a Spanish dub of Sally-chan that ran in Latin America).  In the early 1990s Sailor Moon took that older form of the genre and fused it with tropes from sentai (Japanese transforming superhero genre, usually a tokusatsu genre (tokusatsu properly refers to live action televised work with special effects, though Western fans tend to use it as a synonym for sentai) - Power Rangers is an American localization of a sentai show) and was a major smash hit, and aired on Toonami so was a gateway anime for a lot of Millennial girls in the US, and it is that form of the genre that Madoka Magica is drawing off of.  But Sailor Moon was thirty years ago and the other big magical girl hit in the US in Card Captor Sakura is 25 years ago now, and critically the modern 800-pound gorilla of kids-targeted mahou shoujo in the Precure franchise has never gotten a good dub, and as such Zoomers are much less likely to have grown up watching magical girl anime and learning the genre tropes that way.)  Luckily, however, while said knowledge of its genre is beneficial to appreciating Madoka Magica it is by no means necessary; indeed, I know multiple people who actually wound up getting into the genre as a whole because of Madoka Magica itself.

But really, the best way of explaining why you should watch this show is simple.  If you've been in a rewatch with me before, you may recognize my slowly-developed style of picking out shots that catch my eye and explain how they work cinematographically (usually paired with analysis and also theories if I am a first-timer).  The better the episode, the longer my notes tend to be; an average episode gets one page of notes, a good one may get two, and something really well-directed like Endless Eight 4 (the best-directed episode of Haruhi by a significant margin) can get three pages of notes.  And then there's Disappearance, a well-directed behemoth of a movie at 2:40 that clocked in at 7,500 words of notes.

... And then there's this show, because even strictly focusing on the cinematography (I did analysis *last* year and am not a first-timer) my notes for PMMM episode 4 alone this year are *over 10,000 words long*.

The show is *that* fucking well made.

(Admittedly our first-timers won't be able to read most of said notes until we are done because a lot of shots need the context of the full series to reveal exactly what they are doing so said notes will be hiding under spoiler tags.  PMMM's reputation for rewatch bonus is very well earned - and the staff knew it, they were going on record recommending that fans buy the BDs to see how the story changes on second watch *before the show even aired*.  So if you watched the show once, I highly recommend hopping in as a first time rewatcher.  You have seen this show once?  To paraphrase [Girl Genius](https://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20160201): you have not, I think, seen this show *at all*.

Oh, and did I mention that PMMM is on the shortlist of shows nearly guaranteed to be mentioned whenever the question of ""what is the best anime OST"" comes up?  And that I am doing OST integration writeups again?  (Don't have to do OST tables this time, though... u/Nazenn did them for me a few years back so I can just re-up his!)

###**Wait!  What Is a Rewatch, Anyways?**

Glad you asked!

To quote the subreddit wiki:

>A rewatch is like a book club, a way for the community to come together and discuss non-airing anime in a format similar to episode threads for currently airing shows, usually one episode a day or in small batches so viewers can focus on discussing the events as they go through the anime rather than the series as a whole in a single thread. They're a great way for new viewers to experience a series as well as any spoilers for later in a series are generally not allowed.
>  
>&nbsp;  
>  
>See one that you want to join as a participant? There's no formal process, hop into an ongoing rewatch thread through the links below or searching for the Rewatch flair and start discussing the series. Be aware that discussing events beyond the current episodes of a rewatch usually isn't allowed without [spoiler tags](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/q28ulr/announcing_changes_to_spoiler_tags/).  

How people participate varies; depending on the person, you'll see anything from live bullet point reactions as they're watching to essays to shitposts  and fanart to lengthy literary analysis (which may or may not hidden under spoiler tags, because while the rewatcher analyses likely will be judging from past years we're bound to get at literary analysis from at least one first-timer) to ~~OST tables~~ oh wait Naz already did those several years ago, heh.

That said, rewatchers and partially spoiled first-timers:  Please be careful about spoilers; we really wouldn't want to ruin the experience for our first-timers, would we?  Make sure to hide your spoilers under the “spoiler” option, or by typing your spoiler as [Episode number] >\!Spoiler here!\< in the mark-down option without the slashes.

So, interested?

##**Okay, I'm In, What's the Schedule?**

Glad you asked!  Especially since I am making one new alteration to the schedule relative to the past rewatches: *we will be having both a Main Series Discussion day* **and** *an Overall Discussion day this year*.  Rebellion is long (though it's an ordinary 2-hour movie and not The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya), and both the main series and Rebellion (especially the latter) benefit from time to sit back and digest them.

The one-week reminder thread will go up on April 14 and the one-day reminder thread will go up on April 20.

Episode threads will go up at 5:00 P.M. EDT each day (4:00 P.M. CDT) - that's UTC -5 for our Europeans, IIRC.

**Episode** | **Date**
---|----
Episode 1 | April 20
Episode 2 | April 21
Episode 3 | April 22
Episode 4 | April 23
Episode 5 | April 24
Episode 6 | April 25
Episode 7 | April 26
Episode 8 | April 27
Episode 9 | April 28
Episode 10 | April 29
Episode 11 | April 30
Episode 12 | May 1
Main Series Discussion | May 2
The Rebellion Story | May 3
Overall Discussion | May 4

##**Time for Club Activities!**

We will be having a few different daily activities to drive participation (though it's not like the show usually needs it):

- Visual of the Day album (pick a shot from the episode you want to highlight, or up to three in the case of Rebellion, and if I get five entries including my own I will put up an album of them)
- Question(s) of the Day
- Theory of the Day (for the first-timer with the most interesting theory in their writeup that day; these do not have to be correct, mind you!)
- Analysis of the Day (for the best piece of analysis in the writeups that day; this is open to first-timers but primarily aimed at encouraging rewatcher participation, and it is expected that most winners here will be under spoiler tags - something for our first-timers to look forward to reading after we are finished!)

##**A Reminder to Rewatchers:**

Please do not spoil the experience for our first timers.  In particular, [PMMM] >!Mentioning beheading, cakes, phylacteries/liches, the **ma**hou shou**jo** pun, aliens, time travel, or the like outside of spoiler tags before their relevant episodes is a fast way to get a referral to the subreddit mods.  As Sky would put it, you're probably not as subtle as you think you're being.  Leave that sort of thing for people who *can* do subtle... namely the show's creators themselves.  (Seriously, go hunt down all the visual foreshadowing of a certain episode 3 event in episode 2, it's fun!)!<

##**And a Word of Warning to First-Timers:**

Be wary about your inboxes, especially early on; people have tried to spoil first-timers in each of the last two years IIRC (via replies one year and PMs the other) and also IIRC at least once a few years before that.  (There is a small but dedicated PMMM hatedom out there, and I hear one of the most infamous examples has been active on Tumblr again lately.)  But don't worry *too* much.  After all, it's not like your host would do something like, say, intentionally coordinate with the mod team to use alt accounts to seed false spoilers as chaff for anyone trying to ruin the first-timer experience with actual spoilers, right?  Right?

In the end we get a lot of cut content in many animes because they want to fit everything in 12 episodes, or a 2 cour 24-episodes.

142,Do you think Haibane Renmei would be engaging enough for a person who hates iyashikei and slice of life?,11stfz5,"Title says it all. I've always hated iyashikei. I've tried as many critically acclaimed examples of the genre as I could, be it ARIA, Girls Last Tour, Yuru Camp, I simply didn't find it engaging enough. It's just the same shit happening for 50 episodes over and over again. I understood how other people find it relaxing but I'd rather watch an isekai. However, Haibane Renmei often gets brought up alongside Texhnolyze and Lain, and the latter two were really engaging and dense shows. Years ago I've given it a try but I dropped like 5-6 episodes into it - though the first episode was exquisite. Do you think it's engaging?",Dizzy_Opportunity861,18,0,0.41
143,Any suggestions from this season?,11stb64,"Currently I'm watching three anime from this season:

Tomo, Onimai, Tensai-Oujo magic thingie

I'm really enjoying Onimai and Tomo but Tensei oujo lost my interest in last couple eps. Also planning to watch Tsurune because of KyoAni.

From past seasons I've watched things like Do It Yourself, Odd Taxi and Summertime Render, anime that not many people talk about but are actually hidden gem, and enjoyed them a lot.

I'm wondering if there are any other anime that I'm missing from this season.

I've watched more than half of Vinland Saga and it didn't appeal to me so I'm not really interested in second season unless it shifts the tone.

I've watched 3 eps from third season of Danmachi and as everyone else it was mediocre and didn't continue.

It's been so long since I watched Bungou Stray Dogs I almost completely forgot what was going on and I think I didn't even watch third season.

I don't mind watching Isekai as longs as they have great world building or really deep character development, otherwise not really interested in watching one trope getting dragged for 12 eps while losing steam.",Kaname--,23,0,0.36

145,Trying to find an Anime from Childhood,11sngxs,"This one I’ve been struggling with for a while. When I was a child I use to live in Portugal in the early 90’s and would pretty much only watch Cartoon Network. I have vague memory’s of watching this anime where people have blue skin. Looked very 80’s based on what I know about anime today. Think they lived all lived in one giant rock city that that was shaped a bit like a termite mound. Rising from the ground. 
Everyone possible wore white clothes.
Remember the intro would be birdseye 
views of the city I think.

Have we seen any series with this premise used the other way around in this recent years? The last time this promise was used this way was for Kimi ni Todoke, IIRC.",mr_beanoz,22,9,0.67
148,Ergo Proxy deserves to be better known and watched by more people,11skn7a,"This anime isn't talked about much here, I guess it may be ""old"" for most redditors nowadays?

I can not recommend it enough, it's probably my favourite of all I've watched.

It's a thinker's anime, takes place in a post apocalyptic kinda landscape and will have you thinking about life, the nature of the self, our relationship with nature, machines, AI etc.

The art and music are beautiful and the plot is convoluted enough to keep you guessing and wanting for more.

It's produced by Manglobe, directed by Shūkō Murase and written by Dai Satō. 

It's 23 episodes of around 25 minutes.

Do yourself a favor, find it and watch it.

149,Just watched the first episode of bakemonogatori and i think I understand about nothing of what just happened.,11sjpva,"But it was interesting. I watch a couple anime YouTubers ( mostly giguk) and ive heard them praise the monogatori series. Ive also heard about a tooth brush scene being crazy other then that im going in blind.

Question: is there a certain way to watch this? Am i suppose to pause and read stuff? Ive looked up that bakemonogatori is first. Other then that idk

Ive got some guesses on where this is going  and i knew it was going to be trippy. Preferably no spoilers i just wanna know if this is the one ur supposed to start with and is it normal to not have a clue on whats going on yet.

Not Inuyasha, I recently rewatched the whole show. 

Are there any other anime’s out there with a king, consorts, romance and all that?",Massi28,24,2,0.6
151,Question about s1-ep8 of Durarara!!,11sijuq,"Question about s1-ep8.

In the first episode, we saw people kinda freaking out seeing Celty on her bike as ""Headless Rider"" and were trying to take pictures of her on her bike.

But now in the 8th episode, she's been roaming in the city and no one seems to recognise that its the same headless rider, she is standing in the middle of the city where people ARE passing by without noticing the person they've been seeing is literally in news as wanted (?).

Even the blond hair girl who is like asking people what are they finding has met Celty and Celty wrote her ""Head"" in her notebook and blond girl can't recognise that she can be the Headless Rider?

I really wonder if its going to be cleared up in next episodes so lmk if it is, or if it was cleared up in previous episodes and im missing something then please explain.

If you've watched DRRR S1 long ago so to remind you its the same episode where they show Seiji guy calling his gf with neck scar ""Celty"".",weishenmyguy,2,2,0.58

155,The Fruit of Evolution Season 2,11sfzv3,"I just have a quick question or two about The Fruit of Evolution Season 2 so any help would be appreciated. I don't care about spoilers either, for me it doesn't ruin anything and sometimes it helps my anticipation for the anime because with all the anime delays I started watching anime that's already finished or is on its final season. This anime though hits in my soft spot, I'm kind of a sucker when it comes to isekai lol. Lately I've been branching out more and watching anime from different genres or anime that are a little older so slowly but surely my anime knowledge is growing every day. Anyways I'll get to my question.

All I want to know is who the hell is Destra? I know she is a student at Barbador Magic Academy but it literally says nothing on her info page. So basically I just want to know if she will be a friend or a foe? Also what the heck happened to Saria? In the promo she looked badly injured but I'm guessing that's what was needed to unlock Seiichi's next level of badassness* ( *my own word ) and he heals her and goes on to defeat Destra who then falls in love with Seiichi because he is the first and only man to ever defeat her. I can totally see it going in that direction. 

Also I would like to know how his former classmates react when they finally meet up with him again? I bet the kids that used to bully him don't believe him at first and once they realize it's him they start to say rude shit and also try and see why so many sexy waifus are following him around and then the bullies try to convince the girls to leave Seiichi and join their group but to everyones surprise they all say that they're Seiichis wives lmao. 

Also I can see Karen joining Seiichi's harem too eventually.

So I'd really appreciate it if anyone can answer my questions, I really don't care about spoilers, all I want is to know the answers to my questions please.the",zombiepickle420,1,0,0.47

**Fae Facts:**

Second sight, or true sight - the ability to see the fae and spirits. Although in anime it is typically depicted as something you were born with, there are many stories in British mythology of folks gaining the sight through interactions with the fae, and it could even sometimes be passed on through contact with a person who had it.

**Discussion Topics:**

Did you have a special sanctuary or hideaway like that when you were a child?

**BTS:**

Like many names in anime, Chise’s has strong meaning behind it:

The name **Chise** means ""wisdom, intellect"" (智) (chi) and ""generations"" (世) (se), which literally means ""the wise generation"" altogether.

Chise's surname **Hatori** means ""feather"" (羽) (ha) and ""bird, poultry, fowl"" (鳥) (tori), which literally means ""wing of a bird"" altogether.

Episodes 10 and 11 are brought to you by...volume 5?!  What are you doing here? Moving past volume three and completely bypassing volume 4, we're taking a short visit to the fifth volume. Yesterday, I mentioned that the choice of stories was deliberate to create a flow for the anime. In that case, it was that Mirarose and Nino contained elements that was used in the story with Selena. In this case, it ties together the human relationships Elaina has.

Episode one was Elaina and Fran's origin, episode 2 was Saya's. Episode 5 was a reunion with Fran, episode 6 a reunion with Saya. Episode 8 we met Sheila and learned her relationship to Saya, and in this episode we learned the origin and nature of the relationship between Sheila and Fran. Tomorrow, all four characters will be in the same city at the same time, along with a mysterious box. But I have no more to say about that until then.

Actually, now that I think about it, episode 7 showed a glimpse of Nike for the first time with the wall country before her much longer appearance in this episode. The wine village had a similar theme to the wall country in the form of quarreling neighbors learning to get along. Plus, I mentioned Nino's story had similarities to Selena's and the flower country in the same episode had a similar role as Nino in showing the tragedies that can be caused by the magic of the world while Nino's showed the mundane. I never realized before, but all the stories chosen to be put in the anime adaptation has some kind of connection with at least one of the other stories. Huh. I think I have an even better appreciation of the adaptation now.

Second comment of the day goes to /u/redekj for posting...𝓢𝓮𝔁𝓲𝓵𝔂. 

> oh dear Lord I feel a new fascination growing within me. 

Also while not a comment congratulations are in order for the newest witch /u/Elimin8r who shall forever me known as(or at least until end of this rewatch) as the 𝓢𝓮𝔁𝔂 𝓦𝓲𝓽𝓬𝓱.

**Synopsis**:


*""Cute girls doing cute things in cute ways.""*

Everyday things make up the fabric of life—whether it's making friends, going to school, trying to make money, or celebrating a holiday. Ichigo Mashimaro is a heartwarming series depicting the everyday life of four pre-adolescent girls and their older sister figure, Strawberry Marshmallow (Ichigo Mashimaro in the original Japanese) doesn't have excessive drama, or supernatural events, or giant robots. Just the antics of five girls, two 12 year olds, two 11 year olds, acting somewhat cuter and funnier than perhaps is entirely realistic, and their questionably high schooler older sister. 

---

##Why should you watch it?

Ichigo Mashimaro is a chill out SOL comedy with close to zero fanservice (unless you think Coppola dressing up as a cute girl count as fanservice)

Yes, honest! Believe it or not but I don't only host questionably ecchi series!! I'm back to my roots for this one. After the mentally exhausting KnJ and the physically draining KissxSis I think we all deserve a break and to return to the joys of the mid 00's moe slice of life scene. 

Ichigo Mashimaro is a 2002 *Shonen* manga by Lolicon Legend Barasui who channeled his wise knowledge and craft into making this relaxed and chilled out healing manga about a questionable high school delinquent getting her daily dose of moe from her kid sister and her friends. It has spawned the 2005 anime adaptation that we will be watching along with a visual novel. That right, Ichigo E-Sports over here! 

Fans of moe, slice of life, iyashikei, and cute kids doing cute things will be right at home. There is some depth behind the show if you decide to dedicate yourself to searching it out but you can sit back and bask in the healing comfort of the 00's if you so prefer.

**Why Should I watch Golden Time?**

Golden Time is a romantic comedy set in college, unlike most romantic comedies, which are set in high school. This leads to the show having much more mature characters, and most drama is taken more seriously, and it doesn’t feel like a bunch of kids in unnecessary drama.  

The show is very funny, and it can also be very emotional as each episode feels like it ended in just 5 minutes! https://imgur.com/a/pjXFgfE",One-Imagination2301,18,48,0.93
165,Is Happy Sugar Life a complete adaptation?,11s6r2y,"I've seen people talk about it in ways that could be vaguely interpreted either way, but don't want to research too far into it lest I spoil myself. So just wondering if it is or if I'd be better off with the manga, thanks.",Zeke-Freek,10,3,0.64
166,Blue Lock’s characters are extremely boring,11s57r6,"Every blue lock fan I’ve heard from always praises the fact that there isn’t just 1 main character and everyone surrounding the protagonist has their own personality and goals. 

I disagree. They’re all fcking boring. All of their personalities revolve around their abilities, and not the other way around like in Ao Ashito where characters have their well fleshed out personalities and history on top of their footballing skills as a complementary add on. What about Bluelocks characters goals? Well, their goals are literally all the same, not a single person has any other motivation other than to be Blue locks N1, and that would be fine, except as I’ve stated their whole personalities revolve around their abilities. So what do you get? 

TLDR: A 210 page (ongoing) bland research paper on what characteristic is the best for a striker - is it running fast, accelerating fast, jumping, shooting with your left foot, being selfish, having vision or having more vision than the guy with vision OR SUDDENLY UNLOCKING AN EXTRA LAYER OF VISION TO HAVE MORE VISION THAN THE GUY WITH VISION THAT HAS MORE VISION THAN YOU?

167,Any interesting anime originals for Spring?,11s3fco,"I know Spring is gonna be huge for a lot of people, and I'm not trying to say that what you're excited for is wrong, but I'm looking at MAL for Spring and I'm only truly excited for Oshi No Ko for reasons best left unspoiled. Jigokuraku's art looks nice but I no longer get excited for anything remotely close to Shonen until I am at least 4 episodes in. It's also not what I'm really craving.

I guess having Deca-dence, Nomad, and Lycoris Fucking Recoil in consecutive years has left me spoiled and I want to know if there's a promising anime that will have a neatly packed story so that I know I will get a conclusion of some sort at the end of the run. Yes, I know Lycoris will continue but that's only because of its success, it mostly tied up all of its threads.

So I guess the **TL;DR** is: Any promising anime originals coming out soon?",GrimMind,14,3,0.59

I mention the beach as that's the easiest way I have of pointing them out but they show up in stations, roads, wherever the female lead happens to go along without some form of supervision or after a fight with the MC.

182,Is the development of Vincent Law satisfying in Ergo Proxy?,11rv1ke,"I remember watching like the first 15-18 episodes of Ergo Proxy years ago, but I had dropped it because I found the male leader too lame and as far as I remember, pacing in the middle part was very poorly handled and I simply didn't find it engaging enough. The atmosphere was nice though. Do you think it's worth watching to the end just to see the development and if there's a cool ending or some stuff? I'm thinking about Ergo Proxy reawakening and going cool or some stuff.

I have been binging a lot of anime recently and had no problem starting new one just after the previous one and these anime are kinda OK and not too great. But after finishing Darling in the franxx I am lost for words and have no urge to start the new anime.

Yaoi/Yuri Romance anime are usually kinda... vanilla? Maybe that's the wrong way to describe it. I just mean that they don't really rely on unique premises to attract viewers. These anime are just kinda presented as ""Hey, look! Another Yaoi/Yuri Romance! But with a different couple this time! Which, by default, automatically means it's different from other Yaoi/Yuri anime beyond the 'Two people meet and fall in love' premise since different people react to situations differently!""

For my money, I think its pretty safe to say that isekai's on its way out and Dark Battle Shounen will soon replace it as the dominant genre in the medium just based on previous trends. All pretty safe bets, but I'm curious what y'all think and if you've got any guesses on what will become the new dominant genre trend once people grow tired of Shounen (they did it once, they'll do it again).

Lyrics to the ending song, “Clockwork Quick and Lightning Slow \[A Spell to make all things well\]” by Julia Shortreed

See the bunny sings

And puffs of steam

From singing kettles in the trees

Red butterflies

With forks and knives

Who like to make a meal of time

Life is clockwork quick

Lightning slow

Faster on your toes

So...Eat your sugared dream

And face the day before it runs away

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

First comment of the day goes to /u/No_Rex

> Before I get to episode 9, a belated answer to the QoTD about magic yesterday. The answer about what type of magic system the show uses has a straight forward answer (that was already given by several people who responded yesterday): It works with an about as pure as they can get soft magic system.

> The interesting part is how well this fits the plot and theme of the show. Soft magic systems are especially weak when they are used as problem solvers (because the lack of rules leads to deus-ex-machina) or when there is interpersonal conflict (because the winner is decided by the writer’s whim, not something the reader can predict). If you look back at the episodes so far, you’ll see that magic is rarely used for either. In the heavy episodes 3&4, Elaina takes the non-hero approach of not intervening. She deliberately does not solve the obviously problematic injustices via magic. We also see very little fighting via magic (and when we do, the victor is clearly telegraphed).

> Instead a lot of the magic use goes into the advantages of soft magic: A sense of wonder and exploration. Animated-hair-stealing-dolls are a perfect example of a magic use that is almost pure fluff, not a serious problem. This sense of wonder ties in perfectly with the overall theme of the show: Elaina travelling around and soaking in the wonderful (or sometimes not so wonderful) world around her.

> Up until now, my evaluation of the show is higher that its objective criteria would suggest (I think the pacing is messed up, and the characters are a mixed bag) and I think the extremely fitting use of soft magic as a setup is a main reason why the downsides do not weigh too hard for me.

Second comment of the day goes to /u/polaristar

> I won't go into too much nitpicking of the flaws, I feel others have already pointed out the plotholes and how it went over the top on the gore and shock value.

> The tragedy of this story is sadly not the child, because I find it odd how we see the child is just a victim that went mad because she was sexually abused by the Uncle, but then when it turns out it was the Father she is framed as a cartoonishly evil villain.

> I disagree with this approach but I think I can offer a Devil's Advocate reason why that is. The whole point of this mission was so Estelle could feel better about herself even though pragmatically it'd solve nothing even if she succeeded. Elaina was having trouble bringing herself to fight back against this girl, but Estelle did so with a vengeance, slowly and brutally because she was mad that she was wrong, that that girl was never really her friend a long time ago, that this grand narrative she built in her mind was a sham. That she wasted her life on this. This was never about saving Serena this was about appeasing her own guilt and Ego.

> That fact she literally threw away a huge chunk of her life (Her Memories) For this is both sad and pathetic.

> Elaina doesn't even take her payment, it would feel tainted.

> I don't think Elaina is truly as cold and uncaring in her pragmatism as she appears, I think it's particularly a defense mechanism, she choosing not to care, be invested, or get engaged, because once she does she can't easily pull out of it. I think in actuality Elaina cares a lot more then she lets on, and she chooses not to because every time she sleeps and tries to be a Hero she's forced to just watch her inevitable impotence.

> Also I disagree with last weeks and this weeks comments, Magic system in Elaina I think is pretty shit.

> BUT POLARISTAR IT'S A SOFT MAGIC SYSTEM IT'S NOT SUPPOSE TO BE SOME UBER RATIONAL LOGIC PROGRAMMING STUFF OR ALTERNATIVE LAWS OF PHYSICS BUT ADD WONDER AND WHIMSY TO THE WORLD!!!

> Except it doesn't the magic feels very cheap, gimmicky, and doesn't even have an intuitive dream like quality to it, it feels like gaudy special effects with the most shallow rule of cool completely failing to integrate it into the worldbuilding itself.

Last comment of the day goes to /u/thatguywithawatch

> I'm gonna be hard on this episode. Not because I think it was bad (I don't), but because it deserved to be better. The unpredictable, changing tone from week to week is one of the reasons why I liked the show when it first aired, and I think having a traumatic and disturbing episode out of the blue like this would have added to the overall quality of the show immensely if it had stuck the landing. But instead it just felt like a wasted opportunity.

> So most of episode 9 is a setup for the twist reveal that, surprise! the little girl was the murderer the whole time, before shocking the audience with the sort of violence and horror that has only been occasionally hinted at before, like in episode 4. But here's where the first problem comes up: The entire payoff hinges on us believing that a tiny, maybe ~10 year old human girl with a knife was able to overpower and kill/incapacitate three grown adults at once, one of whom was a full grown witch who was presumably channeling Elaina's magic to fight her. Like, wtf was Estella doing? Unless Selena managed to go full Skyrim 100 Sneak on them and take them out unnoticed one at a time with silent backstabs, I don't see how the scene Elaina walked into could possibly have come about.

> I might be being way too critical about that one point, but once any sense of believability was removed from the situation for me, the rest of the scene just became blood and gore for the sake of having blood and gore. Additionally, Selena turned into an apparently nearly-invulnerable super strong devil for no explainable reason other than letting her death get dragged out for maximum squeamishness.

> It's a shame, because the first half of the episode had a lot of really good moments and setup. Elaina's cheerful bitchiness after she took mild offense at Estella's comment about her age was hilarious. Or the way Selena's dad casually made that weird comment about Estella's nape, foreshadowing the fact that he's a sexual abuser (admittedly a little heavy handed, but still). Also, I thought the time travel concept was handled in a decent way, both by showing that it's impractically difficult to travel back even for short periods of time, and also clarifying that they wouldn't even be changing anything in their current present, simply creating a new timeline for Estella's peace of mind.

> I have not yet read the books, so maybe they were just following the source material 100% faithfully. But, I think it wouldn't have taken much tweaking to turn this episode into something genuinely compelling and disturbing rather than just shocking and unexpected. First, hint at some believable way that Selena could have overpowered two adults and a witch all by herself; Hell, maybe all it would take would be to show that Selena could secretly use magic. Then, tone down Selena's gleeful insane psycopath act; she's an abused, angry, twisted kid in a horrific and awful situation who finally snapped. That's plenty disturbing and upsetting on its own without cheapening the entire scene by having her act like a maniacal serial killer from a popcorn horror flick. Finally, Estella killing Selena should have been quick, brutally unexpected, and tragic. Having it be so drawn out and over the top felt both unrealistic (again, Selena's supposedly just a regular human girl), and excessive for the wrong reasons.

> Maybe I'm being way too nitpicky, and I'm curious to see what the general consensus is in the comments today, but I'm just bummed out because they were clearly trying to make something unexpectedly disturbing, troubling, and completely different from every episode that came before, which is an endeavor that should be applauded if done well, and they were really close to doing it well, but then it derailed in the climax when it heavily prioritized violent shock value and silly horror-anime type schlock over any sort of believable writing. If the only goal of the episode was to make me wince at what was being visibly shown on screen, then it succeeded, but that's not an achievement in and of itself if it's not backed by compelling writing and realistic character actions.

> Elaina being stripped of her typical indifferent, unfazed attitude and sobbing in horror before the end credits deserved to be a much more impactful moment, and it would have been if it came at the end of a better episode.

So there's the question: Is the dub good or should I just stick with the original?",Parma_WdS,16,0,0.21

209,What anime are more popular outside of Japan?,11r50e1,"The entire world has anime communities, all nations seem to have some anime they prefer or like, and sometimes it may be ones that Japan hates or doesn't care about.

A good classical example is Voltron, or Golion, Japan at best has it as a trivia question since the mecha's designer was also the mecha designer for Super Sentai from the start to the 00's.

Otherwise, Golion just...somehow didn't get canceled and was considered a bad forgettable mecha show that had boring characters and a weekly show with little plot where the mecha had a clear finishing move that took long to use it, not that similar shows didn't exist, but unlike something like Zambot 3 or Voltes V which had far more plot episodes, more memorable characters, actual storylines that went a bit harder and darker than expected and thus still get referenced and are beloved to this day, Golion just...exists.

Japanese reception is incredibly tepid and it's really just known as that anime America for some reason cares about and sharing a designer with Super Sentai.

To a point where the studio that brought Voltron to the world actually wanted a different show with another lion themed mecha called Daltanious, but the same studio also had made Golion, and thus when asked to give them episodes of the robot show with a lion, they mistook it for Golion and they decided to dub it anyways even though originally they wanted Daltanious for having been a better show and much more popular at the time than Golion.

Golion was so popular in Japan the only reason it got dubbed into Voltron was because of a mistake, and then Voltron got really big and it even had it's reboot on Netflix while the original series is...again, mostly remembered for trivia questions.",Square_Abalone_4484,38,0,0.39

New movies were pretty good but more so a retell of the original story. 

What IF they make a completely different series from prequel perspective before the 2nd impact. Or A new alternate timeline where Shinji wasn't abandoned child, Rei isn't a clone, Asuka is still a transfer student. Going down a more Hero team build up that's more upbeat.. rather than  melancholy??

212,Which anime to watch next with my girlfriend?,11r2mfz,"Hi,   


Today, I need your help to know what is the next anime that my girlfriend and I will watch. I introduced her to anime 4 years ago, and I have to say that she loved it. The problem is that we are running out of anime that I had already seen and that I wanted to show her. Now, we will have to start anime that we have not seen, neither her, nor me. In a way, we are going out of our comfort zone, and this can lead to some disillusionment if we don't like some anime. I will only mention here the anime and not the movies.   


What did we see? Death Note, Hunter x Hunter, Code Geass, Food Wars, Erased, Kuroko no Basket, Major, Major 2nd, Ace of Diamond, Run with the wind, SnK, One Piece, Tokyo Revengers, Detective Conan.   


Her ranking:   


1) Detective Conan (Of course, when you see more than 1000 episodes during one year, you have a particular attachment to the characters. It is especially that which works here, we are attached to the characters, and we want to follow them in their adventures).   


2) Major / Major 2nd (A real masterpiece, legitimate. You follow the evolution of Goro from his childhood to his adulthood. This is the most complete anime we've seen: Character evolution, romance, school life, slice of life, sports, thrills, emotion. It's typically the anime where you don't know anything about baseball, and you just want to go and play this sport).  


3) One Piece (This is what surprises me the most. I think it's correlated to the length of the anime which makes that when you pass a certain threshold, you necessarily get more attached to the characters. During the fights, she kept telling me that it was too long, and that she was bored and yet, she really holds on to the characters, their construction, and that takes precedence over everything else. Even if One Piece has a lot of flaws: its length, its fights, the slapstick side of some characters).  


4) Haikyuu (If we assume that Major is not really a sport anime, Haikyuu is his favorite sport anime. Not easy to decide between those who come, but it gives him a slight advantage for the thrills, the characters and their evolution).  


5) Food Wars (This is one of the first anime she saw. We love food, so we put this on randomly, and we were very surprised, we didn't expect it. Once the eicchi side put aside, we loved it, because there is romance, school life and especially very interesting characters).  


6) Ace of Diamond (Not easy to decide between Haikyuu/Ace of Diamond and Kuroko, here, the ingredients are the same: good characters, developments, the side a little slice of life).  


7) Kuroko no Basket (First sports anime she saw. I think that the fact that the characters are already very strong and played in its disadvantage compared to Haikyuu and Ace of Diamond).  


8) SnK (Her opinion is very divided. She devoured the first two seasons, then, when there was the explanation of the titans, the complexity of the thing, and the fact that she was a little disappointed with the explanation, make her like less the second part of the work, even if it remains very very solid).   


9) Run with the wind (Short anime but it has everything we are looking for with a very nice soundtrack. It's shorter so we are less attached, but a very nice work).   


10) Tokyo Revengers (This is the last anime we saw. The beginning doesn't look good, but then it's excellent).   


She liked but it's just nice not excellent or huge for her: Code Geass, Death Note, Erased, HxH.  


She didn't want to continue: Gambling School (Too weird as an anime), My Hero Academia (She had trouble with the very cartoonish graphic style) and GTO.   


The anime that I saw and that I would like her to see: Parasite, Naruto, Kaiji, Prince of Tennis, Baby Steps. I also saw Ippo & Hikaru no Go, but surprisingly, I don't have a good memory of Ippo. It was nice, but not amazing. There was a lot of slowness and length in the work I thought.   


What she likes: Endearing characters where you really see their development, romance, school life, slice of life. As you can see, there are several genres in this ranking, however, they all have a common point with characters that you can get attached to.  


What she doesn't like: Quirky, slapstick characters, she likes what is ""normal"" not ""outrageous"". She has trouble with anime where there are a lot of fights (it's often too long for her). She prefers to focus on the development of the characters, the links between them. She prefers when the anime is finished because she is tired of waiting 100 years to get the sequel. 

What do you recommend us for the continuation? If possible, a finished anime (to avoid the current frustration we have with Tokyo Revengers). Take all your recommendations, and it's even better if it's on ADN or Crunchyroll.   


We just started ""Horimiya"", it's not the anime of the century, far from it. And yet, it is appreciable, it changes, it is lighter in its story, and we can get attached to the characters and laugh at the different situations. This is my first anime purely in this genre.   


Here is the small list I had in mind, unfortunately, I think that there are either anime that are bad, others that do not have to stick with our tastes and others that are not finished. I put it anyway as an indication:  


\- Yowamushi Pedal (Controversial anime, some like it, some don't, that's rare for a sports anime).  
\- Eyeshield 21.  
\- Kaguya-Sama (I'm afraid of an anime that repeats itself from episode to episode and that we go in circles).  
\- Orange.  
\- Ahiru no sora.  
\- Hanebado (Apparently, it's quite a weird anime).  
\- Blue Lock.  
\- Love all play.  
\- Ao Ashi.  
\- Your lie in april.  
\- Steins gate (Now I'm the one who is afraid, having to wait 12 episodes to get into the story, it's not obvious).  
\- 3-gatsu no lion.  
\- Welcome to the ballroom.  
\- Classroom of the elite.  


I'm interested in all your feedbacks. Thanks a lot!",_Rama_,175,0,0.39

**Fae Facts:** The adder stone, which we see Chise using as a true-seeing tool here is an actual concept used by celtic druids, although their powers and origins vary from story to story.

**Discussion Topics:**

How do you feel about Chise and Elias's relationship now, compared to at the start of the series?

Plush wooly bug vs plush axlotl lizard friend?!

**Manga/BTS:**

\[Chapter 19-20\] Nothing new in manga land, but for all of those feeling let down by this season's OP I do recommend reading the lyrics, which I think add some interest.

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

First comment of the day goes to /u/Specs64z 

> d!Elaina's scream at being flung from the bed has an almost primal quality to its intonation that I think fits the scene much better than s!Elaina’s. Though their words are basically the same, d!Elaian is much more wrathful than s!Elaina in her delivery. I find myself once again leaning toward the dub’s direction on this one. I just don’t get the same murderous intent from s!Elaina, nor the same level of smug self-satisfaction after her victory. In this episode, the sub finally catches up to the dub in the audio department with the voice echoes. It’s still handled better in the dub, but at least it’s there in sub this time.

> The dub does have a pretty notable misstep this episode, though. For those not in the know, there’s a saying in Japan that “a woman’s hair is her life” or something thereabout. There isn’t really any such belief in the USA, so the line about Elaina losing her hair being like losing her life as well as the dialogue implying the Ripper is a serial killer rather than a serial haircutter don’t work, à mon avis.

> I can’t say I like the stranger danger way she’s looking at me

> I swear, this dub is such a W, what a priceless line.

> This episode is something of a return to form after last and handles its sillier story elements with a lot more tact. I find myself liking it considerably more on rewatch than my first time through.

> The doll maker is a fascinating figure to consider. Ultimately, most of us engage in stories to feel something, so what separates us from this disturbing voyeur? Are we really any different, watching along to see what new feelings and thoughts take form by the events on screen? The answer is obviously yes, we are different in this case since we play no part in the events themselves, but it’s still some food for thought. We aren’t always going to be an observer, so it’s imperative to know when to ground yourself.

Second comment of the day goes to /u/Esovan13

> This is another episode that exemplifies why I like this series so much. Weird places with weird people with weird customs. This time it's a city that loves dolls. They're known far and wide for them. But within the depths of such a city lies a darkness that consumes all who encounter it.

> While the dolls on the surface are normal high quality dolls, there exists a black market for dolls with more...special characteristics. Whether it's the doll's size, it's profession, or the materials it's made of, anything that doesn't fit the clean image must go through those channels. This lead to the perfect environment for the Cutter, a degenerate who likes stealing hair and using it to create dolls. The purpose of which is to enjoy the despair of the victims and the happiness of those who receive her goods.

> Elaina, however, was the wrong target. Due to happenstance, she became a target with the Cutter not knowing she was a witch. This lead to a confrontation where the Cutter severely underestimated her opponent, leading to her quick capture. And who else to assist except for Saya's very own teacher! I'm surprised it took her so long to realize who Elaina was with how much Saya would have talked about her during her apprenticeship.

> The Cutter captured, she is brought to the Witch Association, where Saya learns of the Cutter's crimes. By the time she's done with her, the Association may not even need to administer a punishment.

> Another light hearted episode, focusing on the wackiness that a magical world like this can bring. It also brings us two sights for sore eyes, in the form of short hair Elaina and masquerade Elaina. Her hair is great, but her confidence in her appearance is not unfounded as she's still more than capable of serving looks with her hair cut short. To be honest, pink dresses aren't my favorite so personally I have to dock some points for that. Don't tell her though.

> Unlike yesterday, this episode doesn't really have much of a moral or lesson to take away. Well, I guess it has the message of ""respect women's bodily autonomy"" and ""don't be a fucking creep,"" but I like to imagine that those lessons are preaching to the choir for the most part.

> u/hiimneato, I was rereading the novels, and I thought you'd enjoy this exchange from volume four:

> “…Really? Isn’t magic a bit too convenient?”

> “It’s magic. Isn’t convenience the whole point?”

> Soft magic system go BRRRRRRRRRRRR

222,[WT] Sexy Commando Side Story: Amazing! Masaru - A Cult-Classic 90s Gag Anime,11qmknu,"##[WARNING!! If you are unusu­ally sens­ible, ser­i­ous, or a wan­na­bee goody goody then there’s no need to read this Reddit post. Also, no criticisms allowed! — The writer's father](https://imgur.com/XwfDll0)


You want to watch that anime everyone talks about where the main character wants to make 100 friends at school. Wait, what's a Komi? Some kind of Meso? I was talking about *Sexy Commando Side Story: Amazing! Masaru*, a gag anime that has achieved a cult-classic status in Japan but woefully needs more awareness across the globe

You too want to know the ultimate secrets of the Sexy Commando martial arts, right? You want to watch a short-form anime from the late 90s with only eight minutes of non-stop laughs an episode, right? You want impromptu Ukulele lessons in the middle of your anime until the creators get bored of animating them, right? Well if you don't, that's the whole point of Watch This posts so I'm going to change your mind! **CLEANUP PRINCESS!!!**

##[This post has been recorded in stereo hi-fi. Please enjoy the post at a high volume. Thank you.](https://imgur.com/RwylZtH)

###Why Watch Sexy Commando Side Story: Amazing! Masaru?

Because you want to laugh.

...

Oh crap, this has to be 1500 characters or more doesn't it? Okay... **ROGER!**

###What Even Is Sexy Commando?

Debates have raged on about if Superman could beat Goku (with Sailor Moon thrown in the mix) but when Hananakajima performs the Mel­an­choly of Elise by unzipping his pants, it is obvious he could demolish them all with the Sexy Commando. The concept of Sexy Commando is that you don't need raw power to win a fight, if the opponent is sufficiently distracted, your blows will hit them that much harder as they are caught off guard.

It's as if Sexy Commando itself is infused into the very ink that makes this anime because you'll rarely know where the jokes and gags are actually going to go and will end up busting a gut when your expectations are subverted at every turn. There are aliens, mustaches can kill people, an old man (kinda) named Susan can move an entire school with his bare hands to inspire a future prime minister. Seriously, even if you expect the unexpected with this show, you'll end up knocked out by a Fatal Comedy Dunk Shoot!

###That's the Igap Pitching Machine! What's going on?! I heard that it was out of production!

But hey, why just listen to me when I say the show is funny? The book it is based on (and when I say based on, it's almost word-for-word a copy of the first 48 chapters of the manga, the perfect adaptation) [has sold over 7 million copies](https://www.sony.jp/active-speaker/special/lounge/interview/usuta/) in Japan. It was even [ranked 9th](https://ranking.goo.ne.jp/column/4582/ranking/50583/) on a list of the top 50 gag anime of all time in 2017. Seriously, this thing came out in 1998 and still has people saying how hilarious it is to this day and you should be a Sexymate by becoming one of them! 

From the moment you hear what you may now consider [the best and catchiest anime OP of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nRK3NxgzFs&ab_channel=Nijijiii) in 'Romance' by Penicillin (which should be blasted at full volume all jokes aside) you're going to be excited and ready to have a good time. **WATCHU!!!**

##[It's getting late. Please lower the volume so as not to disturb your neighbors. Thank you.](https://imgur.com/OeLfAGq)

Alright, there might be one tiny problem about this anime: It's VERY Japanese. Chunks of *Sexy Commando Side Story: Amazing! Masaru's* humor is going to involve wordplay, puns, and things that may be harder to get for those who don't fluently speak the language. Did I mention the humor is VERY Japanese? The kind of things that you might see on game shows there that sometimes confuse foreign audiences? Of course, tons of people do love that stuff regardless, so you'll be in good company here if that's the case.

Also, I'd argue the wacky animations make up for any potential confusion in spades. Remember some of the weirder bits of animation you saw in the beloved *Bocchi the Rock*? I can't say this show goes quite that hard, but it is not afraid to just make the characters look and move in the wackiest ways possible.

Still, I won't deny that this show probably isn't for everyone and that some folks will be put off by the jokes or just plain won't understand them. It's okay, someday your minds will be awakened to the true power of Sexy Commando. Until then, [the Watch This archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/watchthisarchive) has other hilarious shows that may fit your tastes now. **ROGER!!!**

##Hella Awesome Coffee Shop J'Taime (TLDR)

There's a reason that *Sexy Commando Side Story: Amazing! Masaru* is a cult-classic gag anime in Japan. It might honestly be Akitaru Daichi's magnum opus. I've been trying to infuse this post with some of the flavor of the show, but there's no way I could capture all of its hilarious glory. Each episode is just eight minutes long, watch the first few and you'll get the vibe right away. If it feels good, watch a few more and just keep laughing harder as the absurdity continues to build each episode. **Give the show shot, you won't regret it!

232,I watched Steins Gate in chronological order for the first time,11qcnnd,"Steins Gate gave me one of the most thrilling experiences that I've ever had with anime, I watched the first 22 episodes on the way. Then, I got into certain forums. Some people were recommending me to watch this show in Chronological order which basically involves watching the first 22 episodes, then we need to watch an episode that leads to Steins Gate 0 and then I finished it and then watching episodes 23 and 24. 

I was pretty underwhelmed with the finale of Steins Gate, I'm saying it's bad, I don't think it reaches the peak that Steins Gate 0 has achieved. Steins Gate 0 has more issues than Steins Gate, that is something I noticed. Episode 21 of Steins Gate 0 is easily the best thing that the Steins; gate franchise achieved so far. In terms of hype, that episode is on par with AoT's best episodes, that's just how good the episode actually is to me. 

In terms of hype, I just feel like the finale of Steins Gate wasn't as good as episode 21 of Steins Gate 0. 

In my opinion, 

Peaks of Steins Gate 0 >>>>>>>>>> Peaks of Steins Gate

234,Suzume no Tojimari. A decent anime that you would enjoy... more so if you’re a person from Japan.,11qc6pg,"[Suzume no Tojimari](https://myanimelist.net/anime/50594/Suzume_no_Tojimari) is the most recent movie released by Makoto Shinkai, which have made 14 billion yen so far at the Japanese box office. I have gone to watch the film twice now since its release in Asia, once in IMAX and the other in 4D. Let me tell you, it is a great movie….if you’re from Japan.

That notion aside, I do find Suzume to be a good anime film. It has a better story than Weathering With You(2019), but falls short of Your Name(2016).  Was it a fun watch?  Absolutely.

Before I continue, spoilers up ahead. Please watch it before you read my opinions below, OR if you have resigned yourself to not watching the film anyway.

I was so excited when I learned of Suzume from this subreddit about a year ago. Disappointed as usual that Japan decides to lock the movie locally for 4-5 months before the world. But nonetheless I am grateful that I still get to enjoy this movie in the cinema. You can really feel that Shinkai and his team made this anime for the big screen.  With multiple usages of panning shots, wide shots, and panoramic shots, I can assure you that a TV/monitor or even worse… a smartphone screen would not do the film justice. With the beautiful signature art style of the creator, it only makes sense to enjoy it in the theatre.

Here are the brief bullet point pros and cons of the film.  I’ll go into the details after the list.

Pros:

* Animation style.
* Music. Radwimps’ return with collaboration.  OSTs good availability.
* Story build ups.

Cons:

* Lots of usages of distracting 3D CG.
* Imbalance in character exposition/dive.
* Misplaced unnecessary romance story line.
* Weird characterizations peppered throughout the story.
* The slow moments are too long making story beats feeling disjointed. Pacing issue.

# ANIMATION

The classic animation style by Shinkai is back. It’s quite clear that the studio holds back a lot compared to the previous films. Maybe it’s because of COVID, financial, or talent reasons, it’s not as well polished as the previous movies. But either way, when it hits, it hits hard. And the beautiful seaside towns to the “ruins” of abandoned city/areas looks very pretty.

The problem with the animation that certainly can take you out of the experience, would be the usage of 3D CG. It is used for the background characters, buildings, and vehicles. And I tell you, when CG is used it looks really bad, because the 2D art in comparison is so much richer and impactful. Every now and again when watching, I kept on being pulled out from the film whenever I see CG art scattered throughout the film. I wish there is more consistency in the art, but alas it’s just not there as a whole.

Apart from that, the colour palette has changed a bit. It now leans on a slightly less vibrant tone relative to the previous films.  Next, The flashy landscape animation is made far less comparatively speaking.

# MUSIC

Music wise this film did it right. The film scoring is on point, by allowing the scenes to breathe properly and move without purposefully manipulating the audience to feel a certain emotion. It is there merely as a guide .

Glad to see Radwimps’ continuous collaboration with Makoto Shinkai. The theme song, [Suzume, featuring toaka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LW9DpmhrPE) is absolutely amazing and really sets the mystery fantasy tone to the story.

Furthermore, I really do appreciate that all of the film scoring and OSTs are made available for free in Spotify and YouTube (*at least where I’m at*). This is so cool as it removes the hassle of having to find a more “high seas” approach to obtain the music. I remember hunting for anime OSTs in the 90s all the way to the mid-2010s. Believe me it is not a fun adventure.  So thank you to the studio for making the music available.

# STORY

Much like Makoto Shinkai's previous works, the coming of age theme is ever present in this movie. [Suzume](https://myanimelist.net/character/204258/Suzume_Iwato) is a 17-year-old girl from rural Kyushu. She embarks on a big adventure after accidentally releasing a keystone god ([Daijin](https://myanimelist.net/character/218782/Daijin)) that was guarding a mystical door that prevents/quells big earthquakes from happening. Because of this mistake, she has to help a mystical door **CLOSER** named [Souta](https://myanimelist.net/character/218020/Souta_Munakata)(*unknown age but probably early to mid-20s),* who unfortunately was transformed by Daijin into a 3 legged children’s stool(chair). A very interesting premise in my opinion. The very fact that earthquakes are caused by a divine creatures that looks like a giant worm coming out of a door seem like a very imaginative and exciting concept to me.  Souta being transformed into a stool is also gold, as it provides Suzume with a proper reason to be by his side, and it provides a ton of comedic moments throughout the show. The stool can talk and move.  Now imagine how people would react to seeing that?  It invokes this child like feeling of wonder.

The build up to me is one of the highlights of the movie. Suzume was never able to move on and process what happened to her mother as it happened when she was very young. So, by going through these adventures and meeting new people and experiencing challenges and hardships throughout the way, you slowly see her develop as a person coming into terms with her past. And when she finally decides to take a trip back to her old hometown to face what happened in the past, it makes the moment extra special.The build up between Suzume and her Aunt [Tamaki](https://myanimelist.net/character/218152/Tamaki_Iwato) is also sweet. Initially, their relationship seems like a regular lovable mother-daughter relationship. But slowly you start the see the cracks. Tamaki being extremely  possessive and restrictive to Suzume, and Suzume seemingly distancing herself from her throughout her adventures. I specifically remember a scene in early parts of the film, where Tamaki held Suzume’s arm so tight that Suzume had to twist her arms to get away from Tamaki so she could pursue Souta and Daijin. The animators did a great work showing that the Aunt was holding Suzume too tight. Later on like a nightmare ex, she sends Suzume walls of emotional text messages which furthermore pushes a teenager feeling smothered. The build up of tension between the two finally climaxes when Sandaijin forces Tamaki and Suzume to speak their minds out about each other. Tamaki finally confesses that she does feel that adopting Suzume has negatively impacted her life as a woman, and I totally get that as it is a real thing to happen when someone had to adopt a child when they aren’t ready for.  Suzume also finally tells her aunt, that she feels smothered or drowned by her strong presence. My favourite part of their story though is when they made up. Tamaki apologizes to Suzume **BUT** doesn’t take back what she said. She honestly admitted that she does have negative feelings for Suzume, however it is only a small part and she does have other feelings for her, such as love. Suzume understands that this is a complex situation for the both of them, and they forgive each other.  What a heart-warming and very real scene.

Then we have the slightly disturbing romantic relationship between Suzume and Souta. Firstly, I can’t fathom an adult male in their early-mid 20s falling in love with a childish girl such as Suzume. Secondly, I don’t understand why Suzume can fall in love with Souta, when her only initial impression of him is that he is good looking.In the beginning of the film when Souta and Suzume met, Suzume claims that she remembers him from a long time back.  But there was no indication to this be it a flash back or even in dream sequence prior. The reasoning right there doesn’t even make sense narrative wise. The only time we get to see a younger version of her meeting an adult version of Souta is at the end ^((\~2 hours in)), which is just absolutely rubbish IMO.Then we must deal with Suzume’s very questionable characterization. She is a stalker, chasing a stranger to an abandoned ruin just to see him again. Forcing herself into Souta’s life without taking his opinions into considerations.  She is also so open to throwing her life away (almost suicidal) without the proper set-up to this type of behaviour. I just can’t believe that this immature teenager somehow ends up with an adult.  Souta who’s mysteriously aged for some reason (but you can estimate), has so little reason to fall in love with her. Heck, he has a better possible romantic plot with [Serizawa](https://myanimelist.net/character/219381/Tomoya_Serizawa)^((University friend)) narratively speaking. The love with Suzume is sudden. All this while we see a partnership and budding friendship and not romance. Suddenly by the end of it, he romantically loves her?I also wished that we know more about Souta’s back story. This movie is so asymmetrical as Suzume is basically at the forefront, yet Souta who plays an equally big role to Suzume’s character development have so little background build up that he feels like a plot device rather than a character. For most parts of the movie, he is this cool level headed adult who’s a pro at *closing mystical doors*, then suddenly nearing the climax having an existential crisis without any setup.

Also, there is a lot of slow moments in the movie that just ends up dragging it down. I’m a big fan of slow moments, but when the story beats doesn’t hit because we try to make every moment emotional or atmospheric it makes the pacing feel really bad. Your Name has really good story beats with 1 hit every 5 – 10 minutes. But Suzume on the other hand can be every 15-30 minutes. It’s tiring to watch a story like this, especially one that emphasizes a more emotional narrative.

Now, the elephant in the room. Why did I say that a person from Japan would enjoy this better?If you’re from Japan, you would love this movie more as it heavily features the theme of natural disasters particularly earthquakes and tsunamis. Suzume as a child lost her mother during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami incident, which has greatly impacted her character and story progression. The main plot of the story is Suzume and Souta going around areas in Japan closing “mystical doors” with a magical key to prevent big eruptions of earthquakes, or at least quell them.You can see now that this element of the movie is heavily pandering towards Japanese audience who are born and raised in Japan.  I ^((and my culture)) don’t quite feel the dread and sadness associated with earthquakes and tsunami.  I’m certain that the Japanese audience would resonate well with the story, but unfortunately for me its a big loss as I don’t care much about the crisis, and the story of the movie does a bad job at making me feel so.  Of course, if you live in parts of the world with high mortality rate towards earthquakes, or have experienced a gruesome one yourself, you might jive with the story better.

**By the way**, did anyone notice that this anime has really bad spatial and time narrative executions? The worms and closing of the doors are very time sensitive isn’t it? Suzume can be 5 kilometres or more away from a worm, yet she magically teleports to the places in like 5 seconds by running. She often spots a giant worm far away in the mountains, but somehow she can **run** or bike all the way there just in time to close the door. WTF man?  How strong is this girls’ cardio? Who in the production saw this and said, “well, good enough.”?

Anyways, I’m interested to hear what you think?What did **you** enjoy and not so enjoy in the film?Do you agree or disagree with anything that I wrote above?I’m interested to read from all of you.",GinoWithaQuestion,39,19,0.71

A couple things, HxH is my favorite anime and Re:Zero is my second favorite. I only rated shows I finished, dropped shows didn't get rated. I'm 99% sure that all the anime I've watched or attempted to watch is on my page. Some of my ratings are fairly old and I won't be able to update them until I get a rewatch in but I feel like it represents what anime I enjoy well enough. I have no genre limits but I don't want to watch the most awful kinds of anime like eromanga sensi, boku no pico or redo of healer, nothing like those pls.

I do have a lot of shows in my 'plan to watch' section so if any of those in particular stand out as a must-watch I wouldn't mind the heads-up.

Much appreciated

239,Here are my in depth reviews for “Carole and Tuesday” & “Hyouka”. As well as a ranking of every anime that I’ve seen so far. The final part of my anime review series.,11qa421,"# Introduction:

Hello there. This is Part Three in a massive project where I rank & review all 10 anime that I’ve watched since I talked about my first 10 anime back in 2022. Part One contains a more in depth preamble, as well as my thoughts on Usagi Drop, A Place Further Than The Universe, Komi Can’t Communicate, & Star Wars: Visions. Part Two contains my thoughts on A Lull In The Sea, Ranking Of Kings, Dr. Stone, & Spy X Family. Here are the links to those posts. I'd still love to talk about those shows with anyone here.

Part One: [https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11o6qog/back\_in\_january\_2022\_i\_made\_a\_massive\_post\_where/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11o6qog/back_in_january_2022_i_made_a_massive_post_where/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Part Two: [https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11p6krb/heres\_part\_23\_in\_my\_11th\_20th\_anime\_review\_series/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11p6krb/heres_part_23_in_my_11th_20th_anime_review_series/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I would especially be appreciative if you went & checked out Part Two because that post was almost completely DOA for whatever reason & there’s still so much more that I wanna talk about with those 4 shows. I don't want my hours of writing to be for nothing.

I will first be going over my thoughts on each of these shows individually, in the order that I watched them. Then at the end of the post, I will provide some final thoughts & rank every single one of them. And please remember the following: The **biggest reason** why I’m making this post at all is so that I can talk about all of these shows with as many of you as possible. So ***please,*** if you want to share your thoughts on any of these shows, and/or give me your opinions on MY opinions, I implore you to do so in the comments below. I’m all ears. And for the record, I don’t expect anyone to read every single one of these reviews. Just look around for the shows you care about.

If there are any anime you’d wanna recommend to me based off my thoughts on these 10 shows, please do so in the comments below. Now, let us finish this.

# Carole & Tuesday:

For anyone not familiar with this show, Carole & Tuesday is a slice-of-life-ish music anime that just so happens to also take place in the same universe as the legendary “Cowboy Bebop”. And call me crazy, but I actually decided to watch this BEFORE ever getting to Cowboy Bebop. Even though things do start out as very slice-of-life-y in this series, there are some much larger & more ambitious plot points that do eventually become a part of the narrative… and to pretty mixed results I would say. Let’s get into it.

The best part of this show is without question it’s two titular characters. Both Carole & Tuesday are such immediately likeable & compelling protagonists. The show is definitely at it’s best whenever these two are on screen together. The dynamic that’s built up between them over the course of the show feels so believably human & perfectly adorable. I honestly really wish that their relationship had gone even further because I was **hardcore** shipping them throughout most of the show’s runtime. But that’s not something I can hold against the show.

My only issue with them as characters would be that their arcs are kinda vague. Other than them both becoming more confident in their performances & generally becoming closer, I really couldn’t tell you what their individual arcs were. They both go through certain experiences with other characters that change their worldviews in one way or another, but I still can’t help but feel like there should have been a deeper thematic throughline for their characters. I may have just been missing something though. That is 100% possible.

One of those aforementioned “experiences” was Carole finally meeting her long lost father. Even though that subplot was super brief, it was still extremely well handled & very emotionally compelling. I really wish we had gotten a scene after the fact where she talks it over with Tuesday though. That interaction would have been very interesting to watch; seeing as Tuesday is always unloading to Carole about her complicated family drama.

Speaking of which, I feel rather mixed on this show’s whole political angle. It’s an overall good message that I very much agree with, it’s just that it all feels kind of underdeveloped & very awkwardly spliced into the anime’s main musically driven plotline. They do eventually tie it all together in a way that makes for a spectacular ending, but the political stuff spends SO MUCH TIME feeling almost completely irrelevant to the main story that it was often incredibly jarring to cut back to after the girls would give a stirring street performance or something like that. Ms. Simmons' change of heart at the end was very poorly set up as well. I know the show makes it clear that a big part of her shift was the fact that she’s finally rejecting the manipulations of her creepy political advisor, but the fact remains that her sympathetic side was never established well enough to make her sudden turn feel earned or impactful.

This show also has **WAY** too many subplots. Potentially interesting characters like Cybelle & Flora are ***completely*** dropped after compelling introductions, but then they’ll dedicate a ludicrous amount of screen time to the Schwartz & Tao subplot which never even made any sense. I seriously had no idea what was going on there, and it never felt even remotely relevant to anything else. Also, that whole reveal where Tao & Angela turn out to be siblings felt **HILARIOUSLY** pointless. It adds absolutely nothing to the show other than unresolved questions. It would have been better if Tao had just stayed as a brooding side character with no huge stake in the arcs of other characters. That scene where he literally murders “The Black Knight” backstage before casually giving Angela a thumbs up was by far one of the funniest moments in the show. I needed more of THAT from his character.

But finally getting back to some actual positives, I really did enjoy Angela’s overall character. For quite a while there, she kinda just seemed like a typical, spoiled rich-bitch who didn’t care about anything outside of gaining popularity, but the eventual reveal that all she ever really wanted was to create “pure music” like Carole & Tuesday, and that she’s always secretly hated this corporate empire built on her image by her mother *COMPLETELY* recontextualizes her into a far more compelling figure. Her brief downward spiral into a stereotypical celebrity breakdown was more than a little rushed, but it’s still incredibly harrowing to witness. Her reconciliation with Carole & Tuesday in the final episode was really touching, and seeing her finally start to break free from her “iconic” image was really satisfying. A great character overall.

Roddy & Gus both made for excellent supporting characters all throughout. Neither of them were particularly deep or complex, but they were still consistently entertaining & endearingly reliable backbones for the whole Carole & Tuesday movement. I also really like the dynamic between Roddy & the character of Ertegun. Ertegun definitely being another one of my favourites characters here. He’s entertaining as a totally self absorbed asshole in the beginning, entertaining as he actually starts to genuinely respect C&T, and especially entertaining when his career suddenly falls apart & he’s forced to reflect on his self worth. His comeback after overcoming bankruptcy made me so incredibly happy.

Desmond was a very interesting character, “Rick Rubin in a Cowboy Hat” was always super entertaining, and Kyle was pretty much the only thing that ever made the political side of the story interesting. That scene where him & Tuesday witness a terrorist attack was genuinely unnerving, and while her being heartbroken over the fact that he already has a girlfriend was definitely a tad melodramatic, it still led to a really nice moment between her & Carole afterwards. There’s lots of great characters here.

That whole “Mars Brightest” arc was easily the most fun part of the entire anime for me. I especially loved those 90 year old metal singers, that operatic hip-hop artist who wanted to seem thug but was actually completely tame, and of course, the absolutely hysterical Mermaid Sisters. I’d heard clips of that “fucking bullshit” song before, but I had NO IDEA it was from this show. The sheer amount of whiplash that it’s inclusion thrust upon me was wildly entertaining, but now we come to the section of the review where I talk about the music for two long, because this series has an amazing soundtrack

Other than “Hold Me Now” which suffers from an incredibly lame instrumental, ***every single song*** in this show that is actually under the name “Carole & Tuesday” is excellent. “Kiss Me” is one of the boppiest OPs I’ve ever heard, “Someday I’ll Find My Way Home” & “Message in the Wind” are both wonderfully lush & chill ballads, and “The Loneliest Girl” & “Threads” are both super emotionally resonant for me. The crazy part is that I haven’t even mentioned \*half\* of their songs here! They really nailed the music for these two anime girls.

I was a little mixed on all of the show’s other music however. Both Pyotr songs are pretty generic & lifeless, Cybelle’s song was extremely forgettable, and much of Angella’s material is melodramatically motivational to the point where it’s impossible to take seriously. The Ertegun songs weren’t particularly compelling either despite me loving the character so much.

As for some of the other GREAT songs in this anime, it truly is a crime that Crystal & Flora weren’t given more opportunities to sing. “Unbreakable” & “Give You The World” are 2 of the very best tracks in the whole show. The latter of which contains the anime’s best vocal performance, BY FAR. Both GGK songs had a wonderfully bizarre ethereality to them, the wildly ambitious genre blending on “Bulldog Anthem” was kind of incredible, and I still really enjoyed SOME of Angella’s songs. “Not Afraid” makes for an excellent ED, and “All I Want” legitimately kinda reminded me of this one synth-pop band named “Magdalena Bay”. Which is a **VERY GOOD THING** (for those not familiar with the group).

And then you obviously have the 7 minute miracle of “Mother” which concludes the entire show. This track is just so damn triumphant, fun, powerful, emotional, & remarkably epic in scope. An immensely impressive feat of music that stands as probably the single best song in the whole anime. At the very least, it's the piece that’s stuck with me the most after finishing it. Even though I’m very mixed on many of this show’s other aspects, the sheer quantity of excellent music here ensures that I will always remember it fondly. I always have a deep appreciation for stories with a strong musical component,

And even outside of the music, I do still think it’s a pretty good show overall. It’s tangled web of subplots are an absolute mess, certain characters aren’t given nearly enough screen time, and the animation can be kind of inconsistent from time to time. But it still has an excellent duo of protagonists, a plethora of side characters that ARE very well realized, and one of my new favourite soundtracks in all of animation. *Let’s talk some KyoAni now!*

# Hyouka:

Wow… I absolutely loved this show. Wholeheartedly loved it. Which I guess isn’t particularly surprising given the fact that KyoAni still has yet to do anything other than blow me away, but Hyouka still FAR exceeded the expectations I had going in. There is just **so much** to unpack with this series. It is *easily* one of the most richly written, narratively cohesive, thematically complex, & expertly told *stories* that I have ever experienced. There are so many amazing things to talk about here.

For starters, let's go over the show’s absolutely excellent core cast. All 4 of them are extremely interesting & consistently entertaining on their own, but they also have such a perfectly endearing four way friendship. The sheer humanity of these characters is a truly stunning achievement. The level to which they all feel like ***literally real people*** is pretty much unmatched in terms of all the anime I’ve seen so far. Really only contested by the likes of Violet Ebergarden & A Place Further Than The Universe.

Despite not being THEE protagonist, Chitanda is undoubtedly the heart & soul of this show. She’d probably be my favourite character here if I really had to choose one. She has an absolutely magnetic personality, she gives us most of the anime’s funniest moments, and she also has quite a bit of depth once you get to know her more. She doesn’t have quite the same kind of long form character arc that most of the others have, nor are her mini-arcs nearly as huge or affectual as their’s, but she still has some pretty great moments of emotional intrigue all throughout. Most specifically during her initial quest to understand what happened to her uncle all those years ago, as well as the introspective conclusions that she comes to in the final episode, but I’ll talk more about that later. Wonderful character.

Hotaro was a surprisingly engaging main protagonist for the show in spite of the fact that his personal life goal in the beginning is literally a desire to be boring on purpose. But he’s so damn compelling precisely *because* of this character arc that forces him to abandon his “energy conservationist” ways; the journey between the “grey life” he’s been living & the “rosy life” that his friends are coaxing him into. It’s a transition that mostly happens because of Chitanda at the end of the day, but I’ll get more into that later. It was also really interesting to watch him grapple with the idea of whether or not his insane investigative abilities are actually worthy of acclaim. Vehemently denying it at first, later accepting it to the point where he becomes over confident; thus making a big mistake that shatters said confidence, but then by the end of the show finally accepting that he ***IS*** a great investigator, while also not letting that realization make him arrogant. Such a great character.

Much to my surprise, I found the character of Mayaka to be pretty relatable throughout the anime. Especially in terms of how she felt unappreciated in the Manga club & how she felt inadequate when comparing her work to the works of others. That definitely hits home for me. Feeling ignored in the company of certain people, as well as kind of pathetic when looking at the achievements of others. She was a very engaging character in that way.

And while we’re still on the topic of Mayaka, we also have the anime’s incredibly complex commentary on the idea of “expectations” as analyzed mostly through the lens of her & Satoshi. The core idea here being that: “When you actively put your expectations onto someone else, it also means that you’ve given up on yourself when it comes to that specific topic. This even has the potential to cause friction between friends & colleagues if they’re aiming for the same goal.”

When you tell someone that you expect them to write a great manga, it also means you’ve given up on writing a great manga. When you have high expectations for someone’s else’s investigative ability, it also means that you no longer have faith in your own. Regardless of whether or not these two are correct in their way of thinking, it did give ***ME*** a fair bit to think about, and it was still incredibly interesting to watch them wrestle with the idea & subsequently find a shared relatability over it. I still have a lot more to say about their relationship & Satoshi’s character specifically, but I’ll save that for later. For now, I wanna talk about the anime’s main story arcs & general mystery elements.

Whether they’re contained to a single episode, or persist throughout multi-episode arcs, the mysteries that comprise much of this show’s focus are ***so well done.*** I love how flawlessly & consistently they manage to make such seemingly mundane peculiarities into legitimately riveting detective stories. The mysteries here were often super complicated & a little hard to follow, but they’re always still extremely fun to figure out. The ones that significantly recontextualize previous events are especially cool to watch unfold. I often found myself rewinding to previous scenes in order to watch them again, now knowing everything that was at play. Sometimes even all the way back to previous episodes. It was so fun to witness how incredibly consistent & detailed this show is with it’s continuity.

That first arc about uncovering what happened to Chitanda’s Uncle was a really good way to kick off the show. It was really great seeing the Classics Club come together for the first time & start to carve out their collective identity as mystery solvers. The whole arc is very emotionally compelling when it comes to Chitanda’s character, and the actual reveal at the end of what the word “Hyouka” really means was genuinely harrowing. That incredible moment was the first time I knew this show was going to be something truly special.

The Student Film Arc was also really excellent. It definitely takes a while to get going, but it has some wonderfully riveting twists & turns later on that more than make up for the slow start. It’s within these episodes where we are introduced to the character of Irisu, and she proves herself to be a very interesting piece of this show. Especially as she relates to the ups & downs of Hotaro’s personal growth & whether or not he sees himself as special. The mystery that unfolds over the course of these 4 episodes engaged me in a way that very few stories have ever been capable of doing. I was irrevocably glued to the screen in the midst of it’s latter 2 episodes. I absolutely loved this arc. They recreated the look & feel of amateur student films FLAWLESSLY here.

And then you have what many consider to be the anime ’s centrepiece/magnum-opus. The sprawling & incredibly detailed “Juumonji/Festival Arc” that takes up a total of 6 episodes. And yeah… this arc is pretty damn awesome. It was consistently entertaining, incredibly interesting from a character perspective, and it’s all driven by a wonderfully complex main mystery. The eventual reveal of who Juumonji was ended up being a tad underwhelming, but the mystery itself was still extremely compelling all throughout, and it’s conclusion does A LOT thematically when it comes to our leads.

There’s also plenty of other awesome stuff to be found in this arc outside just the mystery. Satoshi’s escapades in his ridiculous costume were hilarious, Chitanda walking around & getting distracted by absolutely everything was equally hilarious, and that whole cooking competition was *without question* my favourite episode in the whole show. This entire sequence made me so unreasonably happy. ***Euphorically*** happy even. It’s one of the key fictional moments that helped bring me to the recent realization of the fact that I actually tend to enjoy watching platonic relationships **WAY MORE** than I do romantic ones. I obviously still love romances (even hyouka has 2 really great ones that we’ll be getting to shortly), but no fictional romance has ever made me even ***remotely*** as happy as seeing these four *friends* help each other through the cooking competition. It’s legitimately one of the greatest feelings that I’ve felt all year.

But on the complete opposite end of the emotional spectrum, Mayaka made me feel so damn sad for her throughout this arc. She goes through a lot of emotional turmoil here in order to progress her character arc. That moment where she very suddenly found a sense of relatability in the author of “Body Talk” (a girl she lowkeys despises), and then having this realization cause her to break down crying was pretty heart-rending to witness. I didn’t quite cry, but it still REALLY hit me, and seeing her confide in Satoshi afterwards was very emotionally satisfying. I love how their internal conflicts mirror each other in this arc & how they both find solace in it.

But briefly moving away from the plot & character dissection that I’ve been doing, I want to talk about the anime’s visuals because they are **EASILY** some of the best in televised animation history. The character animation & body language was absolutely incredible, as is *always* the case with KyoAni, but I also really loved all those abstract ideas & fun visual styles that they experimented with whenever expositing about a mystery. Scenes that would normally just be bland, shot-reverse-shot conversations instead become the absolute highlights of certain episodes. This show is incredibly ambitious with it’s visuals when it really didn't need to be, and I love that. I especially loved that scene where the environment of the cafe became visually altered in response to the first suggestion of a romance between Chitanda & Hotaro. The heart shaped pendulum that later revealed to just be a regular pendulum was such an amazing detail.

The anime also has quite a bit of great comedy. Drunk Chitanda was hilarious, Chitanda holding Irisu’s hand was even more hilarious, and the fact that one of the girls in the manga club literally cosplayed as Hatsune Miku for the school festival was always a hilarious detail for me. Yeah this show is WAY funnier than you would expect it to be given how it appears on the surface.

But now, let’s finally talk about the central romances of this anime, because I was incredibly moved by both of them. The “shipper-trash” part of my brain didn’t really start to go off until the show’s second half. It was triggered mostly by that 2nd ED which, in addition to being the best song in the series, was also some pretty overt shipping fuel. All those flustered looks sent me wild the first time I saw them. And the anime very much delivers on the promises of that ED.

I was initially most engaged by the Chitanda X Hotaro dynamic. The show made it incredibly clear in it’s very first episode that these two were almost certainly going to be a thing later on, and much to my delight, it only became more & more obvious over time. I absolutely loved that one episode where it was literally just the 2 of them, alone in the clubroom trying to solve a mystery based on next to no information. You know a show has amazing writing

when it can give you 2 characters in 1 room talking for 22 minutes and still have it be extremely engaging all throughout. A truly excellent piece of storytelling.

I also really enjoyed the somewhat unconventional way in which their relationship concludes. They don’t actually get together in the end. I found this to be extremely underwhelming at first, but the more I thought about it in the following days, I realized that they actually went about this in a super clever way. The ending may not definitively put them in a relationship, but it does present their dynamic in a way where it becomes an unquestionable fact that they will be getting together in the not so distant future. They will almost certainly be spending the rest of their lives together. This is all beautifully conveyed during the show’s final moments, all while subtly reaffirming what these two love most about each other. Chitanda finds Hotaro to be reliable & trustworthy in a way that she’s never experienced with anyone else, and for Hotaro, Chitanda was the primary force that helped bring excitement & colour into his boring ass existence. They’re an utterly perfect match for each other, and the show handled their relationship beautifully.

Satoshi & Mayaka are a far more complicated case however. More specifically, Satoshi is just an incredibly complicated character. At the time we first meet him in the show, he’s about a year now into this period of positive personal growth that he chose for himself to undergo. By means of his own introspection & determination, he’s become a much more laid back & pleasant person as opposed to the obsessive brat which he accurately declares his former self to be. But the sheer recency & very nature of this personal growth leads him to believe that a proper relationship with Mayaka has the potential to end disastrously. Neither of them have ever tried particularly hard to hide their love for each other, but Satoshi is afraid to actually date her because he’s afraid of how he’ll react to such a relationship. Afraid that his recently acquired “laid-back” persona will take her for granted & not put the appropriate amount of effort into the relationship. But even more so, he’s genuinely terrified by the idea that this relationship which he has desired for so many years might cause him to fall back into his old, more obsessive persona; where he very well might end up treating Mayaka like a prize to be hoarded instead of a person to be respected. Satoshi absolutely hates his former self, and if he ever were to fall back into his past toxicity, the last thing he wants is to take the girl he loves down with him.

Damn dude… Satoshi’s internal conflict here is ***easily*** one of the most fascinatingly complex & emotionally compelling internal conflicts that I have ever seen in fiction. He’s probably the most detailed character in the entire show. Fortunately for everyone involved, he eventually does realize that his infinite indecision is genuinely starting to hurt Mayaka, so in the penultimate episode, he finally calls her up to explain everything. I definitely wish that we got to hear some of this conversation, and that the actual status of their relationship was made a little more concrete in the finale, but it still seems like their dynamic is finally heading in a healthy & romantic direction. I’m very very happy for them, and while I do think that the anime’s main ship was far more narratively satisfying & overall well told, Satoshi X Mayaka has definitely become my favourite of the two. They are ***seriously*** underappreciated in the fandom. I checked out r/Hyouka immediately after completing the series, and it was quite the sorry sight. I sorted by top of all time, and for every ***ONE*** piece of Satoshi X Mayaka fanart, there were at least ***THIRTY*** pieces for Hotaro X Chitanda. These 2 need *so much* more attention you guys!

But that pretty much concludes all my thoughts on this spectacular show. Other than a few slight nitpicks, I seriously can’t thank of ***anything*** wrong with Hyouka… it’s kind of a masterpiece. The animation was breathtaking, the mysteries were consistently riveting, the characters were extremely well developed, their arcs & dynamics were incredibly interesting, and the anime was excellent at both comedy & drama. Just an absolute banger of a show. Through & through. Nothing but the best from Kyoto Animation!

# Why I will not be making a post about my 21st-30th anime:

So back in the intro of Part One, I hinted at there being another reason why it took me 14 months to get this post out, and that reason is the reviews themselves. My original post in 2022 was far shorter than this new series despite containing the exact same amount of shows, and that’s because it’s writing process was VERY different from the writing process of this 3 parter.

When I decided that I wanted to make that original post, all I did was wake up 10 mornings in a row & write out those reviews off the top of my head. There were a few days of editing it into it’s ideal form afterwards, but the whole process only took about two weeks… ***that was not at all the case for these new posts.***

Before even getting to my 11th anime, I already knew that I would eventually want to make an 11-20 post. My original 1-10 post was incredibly successful & gave me tons of great conversations & recommendations, so I was dead set on doing it all again! For the 11-20 post, I decided that I would record my thoughts in the form of rough notes as I went through each show, and then at the end of each show I’d turn those notes into the first draft of a proper review; with the intent to then go back & re-edit all of those review before finally releasing the 11-20 post. Partly because some of those shows were going to have new episodes come out before I hit my 20th anime, but also because my writing style is ever improving & I didn’t want to post something that doesn’t sound like “current me”.

I also made sure that the first draft reviews for each show were fully written BEFORE I would move on to the next show. This was where the first problem arose. My work ethic when it comes to making a cohesive read out of rough notes is pretty shit nowadays. I’m definitely glad that I went about it in this way because it gives everyone a **FAR** more comprehensive look at my opinions than just writing it off the top of my head, but it would still lead to often 2 week gaps between finishing one anime & starting another. Also keeping in mind that I was still watching A LOT of non anime, and also **ALSO** keeping in mind that I do way more in my day to day life than just watch shows. I have writing projects that don’t relate to anime at all, and the vast majority of my free time is actually spent on music related stuff. So yeah. It took me quite a while to get through all 10 of these shows.

Anyways, I also later decided that I was going to make some updates to my original 1-10 post because I’m a perfectionist to an unhealthy degree sometimes. This gave me a total of **TWENTY SEPARATE ANIME REVIEWS** that I had to go back and edit to “perfection”. I finished the first draft review of Hyouka back in December, and only TODAY have I finally finished touching up all 20 reviews. It only took so long because of all the same reasons as last time. *“Poor work ethic for this kind of writing & I do other things as well”.*

So yeah, after all of that, there is ***NO WAY IN HELL*** that I will be making a 21st - 30th anime post. I’m extremely proud of how this all came together & I hope to have many great conversations with all of you, but the very fact that I was working on this post at all prevented me from getting to more amazing shows as quickly as I could have. If I hadn’t been writing these reviews, I very well may have been on my 40th anime by now.

I’ve even gotten through 5 more anime since finishing Hyouka. Lycoris Recoil, Nichijou, Cowboy Bebop, Bocchi The Rock, & Banana Fish. I’m also currently in the middle of watching The Fire Hunter, Kaguya-Sama: Love Is War, & Girls’ Last Tour. I’ve had a much more enjoyable time with those shows not having to worry about writing anything down for them.

Even though I didn’t review them, I will still be including those 5 new shows in my overall ranking, and I will still **GLADLY** talk to anyone here about ANY of them. That is the primary objective behind this post after all. To start conversations.

242,Yowamushi Pedal: Is it worth it?,11q82hr,"Hello,

I am a big fan of sports anime. I loved Haikyuu, Major, Ace of Diamond, Kuroko, Run with the wind, Prince of Tennis, Baby Steps. On the other hand, I didn't like Hajime No Ippo so much (It's hard to explain why, but I found it a bit slow and long).

The strength of a sports anime is its characters, their development and especially the thrill you get when the sport is played. Major I knew nothing about baseball, I wanted to go and play it.

So I was wondering if Yowamushi Pedal was worth it? Opinions seem to be mixed: Some say it's slow, others seem to like it. I'm not a fan of cycling, but not at all.

Is it worth it or not according to you? Thanks.",_Rama_,60,0,0.3

I loved fruits basket even gave the final season a 10 but don't feel like watching the prelude movie. Its kind of annoying that i don't want too because i like finishing things I liked before trying a new show.

250,Yosuga no Sora - Anime of the Week,11pu7fc,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## Yosuga no Sora

Due to a sudden accident, twins Haruka and Sora Kasugano have lost both of their parents. Starting their lives anew, they return to their childhood home—living once again in the rural, quaint town like they did four years ago.

However, revisiting such a nostalgic place also means recalling all the memories the two of them made together, be it those that gave them blissful joy or those that made them suffer painful sorrow. Meeting both old acquaintances and new companions alike, the story of Haruka and Sora only gets more convoluted as their lives are slowly influenced by different acts of love, friendship, envy—and perhaps even lust.

Comments of the Day:

/u/ToastyMozart [pointed out a very important detail about Sakura's powers](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11oxxg3/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_46/jbv1h7w/):

>She's not the master of the Sun and Moon cards picking up Clow's leftovers anymore, she's got her own thing going and it makes her a bit more of an equal/third counterpart to Kero and Yue. Technically more like several billion Keros but whatever.

/u/No_Rex [mentioned a very interesting minor detail](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11oxxg3/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_46/jbv1hbo/):

>Clow Reed is the coincidences we saw – I like this idea, because it retroactively takes care of one of the biggest plot holes of the series: Why the clow cards are always active where Sakura is.

255,Why are romance animes either really good or really bad. its rare they are just mid,11psoiw,"i started watching romance animes since they tend to be shorter while waiting for others to come out and during this time ive watched 8 or so romances and alot of them have been really good but its been 2/3 that i just cant handle.

Ones i consider really good. (in order)

miss Nagatoro, love is war, tomochan is a girl, TONIKAWA: Over the Moon For You, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, komi cant communicate

Then the ones i really didnt like 

  bottom tier character tomozaki,  love, chunibyo & other delusions, it was one other but cant remember the name. 

in the ones my main complaints was the mcs was unlikable or made the better characters background characters.

256,Any thoughts on [High School DxD] ?,11ps6vo,"Hi, I just finished *High School DxD* 4th season now and it seems like the 5th season has been canceled but whatever I really enjoyed watching this anime all tho it was full of ecchi show but apart from romance and ecchiness the main story was hella interesting, well if I say I liked 3rd season Issei's fight the most when Asia was sent to other dimension and when he got pissed off, 4th season was also good but I don't like it when authors make the MC so weak and perverted. Due to some weaknesses and bad moments, I downrated this show so I'll give it 8/10. Well after all I did enjoy this anime a lot so what you guys think about it any thoughts? Btw I'd like to watch some more good similar plot animes if you wanna recommend...

Thanks 👋",Weeboo01,41,12,0.67
257,ONIMAI Episode 10 - Japanese Trivia and Nuances Lost in Translation,11ps173,"*For those that missed my previous posts, this is a post where I talk about some trivia on Japanese culture and some nuances that were lost in the translation from the Japanese audio to the English subtitles of the  newest episode of Onii-chan ha Oshimai! (ONIMAI:I'm Now Your Sister!). I'm using the subs from CrunchyRoll since it's probably the ones that most people watches the show with.*

*Disclaimer: This is only meant to be as interesting things that I wanted to share, and not as saying that the official translation was bad or wrong. Translations between two languages are often interpretations and translators tries to make a compelling story for their target audience. Also, I'm not a native speaker of either English or Japanese, so don't take anything I say as gospel.*

# Episode 10 ([Video format](https://youtu.be/uB6J4vJgIWA))

## Morning! [0m32]

At the beginning of this episode, Kaede used a greeting that was really popular in the very beginning of the 2000's: おっはー(ohhaa)

It's a contraction from the usual morning greeting: おはよう(ohayou).

The origin of it can actually be trace back to a morning's kid show that started airing on TV Tokyo in 1997: おはスタ(oha suta).

But what really made it popular and spread as a greeting was when it started getting used on the program サタ★スマ(sata suma) on FujiTV, by Katori Shingo when playing his character 慎吾ママ(Shingo Mama)

He's one of the member of probably the most well-known Japanese boys band: SMAP.

The quick spread was also greatly helped with it being used in a pretty catchy song that became a big hit 慎吾ママのおはロック(shingo mama no oha rokku)

It also won the 2000 New and Popular Word Award of U-CAN

Source: [https://www.jiyu.co.jp/singo/index.php?eid=00017](https://www.jiyu.co.jp/singo/index.php?eid=00017)

## You've got a point [3m18]

Asahi used a pretty common Japanese pun that was lost in the translation. When she said ""You've got a point"", in Japanese she said たしカニ(tashikani), which mean pretty much the same thing of ""It's true"", ""You are right"", but the word also ends with カニ(kani), which is the Japanese word for ""Crab"", and that's why you can see her [moving her fingers like a crab](https://imgur.com/a/CYdkcK6).

## Fujoshi [17m00]

I don't know how many people were already familiar with the term Fujoshi, that Miyo used in the library when talking with Mahiro, but this is something used to talk about a girl that really likes BL(BoysLove): romantic stories between guys.

In a literal sense it's a ""Rotten Girl""(腐女子).

This term comes from changing the first Kanji of 婦女子(fujoshi) ""Wife"", ""girl"".

The ""Rotten""(腐) Kanji was used as a self-deprecation to symbolize ""rotting"" your own mind when reading BL stories.

Source: [https://jp.quizcastle.com/dictionary/d1n7vx420w](https://jp.quizcastle.com/dictionary/d1n7vx420w)

## Down the rabbit hole [17m51]

The Japanese expression that was used by Mahiro after Miyo recommended a bunch of book that was translated into ""down the rabbit hole"", was 沼(numa), the Japanese word for a ""swamp"" that can also be used as a slang to talk about something to get obsessed about, to have a hard time getting out of.

## Brazen Hussy [21m57]

In the last scene of the episode, after the misunderstanding between Mahiro and the 2 boys of his class, Mahiro described himself as a 痴女(chijo), which was translated into ""brazen hussy"" in the subs from CrunchyRoll. Not sure how well this expression is known for native English speakers, but it was a first for me.

The Japanese term 痴女(chijo) is the female version of 痴漢(chikan), a word that I already explained in more details in [my post on the 3rd episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/10lfub6/onimai_episode_3_japanese_trivia_and_nuances_lost/), to talk about a molester.

It's written as ""Stupid""(痴) ""Woman""(女) but overtime the meaning changed to described a ""female molester"".",Toki_Madoushi,7,185,0.9
258,What fight scene in Anime had the best choreography?,11ps0jm," 

I think Madara vs everyone in the Naruto anime is definitely up there as one of the greats. Zoro vs Wano Samarui is very pleasing and fun to see considering One piece's fights were slideshows sometimes lol.

Hunter X Hunter was full of awesome directed fights, what's you guys favorites?",BathroomNew9406,152,88,0.91
259,Dealing with Diminishing Returns.,11prxgl,"I've been watching anime for almost eight years now and have dealt with many spats of burnout across that time. Turns out I'm pretty bad at not over-extending myself lol. However, recently I've been struggling with a different anime-related problem that I'm wondering if anyone else has struggled with.

I've noticed a degree of diminishing returns in my anime viewing habits that I can't seem to address. It's not that I'm not enjoying anime anymore, but that the amount of resources and effort it takes to maintain the same degree of engagement has started to become unsustainable. Maybe I just have ADD, but I'm the kind of guy that always likes having something to think about. I've spent an unreasonable amount of time scroll YouTube or Reddit looking for anything vaguely resembling an interesting thought to no avail or stared at the same AniList or MAL page multiple times hoping for something that sparks my interest to arise. It hasn't drastically affected my life, but enough to be noticeable to myself. 

Thinking that I was just bored with the mainstream, I started branching out into more and more ""obscure"" series but that then comes with a diminished amount of people to converse with on the subject and only exacerbates the amount of time I spend on trying to reign my thoughts in.

I'd like to know if anyone has had similar problems or has any advice for getting myself off this deleterious habit?

**TL;DR** I've noticed the amount of time I spend on anime-related activities to satisfy myself has reached unsustainable levels and I'm scared the problem is only getting worse. I want to know if anyone's had a similar issue and has any helpful tips for getting over it.",Salty145,10,2,0.56

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

First comment of the day goes to /u/biochrono79 

> The beginning of the first part of the episode had the most interesting implications for me. We never got to see not-Elaina’s face, but hairstyle (and chest) aside, she clearly has a strong enough resemblance to Elaina that people readily mistook Elaina for her. So either there’s some time-traveling nonsense happening, or that’s Niké and she actually looks very similar to Elaina, which has its own set of implications. Maybe Niké and Elaina are related somehow?

> The second part of the episode was clearly written for a very… specific audience. Those villagers were thirsty, and not for the wine specifically. The chief in particular was very open about his fetish, and he was definitely speaking for the other villagers. That aside, it was amusing to see Elaina set aside her tendency to not get overly involved in the funniest way possible. Elaina’s laugher while she was bombarding the villagers with grapes was priceless. Drunk witches are just too powerful, and the villagers got their grapes crushed by a cute girl, although not quite in the way they wanted, so everyone walked away more or less happy with themselves.

Second comment goes to /u/Refugee_Savior

> The wall episode seems like it’s extremely on the nose. Nice short tie in to get some more relevance to the Witch of Travels.

> I get the feeling that this whole episode is just a euphemism for those that want a dommy mommy to step on them. Not that I’m complaining.

> I’m surprised Elaina didn’t just take Rosemary out immediately for her comments. They got under her skin so easily.

> Drunk Elaina is definitely best Elaina. She’s an absolute joy when she’s committing grape fueled war crimes.

* The biggest surprise would be Yamazaki who after 7 weeks without a single vote achieved to earn 6 votes and jumped to tenth place **BUT** Zenzo beat him to it with raising from 0 votes to 7 votes and secured to himself a 9th place. It seems having hemorrhoids has its benefits.

**Regarding spoilers:**

Rewatchers please dont talk without using spoiler tags \[Spoilers\] >!like this!< about events which still didn't happen in anime, don't name characters that weren't introduced yet, don't post pictures of characters yet to be introduced and try to refrain from using arcs and episodes names yet to be introduced.

*DON'T EVEN TRY TO BE VAGUE THINKING YOU ARE SO CLEVER AND NO ONE WILL CONNECT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER LIKE SAYING IT WOULD BE SHAME IF YOUR LOCAL POST OFFICE SENT YOU A BOMBASTIC LIST. JUST. USE. SPOILERS TAGS. LIKE THIS* \[Spoilers\] >!https://i.imgur.com/nojEEcg.png!<

There will be first watchers discussing it together with us and I believe nobody here wants them to be spoiled.

If you want to talk about something you noticed on your rewatch, which is hinting about future events hid it properly underneath the spoilers like the fact \[Spoilers\] >!that the information hidden in this spoiler is totally pointless.!<

**QUESTIONS FOR YOU:**

Instead of a questions, i have a **IMPORTANT THING TO SAY.**

Next week we are going to watch Yagyu arc with a new OP and new ED and i **STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO NOT WATCH THE NEW ED UNTIL WE REACH EPISODE 80 (You can watch the ED on episode 80 without worries)**

I won’t tell you why i recommend to skip that ED for few episodes, but there is a reason and i wish someone would tell me about it when i was first watching Gintama.

**Or as** u/b0bba_Fett **summarised the issue with ED 7, here is a better explanation why i decided to recommend to skip ED7 for a few episodes:**

And as an extension of the Spoiler warning for ED 7, I agree the warning is worth putting out there, but the twist isn't super important, and odds are you'll have figured it out well before episode 80, so if you think you've got the arc's twist figured out, feel free to watch it, as it's a Top 3 Gintama ED easy.",Shocketheth,122,72,0.95

For example is Zenitsu from Demon Slayer. Divisive at best in the West and considered annoying when not asleep but is the most popular character in Japan and some even attributed the series not getting an early axe because of his first proper introduction arc and spotlight. As an inverse there's Mirio from MHA.

Hello there. This is Part Two in a massive project where I rank & review all 10 anime that I’ve watched since I talked about my first 10 anime back in 2022. I highly recommend reading Part One first. It contains a more in depth preamble, as well as my thoughts on Usagi Drop, A Place Further Than The Universe, Komi Can’t Communicate, & Star Wars: Visions

I will first be going over my thoughts on each of these shows individually, in the order that I watched them. Then at the end of tomorrow’s Part Three, I will rank every single one of them. And please remember the following: The **biggest reason** why I’m making this post at all is so that I can talk about all of these shows with as many of you as possible. So ***please,*** if you want to share your thoughts on any of these shows, and/or give me your opinions on MY opinions, I implore you to do so in the comments below. I’m all ears. And for the record, I don’t expect anyone to read every single one of these reviews. Just look around for the shows you care about

But now, let's talk about some anime!

# A Lull in the Sea:

My enjoyment of this show had some very distinct ups & downs. The first 4-ish episodes weren’t really hooking me, but it did start to pick up right around then, and I was genuinely LOVING this show during it’s middlest episodes. Everything surrounding the show's massive mid-season twist was extremely well told. Both the immediate lead up & the immediate aftermath. But as the anime died down from that insanity & started to wrap up, it became increasingly “OK” where it had once been “excellent”. It’s a bit of a mixed bag series, but I definitely still enjoyed the overall experience.

The quality of any given episode here is almost directly proportional to how close it is to the beautifully harrowing EP13. That episode genuinely shook me to my core. It was extremely unpredictable & I absolutely loved it. And the closer you are to that episode, the more engaging that the story is likely to be.

Another thing I loved about this show was how well fleshed out the world was. There’s a decently in depth exploration here of how these 2 different yet intrinsically parallel cultures develop & co-exist right next to each other, as well the tensions that this existence inevitably causes on both a societal & interpersonal level. I wish the show went just a little further with it’s commentary on societal divides, but it was still a really cool angle that I was NOT expecting to see from this show.

The anime was also pretty great on a technical level. It definitely took me a while to get used to some of these character designs, but the show really does look beautiful on the whole. Amazing background art, very fluid movement, and lots of incredibly well done facial expressions as well. In spite of the fantastical setting, most everything about this series is presented in a very grounded & tonally consistent way. There are no moments of ill fitting generic comedy or bizarrely exaggerated animation that break my immersion. This show has a very consistent sense of realism & it does wonders for making these characters feel more human.

I’d also like to mention quickly that I really liked the anime’s score. Most specifically that reversed piano track, as well as that super melancholic piece based around a lovely, somewhat muted acoustic guitar. I definitely need to properly seek those two out sometime, but now let’s get into the show’s most important element, that being the characters… of which I have A LOT to say about.

Hikari underwent some very compelling progression throughout the show. I was fairly certain that I was going to hate him judging by the first few episodes, but I eventually came to really like his character. I enjoyed seeing his journey of becoming a more thoughtful & less overprotective person. How he becomes more accepting of the surface people & a little more open about his own emotions. I also really liked how this progression wasn’t immediate. It was a very difficult process for him to undergo, and his intense fear of change after awakening to a post-hibernation world was also very interesting to explore. I do wish that his relationship with Manaka was made more definitive by the end, but I’ll get more into that later.

My favourite character in the show’s first half was easily Akari. I found her side of the story to be very emotionally compelling, and she was just extremely likeable as well. All of the complicated teen romance in this show can occasionally become overly dramatic & not terribly interesting, but Akari’s very mature & down to earth romance with Itaru was always incredibly engaging to follow & refreshingly adult… because they’re adults. Something about the understated struggle that’s inherent to their relationship was consistently gripping for me. The subtle layer of tragedy behind their whole dynamic, the divides caused by pressure from their cultural traditions, and their beautifully realized family dynamic post-time-skip made that entire subplot feel so incredibly human. The romance here may be between Akari & Itaru, but the crux of this whole side-plot very much exists in the newfound parental relationship between Akari & Miuna. Muina being another one of my favourite characters.

Her inability to accept Akari’s relationship with her father after the recent death of her real mother was incredibly sad to watch. But it was even sadder to see such a young child come to the conclusion that *“It’s not worth loving people because it hurts when you lose them”.* I love that Hikari is the one to successfully re-convince Miuna of the worth of love, only for her to then say all of the same things back to him 5 years later, while he is in the midst of his new found pessimism around the concept. I probably should have seen that coming, but I love that they managed to surprise me with such a genius call back. The eventual resolution between Miuna & Akari was also really beautifully done; their Mother/Daughter dynamic after the time skip was perfect. I didn’t love everything about Miuna’s character however. Her “unrequited love for Hikari” subplot was never actively annoying, but it also didn’t feel terribly necessary. They definitely could have given Miuna a more interesting arc for the show’s 2nd half.

Speaking of that 2nd half, my favourite character ***there*** was definitely Chisaki. She was already pretty good in the anime’s first half, but she kinda ended up fading into the background more often than not. Her unrequited feelings for Hikari & paralysing fear of change were already interesting enough, but it’s only when her entire world is suddenly & **radically** altered in EP13 where she becomes an incredibly compelling character. That five year long, silent montage of her having no choice but to live with Tsumugu in the aftermath of the Ofunehiki is probably the best scene in the entire show. Seeing her slowly start to become happy again while knowing about the painful sadness that still looms over her was genuinely harrowing to witness. I definitely found myself shipping her with Tsumugu by the end of the show, and while that does seem to be the ending’s implication, I wish that they had been a little more definitive with it. Again, we’ll get into the ending a little later.

Manaka & Tsumugu are two characters that I honestly don’t have a whole lot to say about. They’re both decently likeable & I definitely shipped them early on, but generally, these two were only at their best whenever the show was exploring their dynamics with other characters. They weren’t particularly compelling by their own merits, which is especially unfortunate in the case of Manaka because she’s kind of the crux of the entire show. Watching her finally realize that she’s literally lost the ability to love did make for an excellent scene, but she’s still one of the show’s least interesting characters for me. And then you have Tsumugu, a character who’s only significantly engaging element was his relationship with Chisaki. He’s a great character for bringing out lots of interesting things in the other characters, be **HE** really only became less & less interesting as the story progressed.

I have very mixed feelings on Kaname as well. He was a pleasant enough character in the first half, who’s unrequited feelings for Chisaki were certainly sad to some degree. The fact that he’s so frank when talking about his romantic feelings was a very interesting piece of characterization, but his fixation on Chisaki & resulting resentment towards Tsumugu in the anime’s 2nd half was really annoying & tedious. This desperation of his felt VERY out of character given how he had previously acted in the show, but they somehow managed to make his character work again at the last minute by establishing a very interesting connection between him & Sayu. Kaname lamenting the fact that he felt no one was waiting for him on the surface, only for Sayu to tell him that’s EXACTLY what she’s been doing for 5 years made for one of the most unexpectedly compelling moments in the whole show. I like how their relationship ended up in the show. Nothing has “started” yet, but they both know that they care about each other so that’s cool.

Sayu herself was a very fun character as well. She has an excellent dynamic with Miuna, she has an enjoyably spunky personality, she’s generally quite adorable, and she’s the funniest character in the show BY FAR. That scene where she (a 9 year old at the time) tries to chloroform (the teenage) Hikari while also being a naive child who doesn’t understand how chloroform works was absolutely hilarious. Her default sense of sass & groundedness led to several other funny moments throughout the show, and I also got surprisingly wrapped up in her unrequited love for Kaname despite my mixed feelings on that character. But **FINALLY…** Let's move on from the characters.

As previously stated, I really liked the world building in this show… that is except for one thing. The Properties of Ena. It started off as a very appreciable simplification of mermaid stuff, but it’s exact abilities became far too overly convenient as the show went along. Miuna gaining it made enough sense given her lineage, but Tsumugu gaining it was definitely a stretch in my opinion. He was clearly only given Ena because the plot needed him to go underwater. Not for any reason that was actually significant to his character. Also that whole “Ena=Emotions” thing that they added near the end felt **SO** vaguely defined, and I really didn’t know what to make of it.

I also found it rather strange how the anime was apparently supposed to have this looming threat of a decades long, apocalyptic winter, but outside of 1 or 2 brief conversations, this threat never felt remotely tangible or… threatening. It felt like a complete afterthought in all honesty. I did quite like how they handled the main theme of “change” though. It was very thoroughly & complexly explored through many different characters & perspectives, and I enjoyed how different characters came to different conclusions on the topic.

As for the show’s ending? It was pretty ok I guess. I didn’t dislike where any of the plots or characters ended up, but they ***definitely*** could’ve presented that final episode in a far more satisfying way. **ONE KISS** between any of the main couples here would have been perfect for making the ending feel a lot more complete. On the whole though, “A Lull in The Sea” was still pretty good. It had it’s fair share of weaknesses, for sure, but it definitely had a far higher amount of enjoyable elements that made it a very worthwhile experience. Nothing mind blowing, but still a good anime.

# Ranking of Kings:

I ultimately don’t have a whole lot to say about this show. At least not compared to most of the other anime on this list. I definitely liked it overall & also had some problems with it, but I don’t feel particularly passionate about any of my praises or criticisms here. I’ll still go over them though.

I love this show’s art style. It’s wonderfully cartoon-y in a way that is quite unlike any of the other anime I’ve seen so far. It’s all super stylized, but also very effectively brutal when it needs to be, and the animation in some of these action scenes is genuinely spectacular. The final showdown between Boji & Boss was especially jaw dropping. I also really liked the show’s world building. It’s all very stereotypical mediaeval fantasy stuff, but it’s still very well presented & always satisfying to learn more about; there’s tons of interesting lore here.

Boji & Kage were both pretty decent protagonists. Their motivations & backstories were very interesting, seeing them grow & change together was always compelling, and their overall dynamic was just super believable & fun. I also really loved the hella creative way in which they made Boji more “powerful” without contradicting the fact that it is literally/physically impossible for him to grow stronger. It was an incredibly clever solution from a lore & narrative standpoint

I really enjoyed what they eventually did with the characters of Daida & Hilling as well. They were nothing more than unlikeable assholes in the beginning who did nothing but belittle Boji, but Hilling slowly reveals herself to be a much more sympathetic & loving character than she initially lets on, all while Daida is forced to undergo a **massive** change of heart. Letting go of his ego, learning to be generally kinder, eventually and coming to accept & respect Boji for who he is. Both very well done characters overall.

“The Big Four” as they call themselves were some of my favourite side characters. Bebin & his snakes were super cool, Dorshe’s intense dedication to Hilling made for a very interesting dynamic, Apeas’ constant internal struggle with loyalty was pretty compelling, and Domas was given a really good character arc over the course of the show. I also quite enjoyed the friendship between him & Hokuro. They were an engaging duo.

But my favourite character in the show, the ones that compelled me the most, were definitely the 3 Brothers of the Underworld. Despa was consistently weird but in a **VERY** likeable way, Desha was kinda cool & will probably make for a very interesting villain next season, and Oaken is one of the most genuinely terrifying beings that I’ve ever seen in anime… but he’s also so insanely tragic. He clearly didn’t want to become this horrid immortal monster, and it’s so terrible yet hopeful to think that he might still be in there. Despa & Desha clearly have their differences on a geopolitical & moral level, but I love that they’re 100% united in the goal of wanting to save their brother whatever horrible curse he’s under. I really loved that side of the story.

But as stated in the opening, I do have some definite problems with this show, and those issues lie mostly within the characters of Boss & Miranjo. First of all, what the hell even were Boss’s motivations? He goes back & forth so many times between being an irredeemable asshole, and then suddenly being kind of tragic & sympathetic. None of which is written or presented in a way that makes him feel layered or complex, it’s just super messy & inconsistent. By the end of the show, I truly did not understand what his deal was.

Miranjo was an incredibly interesting presence throughout most of the show, and she had a wonderful air of mystery about her, but she also had many of the same inconsistencies that Boss did. While it was to a lesser extent, her motivations & morality ended up being extremely confusing. She had a ton of cool scenes & was a pretty compelling main villain for the most, but what the **HELL** were they thinking with her “redemption” at the end there? I don’t even think this deserves to be called a redemption. Given all of the horrible shit she’s done, a proper redemption for this character would need to be a several episode story arc, NOT ONE SINGULAR SCENE. I’m sure that the consequences of her actions & her deeper morality will be explored in S2 to some degree, but as for what they did with her in this season’s finale? It felt cheap, it felt rushed, & it felt forced. Didn’t like it.

In spite of 2 key characters having some very sloppy writing, Ranking Of Kings was still a pretty good show. It’s far from being a new favourite of mine or anything to that effect, but it was generally solid & I’ll definitely be watching S2 whenever it comes out.

# Dr. Stone:

I liked this show a lot more than I thought I was going to. I don’t have a particular structure in mind for this review, so I’m just gonna go over my various thoughts & opinions in whatever order they come to me.

The initial petrification of the world in EP1 actually made for a legitimately chilling scene. It left me genuinely taken aback & immediately engaged in the show. However, it took quite a while for me to become truly engaged again after that point. During those first 6 episodes where the show was exclusively about these 4 newly awakened humans from the old world… I really couldn’t bring myself to care about what was happening. They all felt extremely generic & the plot really wasn’t doing anything for me.

But then we’re introduced to Ishigami village in EP7 and the show finally becomes interesting again. I’m not even 100% sure why, but all of the characters here felt so much more engaging & fun than the peeps from the first batch of episodes. I became endeared to the majority of them almost immediately.

I liked Kohaku the moment she entered the show, and I’d probably consider her my favourite character after having now seen both seasons. She’s not especially deep or anything, I just think she’s cool, really. I like her stubborn yet loyal personality, I like the fact that she’s humble enough to admit her complete lack of scientific comprehension while still doing her best to help, and her quest to heal her sister all throughout S1 was pretty emotionally compelling.

Speaking of her sister, I really do wish that Ruri had been given a lot more development. Other than the intrigue of what she knows about Senku & the potentially interesting romance between her & Chrome, she really hasn’t done anything to make herself interesting yet. She hasn’t been fleshed out nearly as well as such a plot relevant character should be. Here’s hoping S3 improves her.

I really did like Chrome though. He goes through a very effective arc over the course of these first 2 seasons. At first being extremely jealous **of** & infinitely frustrated ***by*** Senku’s very existence, before eventually coming to accept the fact that Senku is far more intellectually skilled than he ever has any hope of being. It was also really great to see Senku eventually come to respect & admire Chrome for the great amount of intelligence that he does still have. Despite one of them obviously being smarter, they basically start to treat each other as equals & it makes for a really fun friendship between the 2 of them.

I guess I should finally talk specifically about the MAIN character here because he actually significantly grew on me after those first few episodes. For a while there, he seemed to be nothing more than a smart-ass egotist with no emotional attachment to anything and who probably just wanted glory or something boring like that. He was consistently **fun** to watch for his insane intellect, but leaps & bounds away from being an engaging ***character.*** But as the anime goes on, we are made privy to the fact that Senku isn’t just some totally detached super-genius despite probably wanting to appear that way. He’s still human.

He was genuinely invested in healing Ruri as more than just a way to prove his abilities. He forms genuine bonds with the likes of Chrome & Kaseki. He strives for a bloodless conflict throughout the entire series & very clearly has an immense value for human life. The constant flashbacks sell us on the fact that he & Taiju do have a genuine connection, and then you also have that whole situation with his Dad which I will talk about in a later paragraph. Overall, Senku is a very engaging protagonist.

My absolute favourite element of this anime would have to be the immense satisfaction you get from watching their gradual scientific progression over the course of the show. I do have some serious doubts regarding the accuracy & **especially** the efficiency of it all, but the fact that it’s even ***remotely*** believable in the first place still makes for some of the most intellectually engaging & fun scenes that I’ve ever found in an anime. The series is extremely well paced in that regard.

My biggest *problem* with this show would have to be the comedy though. Despite a handful of genuinely super moments here & there, this show’s attempts at humour generally fall flat quite for me. Pretty much every attempt at physical and/or visual comedy here did nothing but ruin my immersion in the world, and thus, annoy me. The anime’s funniest moment BY FAR was in an instance of spoken comedy. *“I like the kinda girl who can pump a ton of oxygen into a furnace”.* That line REALLY made me laugh.

Oh, and one more thing while we’re still on the topic of the show’s comedy… ***I hope “Mecha-Senku” gets curb-stomped & thrown into a dumpster, never to be seen again.*** The whole concept of that “character” was so unfathomably lame & horrifically superfluous. It’s a running joke that completely shattered my immersion in the anime whenever they decided to try and shove it down my throat. That was the absolute worst…

While the comedic failings here are unfortunate, the anime is thankfully very strong on an emotional level. The first moment that genuinely got to me was when Suika tried on her new glasses for the first time. It didn’t make me cry, nothing in this show got me THAT far, but it was definitely a far more powerful moment than I was anticipating.

The most emotionally compelling stuff in this series BY FAR has so far been all the stuff with Senku’s Dad, Byakuya. Those flashback episodes where we witness the fall of humanity from the perspective of a bunch of astronauts were easily favourites in the whole show. They managed to make that whole crew shockingly compelling in a very short amount of time, and the way in which they tied it all back to Ishigami village made for an immensely satisfying reveal, but the highlight of this whole ordeal was definitely Byakuya’s message to Senku. The fact that his message was both genuinely heartfelt & yet super comedic; creating a beautiful sort of juxtaposition that he knew would connect with his son was so perfectly done. And seeing Senku actually become super emotional over something for once made ***me*** super emotional as well. Everything surrounding Byakuya in this anime was peak fiction.

Lastly, I need to talk about Tsukasa, because he became one of the show’s very best characters in the last leg of S2. Throughout most of the anime, he works well as a decently threatening antagonist who has a very interesting ideological clash with Senku. Senku is obviously in the right at the end of the day, but Tsukasa’s desire to rebuild the world only with those who are “uncorrupted” does make some level of sense. The problem lies in the fact that he associates a person’s corruption ***FAR*** too closely with their age. He sees those 2 metrics as being directly proportional, which is obviously not true at all. As is proven here by characters like Kaseki & Byakuya.

But there’s a twist that arrives in the final few episodes of the S2 which actually turns Tsukasa into an incredibly sympathetic character. The reveal that his “new-world-vision” was only a secondary goal behind that of saving his younger sister added quite a lot of depth to him. That whole plot point was VERY out of nowhere, but it still managed to be remarkably effective on an emotional level. Especially because of how it created a meaningful parallel between him & Kohaku. His goodbye to Senku before being put on ice was an excellent scene, and that high five between the 2 of them after defeating Hyoga was easily THEE most satisfying high five I have ever witnessed in fiction. Overall, a shockingly well done redemption arc for a character who seemed pretty clear-cut evil for the longest time.

Dr. Stone was a really great anime, all things considered. I liked most of the characters & their dynamics, the show is great at building upon it’s core concept in hugely satisfying ways, and it was all very strong emotionally whenever it went for stuff like that. The generally weak comedy did make me like it less than I might have otherwise, but it obviously doesn't *RUIN* things. I liked this anime quite a bit.

# Spy X Family:

*(the vast majority of this review was written when only the first half of the season had come out, but i will provide a few quick thoughts on the second half at the end of the review.)*

Even though I wouldn't put this show in my Top 5 Anime all things considered, I can still confidently say that I have never in my life fallen in love with a show so immediately. EP1 was already quite fun, but by the time I got to “The Grenade Pin Proposal” in EP2… ***I was absolutely sold & already mildly obsessed with this thing.*** The show so far definitely has peaked with it’s first 5 episodes, but there’s still a ton of great stuff to talk about here. The sheer amount of joy that this series fills me with is truly unparalleled.

One of the most impressive aspects of this show is how insanely engaging it manages to be in spite of how predictable it is. As soon as Yor joins the picture, you know pretty much exactly how this is all going to play out. *They’re all going to act like a loving family out of necessity while telling themselves that they don’t actually care about each other, but as the show goes on, it will become increasingly obvious that they’ve all come to legitimately love each other; whether they realize it or not. Even though they’re all flagrantly lying to each other on a daily basis, the bonds that they form will be genuine.* That’s exactly what happens… **AND IT’S AMAZING.** None of it is even remotely surprising or unexpected, but I was still absolutely riveted throughout all 12 of these episodes.

It’s especially engaging from Anya’s perspective because she actually knows everything that’s going on. Her telepathy is pretty much the only reason this show works in the first place. If all 3 of them were *completely* in the dark about one another, the story wouldn’t flow nearly as well as it does, and a ton of the comedy would be lost. They’ve written an utterly perfect 3 way dynamic here, and it’s just so amazingly entertaining to watch develop.

But yeah, Anya was a really enjoyable character. She’s insanely cute, consistently funny, and probably the most emotionally compelling character due to the immense amount of importance that she places in her family. Twilight & Yor still have lives they can go back to if this whole charade falls apart, but this family is pretty much the only thing Anya has, and her fierce determination in doing everything that she possibly can in order to maintain the Forgers is really admirable & engaging.

She gets most of the anime's funniest moments, for sure. Her various reaction faces are obviously iconic, but she has some amazingly funny lines all throughout as well. The funniest one for me would have to be that scene in EP9 where she’s briefly startled awake by a loud noise and says “Is it the end of the world?” before immediately falling back asleep. ***That scene absolutely slayed me.*** She also gets some pretty hilarious moments whenever she’s at Eden Academy. I especially loved her complete failure to succeed in dodgeball. Her exact levels of intelligence & maturity do feel bizarrely inconsistent for the sake of the story sometimes, but I still love Anya.

Twilight was a very engaging character as well. He’s had by far the most tangible development out of anyone here. Which I guess isn’t particularly surprising given the fact that he is the main protagonist. I love how he slowly comes to the realization that he needs to be a ***legitimately good father*** to Anya in order for Operation Strix to work at all. It has to be more than an act, and seeing him loosen up & become a kinder person while the very realization of this change also stresses him the hell out was very emotionally investing & fun to witness. He’s a great character.

And so is Yor! The insane dichotomy of her existence is so much fun to watch. An extremely socially inept master assassin who loves her job is not a combo that I’ve ever seen before. Her frequent hyper-fixation on sharp stuff is hilarious, her efforts to be a good mom for Anya are always unbearably adorable, and her dynamic with Twilight is immensely engaging for obvious reasons. I cannot wait for their relationship to eventually evolve into a legitimate romance one day, because who the hell **wouldn’t** ship these 2? I also really like her character design. The Thorn Princess suit looks super badass, but her casual attire is also… idk, powerfully comfy? It’s a look that emanates comfiness. I love it.

My only real issue with her character is that she hasn’t been given nearly enough to do yet. I REALLY wanna see more of her assassin work, because that action scene in EP2 was fantastic. I’m also very eager to explore the fact that she’s been in this line of work since she was a ***teenager.*** All in order to support her brother. There’s a lot that you could delve into with her orphaned childhood, and I really hope this character gets more focus in the future.

Speaking of her brother though, Yuri is a very annoying character for me. It’s plain to see that this is definitely the point to some degree, and I am eternally grateful that the anime is smart enough to portray him crushing on his sister as a **very weird thing,** but that still doesn’t mean I enjoy watching him in any capacity. We’ll see how it all plays out in the end, but him being such an eccentric threat in the show has felt like a very unnecessary addition thus far. It doesn’t really add anything.

But on the whole? “Spy x Family” is still an excellent series. It’s remarkably funny, staggeringly wholesome, and insanely well animated. The core cast is incredibly likeable, and the ever present threat of world war that must be prevented manages to give the show a great sense of suspense in the midst of all it’s goofiness. Such a fun anime. Very hyped for the rest of the season next October!

**SOME QUICK THOUGHTS ON SEASON 1B:**

Here’s the thing; These 13 episodes certainly weren’t bad. I still enjoyed every single one of them to some degree, and I still really like this show overall… but S1B has definitely made me like the show noticeably less. It’s not nearly as good as the first half of the season, and the potential cracks caused by the limits of this show’s concept are very much starting to show. But let’s talk positives first!

These 13 episodes contain two separate 3 part arcs. “The Dog Terrorism Arc” from episodes 13-15, and “The Nightfall Tennis Arc” from episodes 21-23. These episodes were all legitimately amazing. No complaints, Peak Spy Family, I loved them. The bomb threat created a heightened sense of tension that the show has never had before, The Handler got to be a beautifully terrifying badass when she kicked in the teeth of that one terrorist whilst describing the horrors of war, and then you had the shenanigans of Anya & Bond which were such a joy to watch. Nightfall is a very fun addition to the cast who is also a little sad, the animation during the certain parts of that wonderfully absurd tennis match was Demon Slayer levels of enthralling, and Yor’s poignant sense of jealousy upon seeing Nightfall with Twilight was really compelling to explore. Again, these were all excellent episodes.

The problem here is with the 5 episodes (+E24) that exist between those two spectacular arcs. That problem being the fact that this split episode format kinda sucks. I’ve seen it work perfectly for other shows, even some of my all time favourites like “Amphibia”, but it’s such an unnatural fit for Spy Family in my opinion.

There were few worthwhile stories here, such as the incredibly wholesome “Yor’s Kitchen”, the bafflingly hilarious “Daybreak”, and even “Uncle, The Private Tutor” which actually made Yuri a tolerable character for once. But the vast majority of these split episode narratives are forgettably pleasant at best & a **COMPLETE** waste of time at worst. There are some genuinely good moments here & there, but I wish they’d been incorporated into one of the ***full*** episodes instead of being relegated to these segments that are rarely given enough time to develop into anything doesn’t ultimately feel like aimless filler.

Another big frustration I have is that Yor STILL feels insanely underutilized, but even more unfortunate than that is how ridiculously repetitive she’s gotten. We’ve had like 4 separate instances now where her self doubt gets so bad that she becomes utterly convinced she should just leave the family. But then every single time, Twilight and/or Anya will reassure her in no uncertain terms that she belongs in the Forger family. It was incredibly adorable the first few times, but it’s getting SO OLD now, and it makes Yor feel like a poorly written character that the creators have no idea what to do with. Apparently she has some really good stuff coming up in S2, so I pray to God that’s true.

So yeah. Spy X Family is still a super fun show, but it’s become incredibly evident that it cannot go on forever. This is a story that needs to END sooner than later if it wants to remain good. If we get to the end of say… Season Three with still no end in sight for Operation Strix & no truths revealed in the family, then I am going to be kinda pissed.

# That’s the end of Part Two!

I originally had a **STRONG** desire to release all 3 of these posts at once, but it would seem that release method is not allowed for whatever reason, so begrudgingly, I will giving time between all 3 posts. I already told you what Part One contains back in the introduction, but Part Three (which I will be releasing tomorrow) contains my thoughts on “Carole & Tuesday”, my thoughts on “Hyouka”, as well as my overall rankings & an explanation as to why I will not be making a post about my 21st-30th anime.

295,We really need shorter anime titles to recommend newcomers with.,11p3hqy,"So there was this tweet running around where someone had asked actor Michael B. Jordan on what anime he would recommend newcomers to watch in order to get them into the medium.  His answer is basically what many people would expect: ***Naruto***, ***Dragon Ball***, ***One Piece***, all the good favorites, after all.  However, it caused a lot of people to start scratching their heads...and yeah, I can't help but scratch my head as well.  Really?  We're going to ask newcomers to get into anime that have 1000s upon 1000s of episodes on top of each other?  As a ***starting point???***  With the sheer amount of commitment you'd have to put in for just ONE series, they'll be turned off halfway through the first season!  Honestly, I'd argue that these titles should instead be ***""endgame titles""***: anime that you'd only give newcomers that are definitely in for the ride and want to get into the history of anime.

So now I can't help but wonder, and then ask the rest of this community: what short, semi-modern show do you think we can use to show people who want to get into anime?  We can debate if a ""short series"" means either 12 episodes or stretch to as far as 24.

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

First comment goes to /u/hiimneato who needs to get more sleep

> Who's that sleepy boy who crashed directly after work yesterday and slept through episode 5's discussion thread? Sou, watashi *yaaaawn\* desu.

> Oh maaaaan I had forgotten about the land of truth-tellers and the king's fucking absurd sword! This is a goofy weirdo episode and I quite like it. Oh! And it's finally time we reunite with Saya! That's, uh... that's... well, it's extremely awkward, but at least it's funny. I cracked up during the back-and-forth staredown.

> I tend to be pretty quiet, and I have a lot of noncommittal, non-fact-based responses in my conversational repertoire since I work in an industry where I don't have much in common with most of the people I'm around, so I think I could get by fine. The problem - and I think this is where a lot of people would stumble - would be if and when somebody else said something shitty to me. I am non-confrontational and I get the impression that someone who wasn't willing to fight would end up being everybody's verbal punching bag in a land where everyone needed and outlet for their negativity.

> Well, at least now we know Elaina's high opinion of herself is entirely honest. Wish I had that kind of confidence.

> ""I wonder why people who are trying to accomplish big things end up giving up their voices or memories in exchange...?"" metatextual fairy tale joke lol, suck it, hans christian anderson you hack. Poor Eihemia. She's a great gag character, though.

>I really do think this is the funniest episode of the series. ""But, man, this sword is really lame."" bwahahahaha this episode is just chock full of people clowning on things by saying the stuff that the audience is thinking. (The ceremony and the effects of the sword actually looked pretty cool.) And the look Elaina gave Saya when she suggested the king might have kicked Eihemia out because she was just a little too much, heck. And, and. I was earnestly following Elaina's exchange with the King about the value of lies, but for the life of me I couldn't hold in the giggles at the sound of Saya bullying the guards in the background.

>""Your feelings are overwhelming."" Yep, that's Saya in a nutshell. Bless her heart. Ah, and I just noticed that she's a boku girl, which certainly check out. It's... it's kinda impossible not to like her and feel for her when she's trembling with tears in her eyes and trying to be strong when they have to part ways, though. She's a good girl, she's just... kinda dumb and extremely needy. Whoops, was that too honest?

>On a general note, I still feel like there's a lot going on in this show in terms of cinematography and production that I'm noticing subconsciously but not quite picking out well enough to comment on it.

Second comment of the day goes to /u/ZapsZzz

> Firstly, some thoughts that particularly stood out:

* this is a mostly comical episode, both in the tone and the setup. I'm saying that because the way the guards come out with the ""truths"" basically it's like people who are already fed up and gone to the state of ""malicious compliance"", to use that condition as a cover to the venting passive aggression.

* loved the silent and repeated camera cutting between Elaina and Saya with Elaina keeping mostly to the ""this is unavoidable"" face to the changing Saya expressions :D very funny
that conical dynamic permeated the show really, and you see the record of it in a lot of other interactions too, including that of the other witch and the king.

* there are quite a few funny Elaina faces that really should be made into comment faces too

* there is a fair bit of abbreviation in this episode's adaptation, for example the experimentation of the ""lie telling"" and the ""writing"", which made this looked a little more arbitrary than well thought out. For example, no doubt everyone figured out that the magic only can force the individuals to not lie based on their own awareness and perception - there is no way to discern genuine truths of the person didn't know. For example one can't just choose to write the answer to ""what's the meaning of life"" and get the ""42"" :) and that the writing also doesn't allow untruths to be written, but once they are written, the paper can be kept or rearranged (they can't be altered on the paper). E.g. your can bake fresh bread and write the bread is fresh, but keep the paper to put in front of the stale bread tomorrow.

> Now my main ""insight"" is that, this was written and presented like a parable, she's included all the exaggeration and over simplification to boot. Which is why you would think the people are stupid there.

> Much like when you are reading Snow White you don't question stranger danger awareness of the longer girl in front of 7 burly male dwarves, how right it is for the prince to kiss the unconscious girl, etc. Just take it in with that mindset, and I think you'd find the show less annoying/disappointing.

Last comment of the day goes to /u/zadcap for pointing out a possibly ranking system for witches. 

> Today on Witch Talk, I'm again going to take a look at their badges. We're back in a situation where I don't know exactly what they signify, but the way the three witches seen today have a different color and number of beads hanging from theirs makes me believe that even fully accredited Witches have a ranking system. I'll also note that even bereft of magic, witch number three today kept wearing hers, which makes the princess from a few episodes back even more suspicious as not actually being a witch, just a powerful magic user.

Today's Illustrations: [Arc 1 End!](https://imgur.com/a/laSH4s0)

~~Today's Clow Card:~~ None left!

&nbsp;

Question of the Day:

What did you think of the final judgement?

&nbsp;

Comments of the Day:

/u/pankatepankeki [did a marvelous roundup of some of the foreshadowing for yesterday's twist](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11o3pa3/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_45/jbqu6cc/), including:

>Tsukishiro Yukito (月城 雪兎) Yue (月) means the moon in Chinese. Tsukishiro (月城) means moon castle, and Yukito (雪兎) contains the kanji for rabbit (兎 normally read as usagi on its own). For those unfamiliar, in many east Asian cultures, there is thought to be a rabbit on the moon. Fun fact, in Chinese culture, the rabbit is making an elixir of life, whereas in Japanese culture, it's making mochi. The names of CLAMP characters often have important meanings.

/u/Shimmering-Sky [proved that Pokemon logic genuinely works in this series](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11o3pa3/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_45/jbqju2c/):

>Oh, are plant-based cards going to be the answer? Grass does beat Rock in Pokémon…

&nbsp;

On an important note, no unmarked spoilers! No jokes about events yet to come, and no references to future episodes!

**Reminder that there will be another inter-seasonal break tomorrow and on the 13th, with an end of arc discussion thread tomorrow.**

**Clow Card Fortune Book**

**Today's card:**

**[THE LIBRA](https://imgur.com/a/0snOlL4)**

Life, action, and adjusting the balance of ideas.

**Playing Card when Substituted:** 5 of Diamonds

**Card’s Message:**

Using calm, fair judgment, it is possible to start choosing humble decisions. In addition, the matter that caused a loss in balance will return to the best state.

**Card’s Warning:**

However, the best state cannot be obtained if you compare lies to the past. If you reflect, you can gradually restore your balance.

314,Bocchi the Rock vs K-On!,11otabc,"Okay, I have 5 criteria to decide which of these anime reigns supreme. Know that I'm going by what I believe is the best actuality wise.

1. **Characters:** Ok so for Bocchi we have Hitori Gotou as the main star. Her personality is more distinct as a socially awkward person that ages from teens to old men can relate to. Nijika is a reserved extrovert who enjoys band playing since she liked seeing them during youth. Not to mention some past family issues brought her and her sister more together. Ryo is a cool introvert for comedy relief, and Kita is the extrovert who wants to be best friends with Hitori! Why? Not love, because Kita is inspired by Hitori as a guitar player, hell all the girls are inspired by her. It's a well rounded cast of characters with interesting dynamics. Now for K-On, we have Yui as the main character, who likes guitar because ""*gitta!""* She needed a high school activity to join and found the band. She's cute and often has her sister Ui sharing the spotlight. Rio is a shy introvert, but is actually badass at playing and is an inspiration to those around her. Heck her fail at the concert one time brought her more favorability among fans. Ritsu is the extrovert who compliments Rio, always backing her up when she's held back by her goals, and the both are a good combo. Mugi makes the snacks and cleans up after everyone's messes. But she has chip eyebrows that Yui once dreamt about eating. And of course there's Azusa, who has actual goals of playing in a band and has to consistently remind the group about being serious.

Now when you need a 5th character to round things out, and actually makes the show more funny at times, it can work. But 4 in a main cast working together by itself is enough to secure Bocchi the win here.

2. **Settings:** Bocchi takes places in numerous settings, such as the beach, streets of Tokyo, numerous concert settings, etc. That street where Hitori and Hiroi played was so ground to earth, it brought the atmosphere of the music to life, honestly better than a school stage. When you can turn a side street to a stage, it brings about a new level of music and epic-ness. I mean there's also the Starry club where the concerts take place, and it's just raw levels of musical magic happening. Love love love it! K-On does its best with what it has, school, beach, etc. The school concerts are always banging and popular, and that Romeo and Juliet play during the school festival was a nice add, even though it didn't had much to do with the music, but it's still cool to have that episode lol it was funny.

Both have cool settings which incorporate the musical elements greatly, but Bocchi edges out here with more diverse settings. 

3. **Music:** The first album from Bocchi already sold soooo well! Seisyun complex, Distortion!! If I could be a Constellation, all good hits. The studio sounding music that takes you on a whirlwind for a rocket ride, then back down to earth to remind you this is an anime we're watching is a blast. You forget the characters are even singing it lol. K-On..... I'm already gonna say is far superior. Let me tell you why, K-On's music is engraved into the anime. It relays the themes of the anime so well. Run out of ideas? Fue Pen Ball Pen. Yui's grateful for UI? U&I! Goodbye forever song to Azusa? Tenshi Ni Fureta Yo! To me, this is what writing music is about, relating to themes and having heart and soul into it. Bocchi has this too, some of the songs relate to the characters' thoughts and feelings, but K-On just does this relativity on a level that gives it my vote here. Also, I can't listen to K-On's music without watching the show, which reminds me the music is K-On's, Bocchi's music I can easily mistake for any J-Pop song. Lol no disrespect there but it's my thoughts. 

4. **Memorability:** Now this may be a shocker. Of course the idea would be that if you've seen an anime recently you'd remember it. (I can imagine people being like ""*no that's wrong!""* ***nah it's right.***) I can remember all the Kita and Bocchi moments, Bocchi's mental breakdowns, Ryo comedy moments, her giving Bocchi her nickname, etc. All good moments. For K-On, I can remember Yui coaxing Mugi for the guitar, the school festival, concerts, the sleepover at school, the school trips, the time Mugi tried to be bad and steal the cherry to get smacked by Ritsu, etc. All in all these are good moments for both of the series, but ironically K-on still remains on my mind. It could be that Bocchi was battling others for supreme like Chainsaw man and Bleach, but as two shows itself K-On remains the more memorable one. Sometimes simplicity trumps the superior plot. 

5. **Plot:** Speaking of plot, let's compare the two. To start, both center around high school bands forming to make dreams come true. What dreams are.... well that's where the divergence comes. In K-On we had Yui wanting to join to kill time, and so did the other 3. Azusa generally enjoyed rock music, seeing it as a child, and she wants to improve the other 4 to take the music seriously. K-On's plot throughout the show was a simple high school journey through the years. Like a simple slice of life show. It feels as if the girls past high school will remember the rock music, but not follow it as a career, more like a hobby. (here come the K-On stans, ""***It's not supposed to be taken seriously! It's supposed to be simple! You're missing the point!***"") yadda yadda shut up it's my ranking! /s lol K-On is doing what it does, that's alright, nothing wrong with that 7.8/10 MAL score magic. Now for Bocchi, simply stated, every character had their goal in mind with rock music, it was fully fleshed out. One comparison for this is enough: Bocchi finding rock music to overcome her anxiety and actually play rock music as a hobby and even future endeavors vs. Yui wanting to just have fun. Both good plot stories, but Bocchi takes it leagues farther. I'm giving this round to Bocchi.

So to conclude, Bocchi scored in character and settings, while K-On scored in Music and Memorability. The last category was the true meat and potatoes for any show, and ultimately, in a close nail-biter, Bocchi the rock eked out the win.

**Winner: Bocchi the Rock**

315,Is there actually any mecha anime that has no plot and doesn't focus on characters?,11ot9ic,"Just asking, i have seen here and other places people just really not liking or caring for mechas at all, which is fair, not everyone likes giant metal weapons, but then have Evangelion, Code Geass, TTGL and now Gundam Witch as exceptions and sometimes they say those are different because they have plot, focus on characters or something like that and it's just...what?

What kind of shows did people watch?

Do...do people just think that for decades every show will just be a generic bad guy sending monsters of the week and the fight being all there is to an episode until a robot unleashes their finisher?

Are there some shows like that, yes, Voltron was adapted frt exactly go on to be classics and beloved unless they had something more for them, like actual character development going on.

Also, do people just think characters are mute in most shows and nothing really happens...wouldn't that be boring and kinda weird for an entire genre to do for decades, of course there are plots and things change and move as episodes go by!

Oh, and do they show mechas in action scenes...yes, if it's an action show and the mechas are the main weapons the heroes use, do they do cool stuff...well, yeah, no one complains as much when characters do the same with swords or superpowers but with mechas it seems much worse to people for some reason!

And quite a few shows do have the main characters getting in real danger, close to dying and having actual rivals and problems after the first few episodes if not from the start, because some people seem to think everyone gets a super duper robot that makes it so that there is no skill involved and they are never in danger, again, ignoring how boring that would be if every show with mechas was like that.

It's even worse because the studios that made the exceptions and their creators even state that their shows aren't unique and had a lot of inspirations from past mecha series that are just completely ignored.

Anno outright states series from the 70's and 80's like Gundam, Mazinger or Zambot 3 heavily influenced Evangelion and were depressing or focused heavily on their characters and issues too, but apparently that wasn't the case and they were just really simple stories...even TTGL, people liked the over the top action and character moments, and thus...didn't look anywhere else, not even main inspirations like the Getter Robo manga where a bunch of people use physic defying robots powered by green energy that represent determination and eventually face aliens wanting to wipe that tech out for the good of the universe including examples like Getters getting so big that combining would destroy planets and release beams larger than planets...yeah, Gainax didn't even pretend they weren't basically making a crazier version of the Getter Robo manga, only Simon isn't a karate master that casually goes punch the headquarters of the yakuza, gets stabbed in the heart by a katana and then breaks the sword, ignores the wound and keeps punching more yakuza.",Square_Abalone_4484,39,18,0.69

330,[Rewatch] Golden Time Rewatch Interest Thread 2,11omwbd,"I just wanted to post another one just so anyone else who is interested can join in as well! If you have already showed interest, I will tag you in the schedule thread!

Golden time is an amazing romance anime that is coming up on 10 whole years soon, and it is written by the same person who did ToraDora!

By MAL rewrite:

Due to a tragic accident, Banri Tada is struck with amnesia, dissolving the memories of his hometown and past. However, after befriending Mitsuo Yanagisawa, he decides to move on and begin a new life at law school in Tokyo. But just as he is beginning to adjust to his college life, the beautiful Kouko Kaga dramatically barges into Banri's life, and their chance meeting marks the beginning of an unforgettable year. 

After having a glimpse of college life, Banri learns that he is in a new place and a new world—a place where he can be reborn, have new friends, fall in love, make mistakes, and grow. And as he begins to discover who he was, the path he has chosen leads him towards a blindingly bright life that he will never want to forget

I want to do a rewatch on r/anime if enough people are interested.

It is one of my favorite shows of all time, so I hope others can enjoy it as well! https://imgur.com/a/pjXFgfE",One-Imagination2301,5,22,0.78

Any detail you wish to share that's not within the current / past episodes have to be [spoiler tagged](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/q28ulr/announcing_changes_to_spoiler_tags/) which includes details from the manga. Do include the context of the spoilers within the parenthesis:

In the beginning, I thought that 5 Centimeters Per Second (2007) was all style and no substance. It's a little over an hour long and, it failed to capture me with its message despite having three distinct chapters. Although I resonated with the theme a lot at the time, I just didn't click with it like I'd hoped...

...And then I rewatched it again. And again. And again. And again. I've seen it maybe 5 times now. I can't believe I didn't click with it immediately. It isn't just stylistically beautiful, but the way that certain decisions are portrayed with framing alone, and how the characters communicate with the audience primarily through narration, and EVERYTHING from the voice acting to the writing to the look to the music. I've come to realize that it's perfect in every way, and then some. Went from 6 to 10/10 for me.",bitchyswiftie,46,11,0.7

337,Any isekai anime that has the MC end up in the same general world but different?,11odjp8,"Something like that one Naruto movie where they get transported to a place where its still Konoha, the world is still naruto esque, but everything is different. 

Like that, but the whole story is focused on that aspect. Like an MC trying to navigate around a new world that is similar to their own yet substantial things are different enough 

A show where multiple versions like the haruhi spin-off, or FMA to Fmab doesn't count 

I guess Fate Kaleid kinda counts, but the way it was handled there made it like a surprise reveal later instead of us knowing right away",zackphoenix123,31,1,0.53

341,"Back in January 2022, I made a massive post where I ranked & reviewed the first 10 anime series that I ever watched in full. I have now seen 10 more series, and I’d be delighted to talk to anyone here about ANY of these shows. Let’s discuss some anime! (part one)",11o6qog,"# Introduction:

If you’re wondering why it took me so damn long to watch only 10 more shows… There are a couple reasons for that. Chief among them being the fact that I wasn't JUST watching anime for all that time. I still watch a lot more “western animation” than I do anime, and I’ve even started branching out into live action series as of late which usually have a pretty hard time piquing my interest. I am a lover of animation above all else after all. Amazing animation can come from absolutely anywhere. Both America & Japan have created some genuinely life changing animated stories for me. People who ignore either side are SERIOUSLY missing out.

There is another big reason why it took me so many months to finally get this post out, but I think it’d make more sense to go over all of that in the conclusion. For now, let's get into the actual content of the post.

I will first be going over my thoughts on each of these shows individually, in the order that I watched them. Then at the end of the post, I will provide some final thoughts & rank every single one of them. And please remember the following: The **biggest reason** why I’m making this post at all is so that I can talk about all of these shows with as many of you as possible. So ***please,*** if you want to share your thoughts on any of these shows, and/or give me your opinions on MY opinions, I implore you to do so in the comments below. I’m all ears. And for the record, I don’t expect anyone to read every single one of these reviews. Just look around for the shows you care about.

This is part ⅓ by the way. My reviews all together ended up being far longer than reddit would allow in one post, so I will instead be releasing this in the form of 3 separate post. I initially wanted to post all 3 parts at the same time in order to have it all available at once, but the mods wouldn’t allow that, so instead, I'll be releasing Part One right now, and the next 2 parts in the following days. I **HATE** that I have to put it out this way, but it seems to be my best option unfortunately.

Also, here’s the link to my original “First 10” post from last year: [https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/s09ojg/after\_having\_first\_gotten\_into\_anime\_back\_in\_2019/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/s09ojg/after_having_first_gotten_into_anime_back_in_2019/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) It’s comments have long since been disabled, but I did go back to it recently & update a bunch of my thoughts there in preparation for this new post. If anyone is still interested in talking about those shows, I will **GLADLY** discuss them right here. That post includes my views on One Punch Man, Erased, Violet Evergarden, Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day, Little Witch Academia, The Promised Neverland, Sound! Euphonium, Orange, K-On, & Demon Slayer.

But now, let’s finally start talking about some anime!

# Usagi Drop:

This anime is one of THEE most wholesome pieces of media that I have ever experienced. Above all else, this series was just so amazingly delightful & adorable.

The first 5 or so episodes were definitely my favourites of the bunch. There were just SO MANY moments throughout those early episodes that had me smiling uncontrollably. I was so overwhelmingly emotional during certain parts of these episodes that I almost cried of sheer happiness. Tears of joy are a very very rare thing for me, but this show came INCREDIBLY close to drawing them.

It’s not like the show takes a nosedive in quality after episode 5, it’s just that the show becomes slightly more somber in tone after that point. It may not be as infectiously happy as it once was, but it still remains very interesting & engaging. Those occasional scenes of Rin reminiscing about or mourning for her Grandpa were always really good. Very subtle in their emotional maturity.

The episode where Daikichi’s cousin stays over for a while was also quite interesting. It had some super compelling discussions of divorce, married life, parenthood, and it all felt very mature & adult. Not in the edgy sort of way that people so commonly associate with “mature & adult”, but in the REAL way. Such well written dialogue in that episode. Kouki & his mother Yukari were also very welcome additions to the cast. Rin & Kouki had a super cute dynamic, and Yukari & Daikichi had an even CUTER dynamic. I totally ship them.

This anime honestly has far more side characters than I have ample time to talk about, but I legitimately liked every single one of them. All of these characters, even the ones with barely any screen time, added something to the show. None of them were annoying, and they all felt important to some degree.

One more side character that I’d like to specifically highlight though is Rin’s very interesting absentee mother. She’s a rather complicated & tragic character that you can very easily feel both sympathy & resentment for, but one of my biggest problems with the show is that her whole storyline felt kinda unresolved. I don’t feel like we got any real closure for her. Continuing along that train of thought for a moment, the whole show felt kind of unresolved & like it ended super abruptly. The last episode here was just a series of very typical Usagi Drop events with a decent little monologue about parenthood at the end for some added emotional weight, and then boom… it was all over… and it felt sorta incomplete.

I guess I just feel like there’s a lot more that they could have done with these characters in order to make the overall story feel more well rounded. But then again, given what I have since learned about the Manga’s ending… maybe it’s for the best that they didn’t go any further with it. Leaving this version of the story as something unambiguously sweet, instead of letting it become something genuinely fucked up & awful.

Back to positives though, the 2 MAIN characters of this show are both lovely. Daikichi’s journey of learning how to become a good parent was so wonderful to watch unfold, and Rin is pretty easily the most adorable character in any of the anime that I’ve seen so far. Beating out the likes of Taylor Bartlett and even **ALL** of the Keions. Seeing her learn things in school & learn about life while also trying to process the unique situation she exists in was extremely compelling to watch while still always remaining pleasant. Loved both characters

One final thing I’d like to mention is the stellar animation on display here. The character designs were all super appealing, the movement always felt very fluid, and I loved the kinda watercolour aesthetic of it all. Really beautiful stuff.

All in all, Usagi Drop was a pretty good show. It executes everything that it sets out to do extremely well; being more than capable of pulling off both excellent comedic moments & sobering emotional moments. This show had the potential to be something truly amazing if it had gone further with it’s story (in a direction away from the manga), but as is, it’s still really nice. I’m glad I watched it.

# A Place Further Than The Universe:

**WOW.** This show was so much better than I was expecting it to be. Not only is this one of my new favourite anime, it’s one of my new favourite TV shows PERIOD. It’s so damn amazing. Where do I even begin?

I think I’ll start by talking about something I initially considered to be a problem, but that I now consider to be one of the show’s greatest strengths: It’s pacing & structure. By the time I had reached the show’s half-way point, I was starting to feel kinda ripped off by the fact that they weren’t in Antarctica. Even though I was really enjoying the show so far, it felt like I wasn't really getting what was promised

As the anime came to a close however, their time spent on the continent in those last 5 episodes felt absolutely pitch perfect. I now have a great sense of appreciation for how detailed all the build up in this show was. They go **SUPER** deep into the logistics of what it would actually take for 4 random high schoolers to legally get to Antarctica. Them finally finally arriving on the continent in episode 9 only felt so good BECAUSE of all the meticulous build up & the hard work that it took for them to get there. I realize that now.

And they also spend the exact right amount of time in Antarctica once they're there. After their arrival in episode 9, the remaining four episodes are all dedicated to completing the arcs of each of the main 4. One episode each. Yuzuki. Hinata. Shirase. Kimari. I’ll get into what those arcs actually are later on.

Another thing that’s basically perfect about this show is all of it’s production values. The character designs & general visual style were both great, the visual comedy was always on point, and the backgrounds are potentially the best I’ve ever seen in an anime. Like Violet Evergarden level shit. The music here was also pretty excellent. The OP & ED were both wonderful, the score was consistently beautiful, and they wrote so many stellarly emotional songs to underscore these episode climaxes. The fact that this stuff isn't available to stream is probably a war crime.

What caught me most off guard about this anime was how insanely effective all the emotional moments were. I really didn’t expect there to be so many, but they only got more & more powerful as the show went along.

Kimari’s conflicted farewell to Megu was a real heavy hitter, and Shirase defying Hinata by demanding they all fly together was quite beautiful as well, but the scene that stands out as far more darkly emotional than the rest is the one where a certain character utters the words *“It’s beautiful. It’s so very beautiful”.* Hearing those words in such an unfathomably tragic context absolutely ***shook me to my core*** & made me more than a little teary eyed.

The 2 most significant emotional moments for me would have to be the climaxes of both episodes 11 & 12. The other 3 girls all together standing up to Hinata’s shallow old friends in EP11 was without question THEE most emotionally resonant “power of friendship” moment that I have ever seen in anything. That part got some definite tears of joy outta me, but it was nothing compared to “The Email Scene” in EP12. This scene made me absolutely **SOB.** I seriously haven’t cried this hard at a work of fiction since The Violet Evergarden Movie, and Violet is my favourite anime of all time so that is saying A LOT. An absolutely spectacular moment for Shirase’s character.

Let’s get into some of the specific characters now, starting with Kimari. I guess she’s technically my least favourite of the main 4, but I obviously still like her a lot. She felt a little too generic for my tastes earlier on, but she very much came into her own as the anime went on. She probably has the least impactful character arc out of anyone in the main 4, but she works wonderfully as the glue that holds everyone together, and she has her fair share of really funny moments as well. She wanted to do something significant with her youth, and she achieved that goal. I love that for her, but I simply didn’t find her plotline to be nearly as compelling as the arcs of the other 3. Still a very good character though. ***(i rewatched this show recently, and my opinions on her character specifically have changed immensely. i’ll get into that at the end)***

Yuzuki was a pretty great character as well. I really enjoyed seeing her come out of her more reserved & pessimistic shell to become someone who’s a lot more engaged & energetic. Her arc was pretty simple all things considered, but it was still extremely satisfying to watch unfold. Witnessing this sheltered rich kid learn the meaning of true friendship with the help of those around her was just so damn wholesome & emotionally fulfilling.

Hinata proved to be a far more interesting character than she initially lets on. Her central trait of not wanting to inconvenience people under any circumstances was really compelling stuff. Hating the feeling of people being considerate of you is an incredibly unique internal conflict that I don't think I’ve ever seen explored before. At least not with such focus. Specifically her & Shirase coming to understand each other better was really great to see, and like I said before, that confrontation with her old friends was an utterly perfect scene.

And then you have Shirase who is without a doubt the heart & soul of this show. I love basically everything about her. The dichotomy of how reserved she usually is compared to how insanely fired up she's capable of getting was always very entertaining to watch. The way she comes to appreciate her new friends more & more as the show goes along was really sweet, her immense determination in getting to Antarctica was incredibly infectious, and her overall arc of eventually coming to accept her mother’s death was heartbreakingly perfect. Let me reiterate that “The Email Scene” is one of the best things I've ever seen in animation. This show has a truly amazing central cast.

There were some really good side characters here as well. Kanae & Yumiko were both very consistently funny, Gin had an incredibly interesting dynamic with Shirase given their shared history surrounding Takako, and as I alluded to before, Megu was an very unexpectedly compelling character. At first, I kinda thought she was just gonna be a “Nodoka from K-On” type character. A generically smart, down to earth, & reliable character who creates a balanced dynamic with their comparatively air-headed best friend. But her SEVERE reaction to Kimari showing a new sense of determination & independence flipped that dynamic completely on it’s head. In reality, Megu is an incredibly insecure & even petty girl who evidently relied on Kimari WAY more than Kimari ever relied on her. It all makes for a really neat trope subversion, and having the show’s final scene be about the change that Kimari spurred in her, and showing her decision to take a journey of her own The Arctic North was such a PERFECT ending.

So overall, A Place Further Than The Universe was **absolutely stellar.** I loved basically everything about it, and I can’t think of a single significant problem worth mentioning. Part of me really wants to give it a 10/10, but I’ll need to wait & see how well it sticks with me in order to make a judgement like that.

Also, this may be a weird thing to bring up in the midst of the review, but I’m having a really hard time figuring out exactly where I should place this in my anime rankings. Violet Evergarden & Erased are still the Top 2 and I don’t expect that to change any time soon, but I’ve been debating for a while now whether or not I should put this show above my current 3rd place, K-On. Universe is easily the “better” show, but I think K-On might mean more to me personally. At least in the sense that it would make for a much better comfort watch, as well as the fact that K-On is over 3 times as long as Universe, so I feel far more connected to it’s characters through sheer exposure.

Also also, there’s the fact that K-On taps into my love of music far more potently than Universe does. I absolutely love animation, but when it comes to my favourite things in all of existence, it still can’t top how much I love the artistic medium that is Music. And *obviously,* K-On is far more musically driven than Universe. So yeah… I’ve been going back & forth on this for well over a week now, and yet, I still can’t decide. But I guess you’ll all see the verdict at the end of this post.

**HERE ARE SOME NEW, VERY SIGNIFICANT THOUGHTS AFTER REWATCHING THE SHOW AROUND 7 MONTH LATER:**

My second viewing of this show was a legitimately life affirming experience. My first viewing was also incredibly emotionally moving, but that’s only because it’s an extremely well done show. None of that emotion came from anything “personal” that I found relatable within it. The anime was just really good at being a tear jerker. But a number of things relating to my personal mind set & current stage in life have changed significantly since my first viewing of this show. Things that I completely forgot this anime touches on powerfully. Themes that **REALLY** struck me upon hearing them again with a new perspective during what I thought was just gonna be a fun rewatch. I never would have expected to see myself so vividly in an anime that previously had NONE of that kind of affect on me.

In those intermediate months between both viewings, I came to the realization that part of me really hates the place I live. This has absolutely nothing to do with the place itself. It’s an objectively beautiful place with a view that some would kill for, and I’ve always been very well provided for & comfortable here. The problem is in the simple fact that I've been here for literally my entire life, and if I don’t get away from it at some point, I’m never going to feel like my life is moving forward. If I’m here for too long, it’s going to become suffocating. It already is to some degree if I’m being perfectly honest.

Months later, I am newly confronted with the character of Tamaki Mari. A girl who came to some realizations that were very similar to many of mine. Proclaiming in EP2 that the change of scenery makes her feel as if her stagnant life is finally in motion. Her youth in motion. Hearing what were basically my very own thoughts being thrown back at me by this fictional character who was actually to DO something about that stagnation we both share gave me what I can only describe as a “motivational existential crisis”.

Immense regret at the fact that I went so long without doing anything to help throw my stagnant life into motion, but hope in the fact that this will actually soon be changing. I’m going overseas for college this upcoming April. It was a decision I made months before this rewatch, but my 2nd experience with “A Place Further Than The Universe” has made it abundantly clear to me that this trip isn’t just a cool thing I’m doing, ***it’s something I desperately need.*** This trip isn’t just getting part of my education in an unconventional place, it’s a wake up call.

So… needless to say that I’ve completely gotten over my K-On conflict from a few months ago. Not only would I easily put this show above K-On, I’d even put it above Erased now after how much that 2nd viewing affected me. A new show in the silver metal position. I sincerely doubt that anything will ever top Violet Evergarden in my books, but A Place Further Than The Universe is the closest that any other anime has come thus far. What a masterpiece.

# Komi Can’t Communicate:

*(FYI: most of this review is just about S1A because that’s all that was out when I first wrote this, but I did add in some S1B at the end).*

This was a bit of an odd show for me in all honesty. I definitely have overall positive feelings on it, but there were also certain elements here that I really really hated. But let’s get into some positives first of all.

I quite enjoy this show’s very laid back & micro-episodic structure. Most episodes here don’t have a definitive arc within them. They’re all just a collection of “missions” that tell relatively separate short-stories most of the time. It gives the show a lot of variety & keeps it from ever being boring. If you’re finding one of the missions to be kinda boring, chances are that the next one will probably get you engaged again.

Even though this show does have some very distracting flaws that I will get into later, the one thing that always made this show 100% worth watching is the fact that Komi herself is a truly wonderful character. A big reason as to why I enjoy her so much is my ever present fixation on mute or mostly mute characters. If a character doesn’t talk, it’s pretty much impossible to make them annoying. So even when Komi is in the midst of a boring scenario and/or surrounded by annoying characters, her timid charm & our desire to see her reactions to everything always give scenes with her something to latch onto. A tether to genuine quality in this show’s occasional shitty-ness.

Her inherent unobtrusiveness was far from the only reason I loved her so much though. The internal & external struggles that she constantly faces in trying to communicate with others was always very compelling to watch. While CERTAINLY not to the same level of inconvenient intensity, I too suffer with ever present social anxiety, and thus, I found quite a lot of relatability in Komi’s character. She’s such an enjoyable central character.

If I were to sum up most of my problems with this anime in the form of one quick phrase, it would come down to the fact that it’s just “a bit much” at times. A lot of the super “in-your-face” jokes don’t really work, some of the hyper-tropey side characters are absolutely obnoxious, and the ravenous obsession that the entire student body has with Komi is a bit that became unfunny & hard to take seriously almost immediately.

The show’s humour is a pretty mixed bag overall. The comedy directly involving Komi’s social anxiety was always pretty great, and there were numerous other hilarious moments derived from other characters… but unfortunately, there’s a rather large amount of cringe here as well. To get into the specifics of what is & isn’t funny in this series, I’ll need to start breaking down this show’s absolutely massive supporting cast. So let’s do that.

Tadano is definitely a character that exists. Despite technically being the show’s protagonist, he seriously has nothing going for him. This dude genuinely doesn’t have a character beyond his enjoyable dynamics with Komi & Najimi. I can’t say he’s a bad character. There’s nothing actively annoying about him. He just… exists I guess?

I **LOVE** Najimi though. They embody pretty much EVERYTHING that I could ever wish to be. Personable, funny, optimistic, genderless, kind of a gremlin but in a way that’s endearing. The whole package. They help complete/balance out the show’s main trio perfectly. Mute, Charisma, & Cardboard makes for a surprisingly fun central dynamic here. Najimi would definitely be my 2nd favourite character in the show. Just after Komi.

Yamai was an interesting case. Being a textbook yandere, I found her character & mere presence in the narrative to be kinda off putting at first. Especially when she kidnapped & literally almost killed Tadano, and was then so easily forgiven for her EXTREMELY illegal actions. In spite of the flimsy introduction, her antics actually became much funnier as the show(‘s first half) went along. Her proposal shouted from the rooftop was especially hilarious. She was pretty fun overall.

I ***vehemently*** Agari though. Her consistent idiocy is extremely annoying, and her constant desperation is truly disturbing. She seemed fine enough during her initial introduction, but it only gets worse from there. **Incomprehensibly worse.** Every single one of the most horrifically terrible jokes in the show are centred around her massive chest or insistence on being a dog. Such a horrible character. Why the hell did they think she was a good idea?

Nakanaka was quite enjoyable though. I really appreciate when an unabashedly nerdy character is simply portrayed as misunderstood instead of a total loser, and the fact that she connects with Komi so easily due to Komi having never had enough social brain rot to judge her weirdness was so damn wholesome. Very excited to see more of her in later episodes.

Onemine only showed up in the last few episodes (of S1A), but I already absolutely love her. Having such a down to earth character like this in the midst of everyone else’s insanity is such a refreshing thing to see. She’s just so fundamentally likeable. I also really love her infrequent companion, Kadae. I read somewhere that the original manga often depicts Onemine holding Kadae’s hand in order to keep her from randomly disappearing as she tends to do. That is so powerfully wholesome that I’m starting to realize I kinda ship them. Regardless of their actual relationship status, what they have is adorable, and I can’t wait to see more of it.

Komi’s entire family was another big highlight in the side cast. The dynamic of having 3 basically mute people + 1 non-stop chatterbox was pretty amazing, but I especially loved any interactions between Komi’s & her Dad. Those scenes were always unbelievably wholesome. There are more side characters that I didn’t talk about simply due to how forgettable they are, but this anime still has a mostly very solid set of characters. There are bad ones, but the good very much outweighs the bad.

Another thing that I kinda hated about this anime was it’s frequent inability to let almost ANY of it’s tender moments just… be as they are. Specifically in regards to the romantic tension between Komi & Tadano.

Maybe I’ve just spoiled myself with too much genuine emotional maturity in my earliest anime selections, but it really pissed me off whenever Tadano & Komi would have a cute and/or lightly romantic scene together… and then Tadano would literally just scream at the perceived awkwardness of the situation.

That always sucked. It’s not funny. It’s just incredibly annoying & uninteresting. I don’t even hold this against Tadano’s character. I hold it against the writers who seem afraid to actually delve into the emotions of their characters. I’m not saying Tadano shouldn’t be flustered in these situations, that is COMPLETELY natural. It’s just the super exaggerated nature of his reactions that really bug me.

And there’s one more thing that I need to rant about before I wrap up my thoughts on this anime. Other than EP1 which (due to that amazing chalk-board scene) is easily the best episode here, I consider this show’s best & worst episode to be one in the same… EP7

The first half was a full on pool episode, and it was… an experience. I’ve been very specific about avoiding anything pervy in my anime journey so far. That shit really irks me, but this episode completely blindsided me with it because I had absolutely no way of seeing it coming. There I was… suffering through gratuitous fan-service & several unfunny innuendos at the hands of a show that had previously earned my trust. All whilst wondering why the **HELL** I’m even watching this show when it’s making me so incredibly uncomfortable. Even the occasionally decent character work at that location couldn’t save it from being an insufferable viewing experience.

But then for some ***unfathomable*** reason, the second half of EP7 contains some of **THEE** most wholesome things that I have ever seen in animation. Komi bonding with her Dad over shaved ice, Komi trying to cheer up some random baby because she accidentally startled it, and then on the way home stopping to play at a playground. Seeing this highschooler take genuine delight in the simple joys of a children’s playground is one of the greatest things I’ve ever seen. I simply could not stop smiling from ear to ear throughout all of these wonderful sequences.

So my question is… how in the absolute ***HELL*** did they manage to fit so much **DEGENERATE** & so much **WHOLESOME** into the same fucking episode? Like bruh, the annoying male side characters were literally just grading random women’s bodies not even 10 minutes ago! Why am I now ***legitimately almost crying*** at the sheer heart melting adorableness of this father/daughter relationship? The dichotomy here is truly beyond incomprehensible.

But I digress. Komi Can’t Communicate was a pretty good show overall. It has some definite problems, but I was still genuinely enjoying myself at least 80% of the time.

**SOME DISORGANIZED SEASON 1B THOUGHTS NOW THAT THE WHOLE SEASON IS OUT**

Yamai is *extremely* annoying & insufferable now. Her whole attitude towards Komi has distinctly shifted “Marry Me” to “Fuck Me” in the 2nd half here. She used to be funny, but now she just makes me uncomfortable. I really hope they tone her down for future episodes because I still believe that she has comedic potential.

I’m also not super into Najimi anymore. I loved them SO MUCH early on, but their characterization has become extremely repetitive in this 2nd half, and it really feels like the writers have no idea what they want to do with them. They’ve become kind of annoying honestly, which is really sad to say given how much I once enjoyed them. They desperately need to add some depth to this character moving forward because the core appeal just isn;’t working anymore.

Also EP23 was bizarrely terrible. The vignettes that they chose to show here were beyond confusing to me. They were very unfunny, they didn’t feel even remotely relevant, and the animation was of shockingly poor quality most of the time. It all felt like nothing more than awkwardly rushed filler. Like they were running low on budget or something & didn’t want to skimp on the finale so they instead skimped on the penultimate episode. Also this new OP song kinda sucks. A pathetic replacement for the energetically insane masterpiece that was “Cinderella” from S1A.

The new ED is genuinely amazing though. Not only are these pixel art visuals insanely cool, I am absolutely in love with the song here, “Koshaberibiyori”. “Hikare Inochi” from S1A outro was really nice too, but this song is on another level entirely. It was one of my most played songs of 2022. Loved that shit. I also loved a lot of the new characters in this 2nd half. The sheer juxtaposition between Katai’s super intimidating stature & his extremely timid internal dialogue was super funny, and he has some very enjoyable dynamics with both Komi & Tadano.

I can’t remember his real name at the moment, but I also loved “The Narcissist''. A character like this should be unbearably annoying, but it only works here because his self-importance never negatively affects the other characters. He’s just so completely enraptured with his own perceived greatness, and it’s so delightfully pathetic. That friend of his who’s constantly contradicting him with blatant 4th wall breaks also helped make the character far more enjoyable

Other than Komi who is obviously the most well rounded character in the show, Onemine has now 100% cemented herself as Best Girl. I absolutely loved learning about her family in the Valentines episode. Can’t wait to see more of her.

Episode 21 was genuinely spectacular. Kato & Sasaki were both excellent additions to the cast, and seeing Komi build such a strong bond with them in such a short amount of time was so damn wholesome & really well written. It was so satisfying to see Komi form new friendships without ANY help from Tadano or Naijimi, and having these friends be the catalyst for Komi to finally realize that she’s crushing on Tadano was SO adorable

What I loved most about the 2nd half of this season is the fact that they completely fixed what was previously my single biggest issue with the show. \*They’re actually giving the emotional/tender moments room to breathe now!\* Komi & Tadano have several cute scenes here that AREN’T immediately undercut by a comedic over-reaction, and I am so damn grateful for that. Episode 19 was especially notable in that regard. The specific way in which they actually got Komi to TALK AT LENGTH was ***brilliantly*** staged, and hearing even more stories from her hyper-isolated past was genuinely heartbreaking.

It all makes for a truly great scene & a wonderful moment in this relationship. I’m obviously quite eager for their dynamic to develop into something more than just friends, but I still really like where they ended things off this season. On the whole, I still really like this anime. A few things definitely need work, but the show is working in all of the most important ways now.

# Star Wars: Visions:

Funny story about this show actually. Visions was technically the 8th anime that I ever watched to completion. It definitely should have been included in my original post, but because I saw the show as a STAR WARS project above all else, it never even crossed my mind to include it in the anime post even though that is **exactly** what it was

For those who may be confused by me including a Star Wars show here, let me give some quick context. “Star Wars: Visions” is an anime anthology series. Even though it was in fact commissioned, overseen, & distributed by Disney, the creative process of each individual episode was done entirely by Japanese creators. 7 different anime studios that would ultimately produce nine 12-25 minute short stories set within the Star Wars universe. Shorts that had the freedom to be as wildly creative as they want, due to them not existing as “official canon”. Visions is the anime industry be let loose onto one of the most expansive fictional universes in all of fiction, and the results are pretty damn cool

Due to all 9 episodes of the anime existing as disconnected stories with no significant through-line other than “Being Star Wars”, I’m just gonna talk about each of them individually before giving some brief overall thoughts at the end.

**The Duel:** This was a really great way to introduce the show to everyone. It’s light on plot or meaningful characters to latch onto, but it looks AMAZING. It employs this super unique, hyper-stylized 3D look that evidently takes FAR more inspiration from the live action epics of Akira Kurosawa than it does any piece of Japanese *animation.* And the titular “duel” here is just so damn cool. The umbrella-saber is absolutely absurd, but also so absurdly cool. Very fun episode.

**Tatooine Rhapsody:** This is pretty easily the most widely disliked episode here, and even though I can see why to a certain degree, I really don’t think it’s all that bad. The concept of an Order 66 survivor becoming not a rebel, not a hermit, but in fact the front-man of a rock band that’s shooting for galaxy wide fame is really cool in my opinion. It is a little unengaging & generic in places, but it still delivers an ultimately satisfying story with a dope song at the end. It’s a very unique Star Wars story.

**The Twins:** The action in this episode is absolutely mind blowing & so beautifully ridiculous. There are no laws of physics in this story. Not even basic practicality matters here. Everything in this episode is dictated by “The Rule of Cool”, and it is glorious. Leading to the single most bombastically flashy lightsaber duel in the entire Star Wars saga. The characters & story don’t particularly matter in this one either, but they really don’t need to. This short exists to be a stunning visual spectacle & it pulls that off flawlessly.

**The Village Bride:** This one was genuinely quite beautiful. Not only were the animation & score both drop-dead-gorgeous, but the creators actually managed to weave a decently emotionally compelling story in the short amount of time that they had. I really loved the world of this episode. The culture & feel of this new planet is incredibly well fleshed out in a way that feels both very anime & perfectly Star Wars. I was also very compelled by this mysterious Jedi survivor simply named “F”. I’d LOVE to see more about her in the future. A novel or something would be dope.

**The Ninth Jedi:** EASILY the best episode here, and it’s not even close. Everything about this one had me completely sold. The concept, the action, the characters, the pacing, that amazing plot twist, & the exploration of a never before seen time period in Star Wars. It’s all amazing. I would kill to see this episode expanded into a full series. The director of this episode actually said that he designed it as if it were a pilot, so I pray to God that he gets to expand upon it one day. I am 110% certain that it would make for a spectacular show.

**T0-B1:** This one is basically just “Star Wars Pinocchio”, and it’s perfectly fine. The duel in the climax is really cool, and the electronic score here is actually amazing, but other than those 2 elements, there’s nothing particularly noteworthy here. It’s OK. Moving on.

**The Elder:** Definitely the safest episode of the bunch. Discount Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan receive a distress signal & then fight some creepy old sith dude. The Elder has a cool design, these Jedi are decent enough characters, and the duel at the end is pretty dope. It’s not a favourite, but it’s still decent.

**Lop & Ochô:** This is another episode that had me completely sold, but not in the exact same way as The Ninth Jedi. That episode felt like the fully realized pilot for an entire season of television, but this episode feels more like half a season’s worth of story that’s been crammed into 20 minutes. And even though that does make the pacing & progression here feel a little odd, it all still works as an amazing proof of concept. I love the ideas & characters that they’ve established here, and it’d be so cool to see all of it expanded into an entire anime.

**Akakiri:** I didn’t really like this one honestly. It has a very unique visual style & all, but I just just wasn’t engaged by the story or characters, and the presentation alone wasn't enough to carry the episode. It’s very clearly trying to mirror the fall of Anakin Skywalker, and similarly to how it was portrayed in the prequels, it’s not terribly convincing. I feel very “whatever” on this one. A slightly disappointing way to close out the collection.

**Overall Thoughts:** Even though the quality of these episodes is mixed, and despite the fact that it will not be placing very high in my overall rankings, I still absolutely adore Visions on a fundamental level. Letting a bunch of talented creative groups do whatever the hell they want with Star Wars is such an amazing idea, and I hope this project never stops. I should also mention that after this post, I will not be including Visions in any of my future anime rankings. This is because it’s not exactly going to be an “anime” for very much longer. Volume Two is coming out this May, and all 9 episodes are going to be coming from animation studios all over the world this time around. Ireland, India, Spain, & many others.

The show has gone global, and while I am absolutely delighted to see Star Wars be taken on by an even broader selection of cultural viewpoints, it’s gone beyond anime now. I have absolutely no issue with anyone else having different definitions than me, but for the sake of simplicity, I’ve always just considered “anime” to be any work of animation that originates in Japan. That definition no longer defines Visions in it’s entirety, so it shall be omitted from future lists. It’s a worldwide anthology now, and **I LOVE THAT.**

342,Can anybody recommend me some more Isekai as a relative newcomer to the genre?,11o5yq6,"Since this anime season is a little slow, I decided to catch up on old backlogs and try new genres. One of the genres I tried was isekai and surprisingly I ended up enjoying the genre a lot despite hearing a lot of mixed things about it. So far, I watched Tondemo Skill, Slime, Mushoku Tensei, and most of  The Eminence in Shadow. For the isekai genre, I enjoyed the lightheartedness and how fun it was to watch it but Mushoku Tensei has definitely become one of my favorite animes due to Rudy's growth, the story, and many other factors like the animation or the effort into making the languages.

So far, I'm planning to watch Re:Zero and Made in Abyss (Not sure if this counts as isekai).

Any recommendations would be welcome!",TheLazyWorkingSloth,33,6,0.69

Now is the time to focus on the foundation. What is important are the basics, and to not forget to make an effort. There is no immediate effect, but the results will eventually bring about a big chance to become productive.

Occasionally, a big heart can accept and stop everything. Nothing turns egocentric, and there is
no expected growth.

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

First comment goes to /u/Specs64z 

> The dub this episode is pretty standard, not too much to comment on good or bad. I prefer the nervous wreck girl in sub, but the students have so few lines and d!Elaina is better so I can let that attachment slide. Elaina and Fran’s conversation overlooking the port has a charming back and forth that the dub captures well.

> Water sword boy is living the life, clearly. We should all channel the energy of water sword boy more often.

> After being thrust into the depths of hell, we emerge on the other side to find a much brighter scene. After all the drama, I wouldn’t blame you for questioning why Elaina travels at all, so I think its timing and theming are spot on. Elaina travels because, all in all, it makes her happy.

> I really like how the story opens and closes, with Elaina launching into a nostalgic tale after finding what we can only assume is Fran’s book of her own adventures. Very fun twist that its publication was both a total accident and a cultural phenomenon.

> We also get a taste of some world building in this episode. The brooms being fitted with lanterns is a small detail that is both visually striking and highly practical, cementing the cozy safety offered by this town. The reaction to Elaina from the students reinforces how rare a witch encounter actually is. I think if I were to offer a point of criticism, rooftops would probably tend to be a lot more walkable in a society where personal flying devices are normal rather than the slopes we see for most of them.

> Elaina talks about the flowers withering (naturally, she has no way to care for them as a traveler) as an excuse to leave, but admits at the very end that not wanting the flowers is ultimately an excuse to avoid saying good-bye. Fortunately for her, Fran’s plan was quite fitting for the traveler’s life.

Second comment goes to /u/MasterTotoro

> I like seeing more details about the city we are visiting. In Royal Celesteria it seems like people are either street performers or part of Kiki's Delivery Service. Here it seems there are a lot of magic users with an academy as well, though the most common use of magic still seems to be riding brooms. As a side note, the dancing teddy bear reminds me of yesterday's episode, not sure if that's the intended effect here lol.

> The academy has a mix of both males and females, and they all seem to be somewhat around the same skill level. In Elaina's hometown there seemed to be a lot of witches, but everywhere else seems like they are much rarer than initially shown to be. Aside from witches, the magic level in this world seems relatively low but still substantial enough that we could see some more creative uses.

349,[Rewatch] Golden Time Rewatch Interest Thread,11o0llf,"Golden time is an amazing romance anime that is coming up on 10 whole years soon, and it is written by the same person who did ToraDora!

By MAL rewrite:

Due to a tragic accident, Banri Tada is struck with amnesia, dissolving the memories of his hometown and past. However, after befriending Mitsuo Yanagisawa, he decides to move on and begin a new life at law school in Tokyo. But just as he is beginning to adjust to his college life, the beautiful Kouko Kaga dramatically barges into Banri's life, and their chance meeting marks the beginning of an unforgettable year. 

After having a glimpse of college life, Banri learns that he is in a new place and a new world—a place where he can be reborn, have new friends, fall in love, make mistakes, and grow. And as he begins to discover who he was, the path he has chosen leads him towards a blindingly bright life that he will never want to forget

I want to do a rewatch on r/anime if enough people are interested.

It is one of my favorite shows of all time, so I hope others can enjoy it as well! https://imgur.com/a/pjXFgfE",One-Imagination2301,26,48,0.81
350,Are there no modern romances with actually adult relationships?,11nz9hz,"I’ve been watching anime since I was a teen. I’m 30 now. Used to love romance anime’s but as I’ve grown older I find myself rolling my eyes at mother immaturity on display for these teens and I get it, their young. But some of these newer college/work place romances are sort of the same high school interactions with adults.

I just want actual adults who’ve been in relationships before. Like a guy attempting to flirt with someone at the bar or an internal monologue of a women acknowledging the sexual tension between herself and a co-worker and trying to figure out what to do about it or working thru the possible pitfalls of having to share a great deal of your time with a partner who you don’t really share much in common with.

Ya know actual interactions. Because Al lot of what we get sort of seems like this idealism and while I understand that’s what the anime community loves it feels trite at this point. I think it could be very interesting  and a bit of fresh air to have romances that are a bit closer to reality and you can still ham up the drama in some way",YutaniCasper,154,84,0.71

354,What are some ways to raise awareness for new anime shorts and movies?,11nxjok,"I have noticed that very few people watch more than an anime movie or two. Usually those movies are only from the biggest of franchises. It is a shame when some many good movies come out but seem to largely go unnoticed. How can one keep track of movie releases? What is a good way to spread the word?

&#x200B;

Even worse though is the shorts. If it wasn't for the reddit awards I wouldn't know most of these ever existed. Even if I want to be an informed voter I often find that I barely watch all of the finalist. I imagine it is probably worse for others.

Hey guys, I've been a huge fan of My Hero Academia for a while now, and I've been really enjoying all the different intros that the show has had. However, I've been wondering which one is the best, and I thought it would be great to hear what the community thinks!

Personally, my favorite intro is the first one. I love the energy, the music, and how it introduces all the different characters. It really gets me pumped up for each episode!

But I'm curious, what do you guys think? Do you agree that the first intro is the best, or do you have a different favorite? Let me know in the comments!",Critical_Equipment_7,21,0,0.44

365,What do you think about Blue lock?,11nouad," 

Don't get me wrong, it's a decent show but while it has a few hype moments, it's often predictable, the main character thinks way too much, and it gives too much space to characters I don't really care about (like the entire Bachira thing with Rin and Isagi, the whole time he was talking about monsters I constantly tought ""Yeah okay, but I don't care, can I just see the match please without having to hear 10 minutes of Bachira thinking?"" and when he stops then it's again 30 seconds of match and then Isagi thinking for another 11 minutes).

The last thing that's starting to get annoying is the fact that it's starting to get demential. I undestand that's not an anime to watch if you want to see realistic football but there are some moments in which the characters do things and think about things that don't make any sense. I know it's a different type of show and it's a survival but we're still talking about football (one of the major examples of this is Barou, instead of saing ""I will take the ball"" he says ""I will devour you"" and than the show goes on showing you a lion and than everyone calls him king. This is not cool, this is demential, so much it's starting to making me laugh instead of being hyped).

This show while being decent the more goes on, the less the characters, the story and the dialogue make sense but still it remains very predictable.

That's just my view , don't feel insulted if it's your favourite show. Let me know what you think.",pirro29,50,0,0.46

369,"What's the most recent anime that you would call a ""classic,"" and why?",11nny3z,"""Classic"" feels like a pretty flexible word. Broadly it tends to be something along the lines of, ""Belonging to the highest rank or class,"" but there's also usually a time factor applied to it. Exactly what that is will vary, but it's rare that something will be viewed as a ""classic"" as soon as its released. There's often a sentiment that first it must ""stand the test of time"". So I was wondering how people feel, and how little time something *needs* in order to make the cut by using your most recent anime that you feel makes the cut.

I'd base it on when the anime began, not when its aired most recently, otherwise you'd get awkward cases of anime that have been running for 20+ years, but are still ""recent"".",FetchFrosh,144,56,0.77
370,what were your stereotypes about anime in your pre anime phase?,11nno6t,I think ive said this somewhere but i used to assume that all anime is just young guys screaming in japanese while fighting with those cliche edgy dialogues shit talking about who's power can end the opponent early.,weishenmyguy,82,20,0.73
371,What's that one anime that is from a genre you usually dont like but LOVED a particular one from it?,11nnlde,"For me it was Usagi Drop as a slice of life. But it was really entertaining enough to keep me watching until end, and really became one of my all time favourites and only one i actually enjoyed from slice of life.",weishenmyguy,67,15,0.71
372,The use of the middle finger in anime,11nlty5,"Is it just me or does a character in an anime using an insult feel... off and unnatural? As in it's really exaggerated and not subtle?

I forgot which specific episode features them, but an example of this can be found in Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and Super Crooks

The way middle fingers are portrayed in anime makes it seem like the writer/director was like ""Hey, Japanese portion of this anime's audience! You know this form of visual insult/profanity from America? Well, you can take a look at it very clearly when the character who does it brings his hand right at the camera!""",SuperAlloyBerserker,6,0,0.39

374,My Interpretation on My Favorite SSSS.Dynazenon Scene,11nh0vq,"A couple of weeks ago, I binge-watched SSSS.Gridman and SSSS.Dynazenon. Both of them are great shows and I blame myself for not watching them way earlier (probably because I’m not much of a mecha guy), but Dynazenon in particular quickly became one of my favorite animes of all times. The visual narrative, paced exploration of the show’s characters, natural development of their conflicts and relationships, and overall style and atmosphere caught me immediately; but the point of no return came after reaching the **floodgate scene in Episode 10**. Thus, I want to share my analysis of some of the little details and innuendos this beautiful scene is loaded with. Needless to say, **this read will contain lots of spoilers**, so [those not taking in this warning be damned](https://imgur.com/a/lLTdzek).

The whole scene is basically split into three parts: the one when Yume first arrives to meet her sister at the top of the floodgate, a second one where they hold their conversation, and a final one back in the real world.

After Yomogi breaks into Yume’s dream, they run to the floodgate to stop Kano from committing suicide. When Yume arrives, Kano tells her she’s neither intending to die nor betray Yume’s promise to attend her recital. At this point, we get a couple of quick flashbacks reminding us how Futaba — Kano’s boyfriend — was sure what happened to his girlfriend was indeed an accident, followed by a short shot of [Yume falling from the floodgate back in Episode 9](https://imgur.com/a/5GmiSxn). Back in that episode, Yume accidentally drops the ankh puzzle of her sister and falls to catch it, which suggests **this is the way Kano died**.

Right before Yume arrives at the beginning of the scene, [Kano can be seen holding the very same ankh puzzle in front of her while singing](https://imgur.com/a/Wfl1CAo) — I’m not pretty sure if she was doing this on purpose or it was the show’s way of making the link between this scene and her cause of death more clear, but it makes it pretty safe to assume she dropped her puzzle and fell off the flood gate this way. The close-up on Yume’s face also implies she came to the same realization herself.

After this exchange, the sisters talk to each other a bit and Yume asks Yomogi for a little more time with her sister, to which he agrees and thus the episode follows him helping his other comrades.

When the show comes back to the floodgate, [Yume and Kano are sitting next to each other holding their respective instances of the ankh puzzle, still unsolved](https://imgur.com/a/PbDkXxm) — I understand this as the sisters yet to understand each other entirely; the puzzle would represent their inner selves still dwelling on this.

Kano opens up about why she would regularly come to the floodgate to sing (because she was too embarrassed to do it at home), why she pushed her little sister away (out of jealousy towards her social skills), and how she joined the chorus club to change (and stayed drawn by Futaba’s kindness). I like how the whole episode stays silent *until this scene*; a beautiful piano score kicks in as Yume — and the viewer — begins to understand the thought process behind Kano’s behavior with her when she was a child.

Something that picked my attention here is that, as Yume and Kano lay down talking, they keep [looking away from each other the whole exchange](https://imgur.com/a/ZLDxWmM); this can get a little confusing as the viewer may be drawn to think they’re looking at each other, especially when [the camera closes-up a couple of time on their eyes](https://imgur.com/a/alTiPoI), but paying attention to the full shots before and after makes it clear that Yume is, indeed, to the right of her sister. Overall, I think those close-ups were mostly meant to portray their physical similarities as sisters, although I gave it another interpretation at the beginning that I will mention later on.

Anyways, Kano tries to make sure Yume understands that her boyfriend was a nice person. This is followed by another flashback of Episode 9, this time [a close-up of Futaba’s engagement ring](https://imgur.com/a/k1ZL9Nq), implying Yume was still holding resentment towards him for not “saving” her sister, and probably for moving on with his own life as well, though she accepts Kano’s words with a simple *“okay.”*

Now, this is the part I love the most about this scene: as Yume finally finishes understanding her sister, [she suddenly solves the ankh puzzle she was struggling with the whole show](https://imgur.com/a/HZ1XoAW). This is really evocative to me — ever since she finds this puzzle in Kano’s room, she’s shown trying to solve it over and over again as, from my point of view, a direct analogy to her pursuit of her sister’s past. She kept dwelling on her loss, and for the most part, she wasn’t even entirely sure why. That’s why her solving the puzzle in this scene is so powerful — the puzzle splitting can be read as both getting to terms with the memories of her sister, solving her inner conflict; and finally being able to part ways with Kano to come back to her own life and move on. And right after solving the puzzle, [she looks back at her sister just to realize the dream is over](https://imgur.com/a/KW4SI2R); Yume comes back to the realization Kano’s no longer with her, but this time with a different understanding of how it all happened and her feelings leading to that point, all while presenting the viewer with a shot of her dream **literally breaking down behind her** — a clear, visual way of telling us not only that the dream itself is over, but also her being stuck in the past.

I mentioned above that, in the beginning, I gave a different interpretation to those close-ups of the sisters' eyes looking away from each other. The very first time I watched this scene, I thought Yume and Kano were avoiding each other’s eye contact to prevent the dream from falling apart, mostly because when Yume solves the puzzle, she looks like she stared back at her sister impulsively (almost like if it was by accident), and right after that the dream is “terminated.” However, after watching the scene a second time, it became clear this was not the case, as they actually look into each other’s eyes several times throughout the whole conversation.

After Yume’s dream comes to an end, she thanks Kano for the last time before leaving. Right after that, [Kano stands up and seems to resume her singing](https://imgur.com/a/eiAawgP), which implies to me that she’s going back to her “normal” sequence of events from right before being approached by Yume; that is, accidentally dropping her ankh puzzle and having the accident that would end her life.

The whole fight with the kaiju at hand takes place, and then the show comes back to reality. After Yomogi inquires Gauma about his past a bit (and Chise tries to casually manipulate Koyomi into going for some takoyaki with her), we’re taken to a shot of [Yume standing on an edge the same way her sister was on top of the flood gate, holding the solved puzzle in front of her while singing her sister’s song](https://imgur.com/a/fEFJIoM). She redoes the puzzle back together, which I personally interpret as her closing the cycle with Kano’s memory, or even bridging the relationship with her deceased sister forever.

Now, something I’m not entirely sure about is if this whole exchange between Yume and her sister only represents her reaching a better understanding of what she remembers of Kano exclusively. We’re told throughout the show that kaiju have powers that are unbound from human conventions and understanding, so I believe this episode can be either assumed to have brought back Kano’s conscience for Yume to have her talk with her thanks to the power of kaiju, or just an abstraction of Yume’s reflection on her past. I leave it to each person’s interpretation.

What I am sure about, though, is that the whole episode brings Yume’s past to a beautiful, meaningful closure (albeit still somewhat tragic), and I loved it.

Thanks for reading my thoughts on this scene. I hope we all can keep having a lot of fun with amazing anime deliverance like this when the Gridman Universe movie comes out.

375,What does Jujutsu Kaisen have over Chainsaw Man?,11ncs5d,"I've always been lukewarm on JJK and never really ""got"" the appeal. After falling in love with CSM last fall that proved especially true. The former just seems like a much more unrefined version of the latter, and my suspicions were more than confirmed after watching JJK Zero and being very... whelmed by the experience.

So if someone wants to go to bat for Jujutsu Kaisen, could you explain why people hype the series so much? Is it just ""because its Shounen""? Am I overthinking everything?",Salty145,103,0,0.24
376,Modernization and frequent European culture in Isekai's,11nbzz0,"Am I the only one that dislikes, nay, hates it whenever an isekai world becomes modernized because the MC got transported there? Lots of times it's because the MC uses his modern knowledge and thereby changes the world around him. I'm fine with the MC using this knowledge to ""cheat"" and become OP but only when it's for himself. He doesn't start teaching to the broader world. I love it when the MC gets isekai'd and simply adapts to this new, foreign, harsher world. He starts living like the regular non-isekai denizens with every now and again using the knowledge he has from the modern world. For example, if the MC is able to recreate lets say soap or some other item that we have in the modern world ( not guns ) that makes life more convenient, he would only use it for himself and maybe his close companions. He won't start selling it, or showing people how it's made to not change the world around him too much.

I also hate it when the isekai world has magic and the MC can use magic but for some reason still decides to use modern weapons like guns for combat. Bro what? You literally shoot fireballs from your hands and you still want to use a gun. You high MC? Definitely something I hate about Arifureta.

I dislike all of this because for me it takes away that feeling of being in an isekai. The whole point is to get transported/reincarnated into a whole different world with it's own set of rules and lifestyle. Modernizing it just takes away from that. Besides the elves and beast races, it doesn't feel like the old medieval world. 

Another thing that I'm starting to get tired off is that practically all Isekai take place where the regular human isekai race/country is based off of Medieval Europe. The isekai people would have European, French, Italian esque names, and the general aesthetic of the country and the buildings is the same. I would love if the culture of the human kingdom of the isekai world be more 12th century Mongolian or 7th century Gokturk. Make is something very foreign and different to the usual European medieval fantasy land.",blueswizzles,25,0,0.24

DanMachi has loads of fanservice, but almost all of it falls into the ""neutral"" category, where I wouldn't really care if it was removed.

The scene with Ryu and Bell cuddling by the fire was erotic to an extent, but it was also handled very tastefully and had significance to the characters involved and the plot.

What other shows have fanservice used so well? Kill La Kill immediately comes to mind, as much of the plot revolved around it. Other Ecchi shows like DxD and Dress-Up Darling might also count, but those feel like cheating due to fanservice being a significant focus of the series.

/u/LeonKevlar [detailed just how bad the dub is](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11mb4hn/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_43/jbguwcz/):

>Nelvana Dub Shaoran is a total dick to Meilin. When Meilin asks Shaoran if she was in his way, Nelvana Shaoran bluntly tells Meilin that she is really getting in his way. Nelvana Shaoran also tells Meilin that her going home is no big deal and he can handle the Clow Cards without her.

>Wait... if they're dropping China right before our big climax then... China isn't an anime only character, is she? I demand proof that she exists in the manga right this second!! OMG WTF!?!? She isn't real!? Why!? Why didn't I know about this!? I thought it was strange just how useless she was and how she never seemed to get any real roles in the Clow Card contests but it never occurred to me that she might have not actually existed until now.

>IS CHINA REAL!? I'M GETTING A LOT OF MIXED ANSWERS AND I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST!! I'M STARING AT A WORLD ATLAS AT THE MOMENT AND IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT TO ME!!

>...Im lost... The events of the episode itself didn't phase me half as badly as the suggestion that she may not even exist. China V2 was the woman who could have become like a sister to me. Clamp might not have written her into the plot so they cannot judge me!!

**Questions of the Day, courtesy of u/chilidirigible:**

1) Should the series have emphasized the difficulty and danger of what Walküre was doing more often at the beginning, or even folded in some of this flashback? Would that have made them look less like they were jobbing later on?

2) You think that someone could get away with an anime idol series where they straight-up brainwash people? Would that be too much of a meta-commentary?

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

First comment of the day goes to /u/dsawchuk for their analysis on the city.

> The city that Mirarose lives in is interesting. It's pretty cold there (unclear how seasonal this is) and the city looks vaguely like a snowflake from above. It appears to be built over a lake, but the steep cliffsides all around the lake make it seem manmade. As though the stone for creating the city was quarried from directly around it to create a large moat. It has a large wall, with 6 defensible bridges over the water. This city looks built to withstand a siege. It even has large undeveloped areas in the points of the snowflake where you could bring livestock into the city wall to sustain its inhabitants when farmers in surrounding areas take shelter inside.

Second comment of the day goes to /u/Mecanno-man 

> Before watching Episode 4, I will say something more about Episode 3 that I noticed while reading the Episode 3 comments, yet has nothing to do with any of them really: Episode 3 does not fit the story on a meta-level. Why is that? Well, Eleina is the protagonist. Not of the anime, but of her own book - she is essentially writing an autobiography. And it is this book that the anime is adapting, based on her being the narrator. We see that Eleina wants to present herself as a bit of Miss Perfect to everybody in the way she interacts with other people. Other than the guard and her own parents, I can’t think of anybody she has not tried to come across as well-behaved and going above and beyond what would be considered polite other than the young guard. Be it with how she dealt with Sayu stealing her broche or taking the request from the poison flower girl. Even her handling the broken jar for the slave owner was something that would help everybody present - the slave owner gets his china repaired, the slave doesn’t get yelled at and the boy doesn’t see his love interest abused. Nobody present could be mad at that in universe. Yet if we see this in the context of it being in the book, it is easy to criticize her for what she didn’t do, both in the case of the slave owner (which might be ok in-universe) and in the case of the flowers. Given that she is also the author, I don’t see why this would be included without a justification for her actions in her own words, especially given that she has already admitted to using underhanded tactics in the exam, so I’d assume improving her own image by omission would not be beyond her.

Last comment goes to /u/fieew 

> Best episode by far. Without actually monologuing to the audience this episode showed the princess’s power, feelings and personality. The princess's personality shown was as such, she was able to cook and bake great food most likely cause of her relationship with the cook, she had a snide and strong personality shown in the letter she wrote to herself, she KNEW she would win against the monster. She’s utterly broken over the loss of her lover and child, shown by 3 seats at the table. The show didn’t tell us explicitly what happened to the baby but we can infer. This episode had a lot of show and not tell. This episode fixed my previous complaints about the last 3, we got to know and feel connected to the princess through most of the episode. Then that investment we had to the princess culminated in the final battle along with the reveal of what the princess had done and why. It was fantastic.

> My biggest gripe with the show is investment with the characters. Past characters, all felt like nothing more than props meant to move the story forward culminating in a reveal at the end of their respective stories. The characters didn't feel organic and I had no investment to them. All previous characters felt like they were meant to serve a purpose in the story with nothing else beyond what the episode needed to show. Comparatively the princess felt like a fleshed out character that Elaina just happened to witness her story. As opposed to feeling like a prop the princess was fleshed out organically. The difference between is subtle but very important to me personally. I want my characters to feel like they have lives outside of a short story in Elaina's story which the princess did.

> TLDR: I actually felt investment with the new character we met, and if every episode were this good this show would be a 9/10 for me. Amazing episode.

392,Looking for an Anime with High Fantasy Elements,11myawa," 

Hey everyone,

I'm in the mood for a good anime that has a high fantasy setting. I'm talking about a world filled with magic, mythical creatures, and epic battles between good and evil. I want something that will completely immerse me in a fantastical world and leave me wanting more.

I'm looking for something new and exciting. I don't mind if it's a classic or a newer anime, as long as it has a captivating story and compelling characters.

Some of my favorite high fantasy books and movies include The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and The Chronicles of Narnia, so if there's an anime that can give me a similar experience, I would be ecstatic.

So, do you guys have any recommendations for me? I would love to hear what you think are the best high fantasy anime out there. Thanks in advance!",Critical_Equipment_7,56,20,0.86

**Fae Facts:**

Will o' wisps and other marsh light phenomenon are seen around the world, usually as malicious or mischievous creatures that lead folks astray, unlike the positive spin we see here.  In literature they are understood to have a metaphorical meaning describing a hope or goal that leads one on but is impossible to reach, or something one finds sinister and confounding.

**Incantations:**

Tie now the silver thread

Tie now the roots of our veins

The holly, so that we may not be separated

The ivy, so that we may not come apart

Tie to the yew tree seven times

Until the day the snake spits out its tail

**Discussion Topics:**

Chise continues to completely no-sell the shocking occurrences around her. Is she fearless? So traumatized as to be numb?

Any sympathy to spare for Renfred and Alice, knowing now that they were coerced into helping Cartaphilus/Joseph?

**Manga/BTS:**

\[Chapters 11-12\]>!They tell us the meaning of Ruth’s name, “Sorrowful friend”, from Hebrew. I also personally think it might have been chosen for the double meaning with the way it's pronounced in the series, like ""root""!<

**Selected Favourite Quotes and Images from Last Episode:**

""A master protects his apprentice.""

""P.S. It's not for your left ring finger...yet!""

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

We had a lot of good comments, but in particular one stood out among the rest for me and that was /u/Elimin8r



> So, yeah, pretty heavy episode today. When I first saw it, I was somewhat taken aback, but not really, because as a [Jack Vance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Vance) reader, I'm used to this sort of thing. The short version of this explanation is that he wrote many sci-fi fantasy books, which often featured a protagonist (heh) who went on a series of [picaresque adventures.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque)

> Now, that is not to try to equate Elaina with [Cugel the Clever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_of_the_Overworld), but ... I feel like there is a certain overlap in terms of themes to their adventures, which is to say - don't always expect a happy ending.

> Bad things happen to good people. Often explicitly to good people.

> So, in this episode, we first saw the adventures of Audrey, I mean ... Elaina as she encountered a field of carnivorous flowers, and the aftermath thereof. Poor sis/bro, right? Yeah. That was pretty twilight zone, and stuff, right?

> But it's the second part of the episode that ... yeah. Bottled happiness, you say. Watching it for the second time, I felt like it hit even harder as I noticed the things that I didn't quite notice the first time around. Or maybe that I didn't want to notice. I'll leave it to others to point them out in detail.

> I just remember that at the time this episode came out, there was a big hullabaloo over it, because Elaina's the hero, right? Why didn't she do anything about it? Yeah.

> Well, looking at it again, she almost did. You can see how her wand lingers over boss-man's throat, and she's obviously thinking about it, but in the end, she repaired the vase, and went on her way, leaving the situation as is. Do you agree, was this the right answer?

> It's hard to know. Of course, there was the ultimate cruelty of the ""bottled happiness"", and the reveal of the ending of the 'fairy tale'. Yeah.

> And so, I wish to mention, once again, Jack Vance. Among other things, before taking up writing, he spent several years in the merchant marine, including during the war, in which he no doubt saw, learned, and probably experienced first hand many unpleasant things. This shows in his writing in which characters are often many layered, and have motivations both noble and sinister. Quite often the latter. What does that have to do with anything? Oh, I don't know ...

> Except that I think that our sanitized media culture and its ongoing desire to ""Disneyfy"" everything does us a disservice. Life isn't always clean and neat, and bad things often happen to good people. Often especially to good people, because they're naive and easily victimized. Much like the morons who go to the national parks and attempt to pet the bison, or feed the bears, a cartoonish outlook on life can often lead to tragic results.

> In this case, we know that Elaina's Mother explicitly told her that if things were going south, don't be a hero, get the hell out of Dodge. Is it any surprise that she obeyed her Mother? Would you or I have done anything different in the situation? If so, do you think we would have survived it??? Heh. Life isn't a convenient fiction.

> Which is the greater sin? Slavery or murder? Who assigns guilt (although it was confessed in this case)? Who appoints one to be judge, jury and executioner? It's upsetting, and even enraging, but do you or I in the comfort of our chairs have the right to judge Elaina for her action or inaction?

> These are things I later wish I'd though to say back then, but I was too busy being stunned by it all and not thinking straight, or something.

> Thinking about it now, I'm reminded of some things, like (warning, bad stuff here) ...

> The picture of the girl and the vulture. I was going to link it here, but even now, looking at it is too heartbreaking. Google it if you dare. The poor fellow who took that picture eventually committed suicide. Can't imagine why. Could he have saved her? I have no idea - it was probably too late, the poor girl was dying/nearly dead. What could he have done - could we have done better?

> The picture of the Afghan girl. Again, feel free to google it - this one is quite a bit safer. NatGeo's most famous picture, it seems. A young Afghan girl with the most stunning eyes, and looking at it even now, you can see the haunting in them. There's a follow on, decades later (literally), and you can see that the years have not been kind to her. Why didn't they rescue her?

> We've seen/heard of/read about the people who are violated/robbed/killed and people stand around and watch/video, and do nothing to save them. Are we (society) any better?

> The soldiers in Afghanistan who encountered a village elder abusing a young boy and (if I recall correctly) actually did try to do something about it. I think they gave him (the elder) a good thrashing. How did that work out for them? Yeah.

> We live in a world that [eats heroes for breakfast.](https://youtu.be/qAd7EMfQrck) Yeah...

> Right this moment, there are bad things going on all over the world. A madman in charge of a nuclear armed country is committing mass murder in a neighboring country. (They politely call it ""war""...) People are dying of overwork, or overdoses. Children are suffering, be it hunger or abuse. A certain country (or two) are in the midst of committing genocide. And slavery ... there are more slaves now than at any point in human history.

> Oh, those last two, a certain country we can probably all recall is literally perpetrating both, right now. And what do we do about it? Do we point our wand at their leaders and take them out as we wish Elaina had with the village leader? No ... we reward them by paying our hard earned cash for their cheap (heh) consumer goods.

> Go figure. Our hands are dirty too. I have no answers. I don't expect it to get any better, and I have no idea how to prevent it from getting worse. Even now, little children are toiling away in cobalt mines so that we can virtue signal with our battery operated vehicles. Are we happy now?

> So, yeah. There's a part of me that so wishes that like Fran, Elaina had pointed her wand at the jerk's head and blown it right off. And then what? Kill his son too? Because the poor kid probably wouldn't take it sitting down - even if he lives, he'd be traumatized and his life probably ruined. Rescue the girl and take her back to her home? Fight off the rest of the village when they came to the leader's rescue? Who knows??? I don't have the answers, and neither did Elaina.

> So ... I won't blame her for her actions, or inaction. Sometimes you walk in on a tragedy. Sometimes the best you can do is hope that the tragedy doesn't rub off on you.

> In the end, I found her words as she flew away haunting. She didn't want to know. She knows well enough. There is no happy ending to that story.

411,Yugioh 5ds 15th Anniversary Rewatch Interest Thread,11mb4oj,"
**[What is it](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3972/Yu%E2%98%86Gi%E2%98%86Oh_5Ds)**

This April 2nd, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5d's is going to be celebrating it's 15th Anniversary. I am curious if anyone is interested in doing a series Rewatch of 5d's to celebrate the series turning 15.

**Let's Get Up To Speed With Yu-Gi-Oh! 5d's**

Yu-Gi-Oh! 5ds is the third series in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise, and the first series not to have Yugi, Kaiba or any connection to the original series. 5d's stands on it's own as it's own original story. 

Directed by *Katsumi Ono* of Symphogear fame, the series was initially met with skeptism due to the ridiculousness of Card Games on Motorcycles that was meme'd upon, but very quickly 5ds became a huge fan favorite. It's now widely considered the best Yu-Gi-Oh! series. 

**Schedule**

For a long anime like Yu-Gi-Oh! with more than 150 episodes, I think it'd be better if we went for a weekly format. To that end, here would be the schedule: 

Week | Date | Episodes | # of Episodes
---|---|----|----
1 | April 2nd | 1-5 | 5
2 | April 9th | 6-12 | 7
3 | April 16th | 13-19 | 7
4 | April 23rd | 20-26 | 7
5 | April 30th | 27-31 | 5
6 | May 7th | 32-39 | 8
7 | May 14th | 40-44 | 5
8 | May 21st | 45-50 | 6
9 | May 28th | 51-57 | 7
10 | June 4th | 58-64 | 7
11 | June 11th | 65-70 | 6
12 | June 18th | 71-78 | 8
13 | June 25th | 79-85 | 7
14 | July 2nd | 86-92 | 7
15 | July 9th | BBT+EE* | 2
16 | July 16th | 93-97 | 5
17 | July 23rd | 98-102 | 5
18 | July 30th | 103-110 | 8
19 | August 6th | 111-117 | 7
20 | August 13th | 118-122 | 5
21 | August 20th | 123-129 | 7
22 | August 27th | 130-136 | 7
23 | September 3rd | 137-145 | 9
24 | September 10th | 146-152 | 7
25 | September 17th | 153-154 | 2

*BBT refers to the Bonds Beyond Time movie. It's a triple crossover featuring Yugi, Jaden and Yusei all teaming up. It doesn't require any prior knowledge of the two previous series. and while it's called a ""Movie"" and was in theaters, it's only 40 minutes long.  
* EE refers to the Evolving Evolution OVA. This is an out of continuity duel for fun. Not required watching, but can be fun. 

**Time**

I'd like to go for 20:00 GMT/UTC,  15:00 EST, 12:00 PST, but I'm still working on it. 

**Dub or Sub**

Please, I beg of you, watch this subbed. The dub is literally a 4kids production. I grew up on the original Yu-Gi-Oh! and GX dub, and I can appreciate them for what they are, but 5ds is a different beast that deserves to be seen in the original sub. It even has music by the legendary Masaki Endoh of Jam Project fame.

Not to mention the dub doesn't even adapt the final arc. So to see the complete series, you will have to be watching it subbed sooner or later, it's better to just do it from the beginning. 

Crunchyroll has the subbed version of the series available for streaming",lilyvess,39,51,0.89

Comments of the Day:

/u/TheEscapeGuy [has more solid commentary](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11leh4f/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_42/jbbyhg8/):

>Also on that topic, it's worth noting that the cast were ""playing"" characters in today's episode. But remember, the voice actors of CCS are also playing characters. It's not an easy job to act as a character acting as another character. You can very quickly fall into the trap of just performing as the other character. However, I found all the voice actors this episode to do an amazing job. When Sakura's VA was performing it felt like Sakura acting as The Prince, it felt Meiling acting as The Witch etc. Major kudos to the voice actors today.

&nbsp;

On an important note, no unmarked spoilers! No jokes about events yet to come, and no references to future episodes!

**Reminder that there will be another inter-seasonal break on the 12th and 13th, with an end of arc discussion thread on the 12th.**

424,ONIMAI Episode 9 - Japanese Trivia and Nuances Lost in Translation,11lztyp,"*For those that missed my previous posts, this is a post where I talk about some trivia on Japanese culture and some nuances that were lost in the translation from the Japanese audio to the English subtitles of the  newest episode of Onii-chan ha Oshimai! (ONIMAI:I'm Now Your Sister!). I'm using the subs from CrunchyRoll since it's probably the ones that most people watches the show with.*

*Disclaimer: This is only meant to be as interesting things that I wanted to share, and not as saying that the official translation was bad or wrong. Translations between two languages are often interpretations and translators tries to make a compelling story for their target audience. Also, I'm not a native speaker of either English or Japanese, so don't take anything I say as gospel.*

# Episode 9 ([Video format](https://youtu.be/W1zN92ffBM0))

## Enjoying Christmas [0m08]

The expression that was used to convey the meaning of people ""enjoying"" the Christmas spirit, is with 一色(isshoku), which usually just mean ""One Color"", but it can also be used when a bunch of people at the same place share a similar intense feeling.

You could say that it's a bit in the same vein as saying in English: ""Everyone was painted with the same brush"", but not necessarily in a negative sense.

It's also often used, like in this case, as part of the sentence クリスマスムード一色(kurisumasu muudo isshoku): ""Christmas Mood"" ""One Color""

## Go-getter [10m13]

What Mihari used to describe Mahiro as a ""go-getter"" in Japanese, was with the expression 隅に置けない(sumi ni okenai).

In a literal sense, it comes as ""can't put in a corner"", to talk about someone that was unexpected to be that experienced or talented at doing something.

The origin of the expression comes from the contrast between something put in the middle of a room versus in a corner. The thing that is in the middle is gonna stand out a lot more and be easily seen, as opposed as something put in the corner and in the shadows of a room.

And you are bound to be a lot more surprised at what you might find in the shadows than in the center of a room.

So, as to not be accidently surprised by something, you ""can't put it in a corner"", otherwise you might not see it coming.

Source: [https://usable-idioms.com/550](https://usable-idioms.com/550)

## Had me Fooled [11m28]

When Mahiro get surprised by Mihari giving him the scarf gift, he used a common Japanese expression: 一本取られた(ippon torareta), to convey the meaning of someone having ""took one point"" over you.

It comes from different competitive sports like Kendou and Judou, where you get one point ""一本(ippon)"" when a technique lands on your opponent.

## Find Yourself [15m26]

Once again in this episode, the term 中二病(chuunibyou) was used, but this time to talk about Momiji trying to act cool.

Mahiro used 治る(naoru) afterward, which was translated into ""find yourself"". The Japanese meaning is of ""healing"", ""to be cured"", which links with the 病(byou) in 中二病(chuunibyou) that depicts it as an ""illness""

## Greedy [16m06]

When the group is praying at the shrine, and Momiji says that her sister is being ""greedy"", she uses a term that comes from Buddhism 煩悩(bon'nou), that are ""worldly desires"" or ""Kleshas"" for a more closer transliteration of the Sanskrit term. It can be seen a little bit like the 7 deadly sins of the Christian religion.

# New Year

In this episode there were also a lot of things surrounding the Japanese New Year holiday season and since it would take a long time to talk about every single things and that it's probably not everyone that is interested in knowing all the details, I'll quickly talk about the things that I think are the most interesting ones.

## New Year's Eve [12m11]

Let's start with the Japanese name of New Year's Eve, that was omitted in the subtitles during the kotatsu scene: 大晦日(oomisoka).

It is the second most important day of the year in the Japanese culture, with New Year being the first one.

To get a better understanding of it's origin, let's first look at the different Kanji used in the term. The first and last one are pretty simple, ""Big""(大) and ""Day""(日).

For the middle one(晦), it's a pretty rare Kanji that has a meaning associated with the state of the moon and when it disappear.

晦日(misoka) comes from Japan's old calendar that was divided following the moon cycles, with the first day being the day of the new moon, and the last day(晦日), was when the moon disappear.

When Japan adopted the new and current calendar, even though it didn't really fit anymore with the new moon day, it became synonyms for the last day of the month.

And when adding the ""big""(大) Kanji before it to get 大晦日(oomisoka), it refers to the last day of the last month: New Year's Eve.

## Happy New Year

There was some abbreviations that were used when celebrating the New Year.

*\[15m02\]* Kaede and Mahiro said あけおめ(akeome), which comes from あけましておめでとう(akemashite omedetou): ""Happy New Year"" 

It can also be viewed in a more literal sense as something like ""best wishes for the (new) dawn (of the year)"".

*\[17m03\]* And Asahi and Miyo responded with ことよろ(kotoyoro), which in turns comes from ことしもよろしく(kotoshi mo yoroshiku). 

The よろしく(yoroshiku) part is the kind of expression that is a bit hard to translate directly in English, and if you have watched a lot of anime, you probably have a certain feel for the meaning, but in this context it basically comes down to something like ""continue to treat me well this year""

## Osechi [18m10]

It could be understood by the context, but おせち(osechi) is a part of the new Year festivities where you prepare a meal to eat with other people.

It comes from 御節料理(osechi ryouri), ""food cooking for the (turning) of seasons""

Initially the festival was one of 5 seasonal(節) festival of the Imperial Court in the Heian Period(794-1185) where they would make food using vegetables from the season, often accompanied by toufu, konnyaku and kombu, to present the good harvest of the season and pay gratitude to the gods

The meal comes in a stack of meal box with some rules to follow. Originally it was made with 5 layers, but nowadays most people goes with a 3 layers version. So it shows even more that Kaede really went all in. You might have caught that we only see 4 layers in this episode, and that as to do with the rules surrounding the preparation.

Normally, you separate the layers with different types of food.

The first one is for Appetizers, the second one for Grilled Food, the next two can be interchanged, but one is for Boiled or Steamed Food, and the other one Vinegared or Pickled Food. 

The fifth and last layer, is kept empty, and is used to reserved a place to be filled with the good fortune for the next year or season

So that's why we only see 4 boxes.

For those wondering, the 3 Layers version is putting the Grilled and Pickled Food in the same layer and doesn't have an empty one.

Also, like they talked about in this episode, a lot of the food has some meaning behind them. I won't go over all the possible food and their meaning because there's a lot of them, but I just wanted to add that with the Black beans meaning to ""work hard"", it has to do with a pun with まめ(mame) being the pronunciation for bean(豆), but also for a word that can mean ""hardworking""(忠実)

## Omikuji [16m36]

During the おみくじ(omikuji) scene, which is a fortune telling thing that you see a lot in shrines, even though Asahi is asking a pretty obvious question about which is higher between 小吉(shoukichi) ""small blessing"" and 大吉(daikichi) ""great blessing"", this is something that comes up a lot in anime and even IRL, often wondering about the order between 吉(blessing) 中吉(middle blessing) and 小吉(small blessing).

Normally the order would be ""Great Blessing(大吉)"", ""Blessing(吉)"", ""Middle Blessing(中吉)"", ""Small Blessing(小吉)"", and ""Bad Luck(凶)"".

But sometimes 中吉 would be higher than 吉, and sometimes there's even more levels of blessing. So in the end, it really depends on the different shrines and what they decided as their orders.

## Traditional Game [17m57]

[The game that we see briefly Asahi and Momiji play](https://imgur.com/a/wu7cHC2) is called 羽根突き(hanetsuki) and is a traditional Japanese game that is a bit similar to badminton. It became kind of a tradition to play it during the New Year festivities.

Another part of that tradition is that if you fail to hit the ""ball"", the other person can draw something on your face, usually an 'X', like we can see on Asahi's face.

## End Card

In my post of last week, I didn't include this for episode 8, but I started to look up the artist that draws the End Card of the episodes. I didn't think that I could add anything interesting in a written post, but this week's artist uses a pen name.

The person credited for [this one](https://imgur.com/a/TkeIwCc) is おこりなしよ(okorinashiyo), which, if you reverse the order, becomes よしなりこお: [Yoshinari Kou(吉成鋼)](https://anilist.co/staff/102136/Kou-Yoshinari)",Toki_Madoushi,5,108,0.81

426,Top Five MAPPA Anime - Baka Banter Podcast,11lzgpy,"MAPPA has become one of the biggest powerhouses in the modern anime landscape, growing rapidly from a studio founded for creative freedom to a corporate site for large franchises. In this episode of our anime podcast, we discuss the studio's varied productions as well as its reputation for tight schedules, egregiously low pay for animators, and a culture of overwork that is, unfortunately, representative of the state of the anime industry today. Then, we pick our top five MAPPA anime, from battle shounen like 'Chainsaw Man' and 'Jujutsu Kaisen' to shoujo and josei adaptations like 'Banana Fish' and 'Kids on the Slope.'

434,why hasnt anyone made a scary anime?,11lkzze,"Im not talking about horror anime that use creepy creatures or just your run of the mill horror story. I think that its fully possible to make use of how anime portrays humans to make a very scary anime without relying on classic tricks.

 Younger anime characters first of all in most animation types are alot bigger then humans in scale. (Im not talking about things like fan service or animes like one piece where size is bassicly random) there heads and eyes are almost always as big as their chest unlike most children-teens having heads which are located inbtween the shoulders. The easiest example of this is anya from spy x family. 

Theres quite litearly no way that anyas body could support her massive head its almost BIGGER then her chest including her shoulders. There has to be a way to use things like this and other tropes in anime to make a scary anime.

 Another thing I can think of is how anime portrays teeth being a singluar tooth across the jaw. If that was animated more realisticly then thats actually imo a very scary thing to see. As an example, take the old sonic movie design. The features where off and his teeth made it grotesque and scary looking. That happened because they tried to convert cartoon to irl. If you do something similar like that to a anime you could make something terrifying.

I guess what I'm saying is I just want a scary anime that doesn't rely on classic horror (because ima be honest it doesn't work the best in anime compared to a live action horror movie or a cgi horror film)",mt5567,30,0,0.27

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

First comment of the day goes to /u/MTNDuwu 

This encounter is one that stuck with me quite a bit the first time I watched it and made it a show to watch when it first came out. I enjoyed how despicable Saya's actions were, but how grounded the handling of it was. Elaina's reaction is a testament to her experience and maturity, and it shows why her training as a witch was so important. She didn't burn a relationship in a way that could make her seem harsh, and she was able to help her pupil in a way that at least made the time she taught her worth something. Part of it is her being a softie because she sees Saya in herself, of course. Something that I noticed is that they added undertones to show why Saya could be so desperate. Elaina's experiences with the hotels would seem to suggest their society js one where witches are high class while those who can't perform magic aren't as much. It wouldn't be great to be a young person stuck in a place like that alone, but the path witches need to take make it a necessary experience. Intereting premise and world building.

Second comment of the day goes to /u/hiimneato

I think this episode's a perfect illustration of the fact that Elaina's prone to vanity and even a bit of arrogance, but isn't cold or narcissistic at all. When she puts the pieces together and realizes what Saya's been doing, she doesn't just solve the case, she understands why Saya did it, and what she's been feeling. She responds firmly, draws clear boundaries, tells Saya exactly what's wrong, and doesn't let her mope or whine; but she's also sympathetic and doesn't punish her more harshly than she needs to, and even does something really kind to help her get through the loneliness by giving her a big ol' hat.

Last comment of the day goes to /u/Tartaras1

Saya stealing the broach so Elaina was essentially forced to stay and teach her also brings in a thought I had throughout the series. Not everyone is going to be perfect, or friendly, or honest. People have their own motives, like Saya intentionally ramming into her.

Okay for real this is the last last comment of the day by /u/StereoxAS  who literally commented as I was posting this up.

> I kinda dislike Saya because of this one episode. How can you do that kind of thing, that's definitely the creepiest thing you can imagine. Like how can you dislike mushroom stew??

>Okay... I have to admit that when I saw the title ""Sakura, Shaoran, and the Sea of Sand"" it took me legit like a full minute to realise that they were talking about China. This is the consequence of giving all the characters nicknames lol.

/u/Shimmering-Sky [called it](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11kh5cl/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_41/jb754ua/):

>Pokémon says you can beat sand with water (because Ground-Types are weak to Water-Types). I wonder what the play here is gonna be?

>Oh shit, that was right? Watery + Freeze was a good combo here actually, good on Xiaolang/Syaoran for calling that.

**Questions of the Day, courtesy of u/chilidirigible:**

1) Berger clearly has put a major spin on his interpretation of music for his Ultimate Slideshow of Ultimate Destiny, but is he not also correct, from a certain point of view?

2) Does *Macross* need a(nother) multifactional megacorp? Are those an icing on the cake for mecha series?

447,[Hunter x Hunter] Can someone explain the ending of Yorknew City for me?,11l3xh1,"Spoilers for just up to Yorknew (Unless stated otherwise,) but I'm currently finishing Greed Island.

First of all, the trade. After Pakunoda's death, there's a flashback in which Gon and Killua tell her they don't want their friend to be a killer. This line confuses me for two reasons.

1. I don't think this is a spoiler but considering discussion around Gon that I've osmosis'd, he doesn't seem like the type to really care. Killua simultaneously makes the most sense and the least sense since he grew up as a  cold-blooded assassin but that might also be why he wouldn't want someone to go through that. Most importantly though,

2. Kurapika already killed someone. Like it was a whole big deal. And while he did feel disgust at how brutal he was (not really regret or guilt I think,) I thought he would have it in him to end the big bad boss. His solution with the binding seems dangerously risky especially now knowing \[Greed Island\] >!The spiders can free him and set him loose again...!<  


Secondly, the whole actual ending scene in the auction I genuinely don't understand. When they run into Feitan and Phinks (seemingly the most bloodlusted members,) and they spare them for some reason. They really seemed like the characters who'd want revenge whatever outcome was actually reached in the end. And why couldn't they kill the chain user again? I straight up don't understand the dialogue at that part.

**Fae Facts:**

Although the idea of a fairy queen and king appears in many celtic myths and legends, the origin of the name ""Titania"" comes from the Shakespeare play, and has perpetuated itself thanks to its popularity.

**Incantations:**

Sing, sing, sing.

Ruffle, trees, in the wind,

Let not the sunlight pass

Dance, flowers and grass,

let not your scent be lost for direction.

Sing praise, homeless bird, that the mistress of the night shall not tear off your wings.

Return to the earth and sing, flutter in the skies, and sing,

bow your head to the noble garden and sing

for the great Gealach of Tir Na Nog has arrived.

**Discussion Topics:**

Have you had any experiences that helped you turn your life around?

Do you think Elias is truly as unfeeling and inhuman as he acts?

460,Top 5 favorite Manga artists/anime artstyles,11kkhv9,"This is in no order, but these are just some of my favorite manga artists

1: Kohei Horikoshi (This man has one of my favorite artstyles  in all of shonen and he has some of the best and appealing character designs I've ever seen. The MVA arc and latest arc in the anime had absolutely incredible art in the manga that could legitimately stand on their own as a piece of art, and the fact that he did this on a very strict weekly schedule just goes to show how truly skilled he is at his work)

2: Akira Toriyama (He has the some of the best anatomy I've seen in a manga or anime. His paneling is great and only ever rivaled by Tite Kubo, plus it's just iconic and unique awesome artstyle that most shonen look nothing like)

3: Hajime Isayama (The artstyle is a little more realistic than most shonen, and around the end of the series or the final Arc, the art in the manga is absolutely incredible and perfectly showcase the massive scale event that was happening. Some of the panels in that arc could be literal paintings, that's just how much higher quality than a usual manga panel they are!)

4: Hirohiko Araki (The most realistic and unique artstyle in possibly all of shonen/seinen. Araki has some of the best anatomy I've ever seen in a manga alongside some of the best character designs I've ever seen in a manga. Despite JoJo having a massive character cast, all of them feel unique and creative and all of their designs more or less fit the character and their personality. The anime only amplifies how good the manga's artstyle is)


5: Masashi Kishimoto (Naruto's artstyle is probably my favorite! The character designs are great, it's very appealing to look at, the paneling is the best out of the big 3 imo, and the characters fitting in with the background are amazing. I can think of two off the top of my head and both of them involve Pain. Definitely my favorite out of the Big 3)",DickWriter69,20,0,0.5
461,"After being into anime for close to 40 years, Masaaki Yuasa's Kaiba (2008) is one of my personal favorites of all time",11ki6no,"I love the Tezuka-on-mescaline art style.

I love the music, including the intro and outro songs, and the overall score.

I love the characters, story, and voice acting.

I love the intro sequence.

I love the symbolism and mystical profundity.

This is anime that you feel in a few chakras, if you let it. Warp is The Demiurge, and Warp is us. Kaiba, entropy, that all-consuming weed that devours everything, in the end (and from which things begin anew).

Any other Kaiba fans in the house?",EthanSayfo,27,86,0.89

### **Comment(s) of the Day**

First comment of the day goes to /u/Venthorn first for their use of the main catchphrase to start off the post, but then  for the rest. 

> Who's that rewatcher who bravely forges on ahead revisiting the past, remaining young, beautiful, and wide-eyed optimistic at heart despite the relentless march of time? That's right, it's me!

> The visuals of this show are absolutely astounding. The backgrounds are incredibly beautiful. The characters stand out great. The fight scenes are brief but go shockingly hard, and have an immense sense of bombast and presence to them. Also the atmosphere is incredible. Nothing has ever screamed out ""magic!"" to me like that whole treehouse which then Fran just straight up disappeared when she was done.

> This episode hits a point that I think every parent has struggled with. How do you teach your child about the harsh realities of the world and the people in it, before they set off for the world? It's worse if the child is gifted. You don't want them to become arrogant. Elaina's parents were clearly concerned about that, and handled it the best way they knew how. Maybe having Fran beat her up to teach her that there's always a bigger fish is not the best way to handle such a child, but there's no perfect way. But it's exactly the sort of tough love that you need to drill into your child before they go off on such a journey. The world is a harsh place, and fostered arrogance is only going to lead to problems.

Second goes to /u/Esovan13 who didn't get distracted by all the flashy magic and was able to pinpoint the source of Elaina's superior skill.

> Also, don't let this episode fool you. The reason for Elaina's magical prowess has nothing to do with studying or training. It is solely due to the incredible size of her hat.

The final comment of the day goes to a late commenter /u/cppn02 who posted this 

> [Fran negotiating with Elaina's parents.](https://i.imgur.com/h46POnq.png)

Question of the Day:

How excited are you to see the play?

&nbsp;

Comments of the Day:

/u/lolpete18 [provided some excellent reasoning of an earlier scene of the episode](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11jgt2o/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_40/jb3apsv/):

>Here's my claim: Meiling had her omen dream when she was looking at the wedding dress. There are a lot of reasons to think this was the DREAM card at work, even though we didn't see it in that moment. While we couldn't tell if the adult silhouette was Syaoran or not, Meiling would know because it was dreamed up by her, and she looked happy after it was over. So this was clearly a prophecy confirming that she'll end up married to Syaoran in the end. Quod erat demonstrandum. 

/u/TheEscapeGuy [had some great technical analysis](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11jgt2o/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_40/jb2iyga/):

>The direction choice here was masterful. Right from when Sakura enters the building, all the way up until she wakes up into her usual dream, every shot is at a Dutch angle. Without any exposition or special effects, just this camera angle tells you that something is wrong.

>But they do pump up the effects. The blinding white light flooding into every scene makes everything feel eerie. The whole sequence just had me on the edge of my seat.

&nbsp;

On an important note, no unmarked spoilers! No jokes about events yet to come, and no references to future episodes!

**Reminder that there will be another inter-seasonal break on the 12th and 13th, with an end of arc discussion thread on the 12th.**

**Clow Card Fortune Book**

**Today's card:**

**[THE SAND](https://imgur.com/a/2euq2Yb)**

The challenge to change without fear.

**Playing Card when Substituted:** 9 of Diamonds

**Card’s Message:**

Time and a person’s feelings change constantly, yet they are always in existence so there is no single point of view. Reconciliation with the friend or the lover is sure to go well too, if it is taken one step at a time.

**Card’s Warning:**

Do you not notice the person who thinks you are important? They are actually surprisingly closer then you realize.

**Synopsis**:


*""Cute girls doing cute things in cute ways.""*

Everyday things make up the fabric of life—whether it's making friends, going to school, trying to make money, or celebrating a holiday. Ichigo Mashimaro is a heartwarming series depicting the everyday life of four pre-adolescent girls and their older sister figure, Strawberry Marshmallow (Ichigo Mashimaro in the original Japanese) doesn't have excessive drama, or supernatural events, or giant robots. Just the antics of five girls, two 12 year olds, two 11 year olds, acting somewhat cuter and funnier than perhaps is entirely realistic, and their questionably high schooler older sister. 

---

##Why should you watch it?

Ichigo Mashimaro is a chill out SOL comedy with close to zero fanservice (unless you think Coppola dressing up as a cute girl count as fanservice)

Yes, honest! Believe it or not but I don't only host questionably ecchi series!! I'm back to my roots for this one. After the mentally exhausting KnJ and the physically draining KissxSis I think we all deserve a break and to return to the joys of the mid 00's moe slice of life scene. 

Ichigo Mashimaro is a 2002 *Shonen* manga by Lolicon Legend Barasui who channeled his wise knowledge and craft into making this relaxed and chilled out healing manga about a questionable high school delinquent getting her daily dose of moe from her kid sister and her friends. It has spawned the 2005 anime adaptation that we will be watching along with a visual novel. That right, Ichigo E-Sports over here! 

Fans of moe, slice of life, iyashikei, and cute kids doing cute things will be right at home. There is some depth behind the show if you decide to dedicate yourself to searching it out but you can sit back and bask in the healing comfort of the 00's if you so prefer. 

---
##Fun Stuff

As usual I will be asking multiple QotD's to help kick off discussion. *""If you answer correctly you're a boss!~""*      
And I've decided that I am also gonna be keeping an eye open for cultured and insightful comments to show off to the rest of the rewatch crowd! Make sure you reply to **three** separate members to be valid and have your comment showcased. We will have CotD's after all!      
I would lastly love to see everyone picking out a screenshot or visual of the day that caught your eye. Don't be shy, we all know why we're here!      
And for our fourth section, I'm pleased to be bringing back **Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!""** In this section I will be posting a preview pic of the following episode. Your challenge is to dedicate a small write up about the ""thematic"" purpose of said scene~ The best submission will get a dedicated spot in our patented Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene winner's corner!!""

For me it has to be link click’s ending, not only is the song great, but they manage to integrate it towards the end of the episode itself right at the cliffhanger and it always gives me chills, the eerie vibe fits so well.

483,Just finished Season 2 and halfway through Season 3 of My Hero Academia!,11k1atd," 

Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share that I've made some progress with My Hero Academia! I've finished watching Season 2 and I'm halfway through Season 3. I have to say, I'm really enjoying the series so far. The characters are great and the storyline is really engaging.

Without spoiling anything, I have to say that the sports festival arc in Season 2 was really exciting to watch. It was really cool to see all of the characters competing against each other and using their quirks in creative ways. And now in Season 3, things are getting even more intense with the introduction of new villains and more intense battles.

I'm really looking forward to finishing Season 3 and seeing what happens next. I've heard that there are even more seasons to come, so I'm excited to see where the series goes from here.

If anyone has any recommendations for other anime to watch that are similar to My Hero Academia, please let me know! I'm always looking for new shows to watch.

Thanks for reading, and I hope everyone is having a great day!",Critical_Equipment_7,5,0,0.4

488,Dropping episodes in a big batch will always be the worst way to release ongoing series,11ju9pa,"Stone Ocean was my favorite JoJo part and the batch release absolutely ruined it. The most anticipated JoJo release in forever and it lead to nobody talking about it and nobody caring as far as I've seen, and I'm often in the JoJo communities

We've bitched about Netflix batch release long enough, so it's beating a dead horse tenfold at this point, but another anime decided to go for this approach which was Attack on Titan: The Final Season: The Final Chapters: First Half which combined 3 episodes into one long 1 hour episode


There was immediately discourse and buzz surrounding the extremely anticipated return of Shingeki No Kyojin! It however has been 3 days since release and the whole conversation and basically dwindled into nothing as everybody burned through it in the first day or two, and with no weekly episode to look forward to; most people moved on to wait for the final final episode in Fall

The problem is not that the weekly discourse doesn't exist, the problem is that these shows are formatted in weekly episode releases for a reason! They build tension and hype between episodes and use cliffhangers to keep you thinking about it until the next week's episode! Attack on Titan used that formula to the absolute fullest of its abilities, and it resulted in a very unique and anticipating release every episode",DickWriter69,22,7,0.55

491,i have completed bleach including tybw and here is my review,11jqtvo,"There are many good points and many bad points about bleach.

Good points:
It's very satisfying when things which are kept mysterious are later explained in a very good timing after hundreds of episodes. I love aizen's character, he is the best villain i have seen in anime. Whenever aizen is on screen, the  story exponentialy improves. The openings are so underrated bangers. You can listen to all of them a hundred times. The tybw have one of the greatest animation. I watched bleach because of the release of tybw and i can say i don't regret watching bleach.

Bad points:
The animation is sometimes shit. I don't blame the studio Pierrot for it had to release each episode every week without break and also considering that at one point for many many dozens of episodes there where continuous nonstop fighting. Sometimes the animation was good, for example when renji was fighting byakuya. His bankai looked terrifying but when he fought the arancars, his bankai looked ass. One of my main issue with this show is that no matter who the opponent is, both of them will take their time talking to each other revealing thier power system for no reason at all. When byakuya fought that wierd looking arrancar, they spent most of the time talking out who is more arrogant, like dude, your sister is about to die and you have so much time talking to your enemy as if both of you are long lost friend. One problem is that the comedy is good but the timings are bad. Like really bad. For example, in every case when a bunch of people are doing comedy, their opponents are just standing and waiting for their comedy to be over. This felt so stupid. Some of the characters are so annoying like orihime. I found her character very funny and good add on to the main characters but she was totally useless in soul society arc and huecomund arc. It also doesn't help that ichigo is loosing to grimjaw and when when orihime motivates ichigo, he becomes much more stronger and beats the shit out of grimjaw. One part which was very frustrating was that even though ichigo's main priority was to save his friends and family but he was like, ""i cut your hand accidentally but you can cut my hand so that we have a fair fight.""🤦.

Overall, even with all these shounen bullshitery the tybw was soo good that it was worth watching bleach.",AngleThat8380,2,0,0.4

496,"As someone who can't stand wish fulfillment tropes in anime, wish fulfillment in and of itself isn't a bad thing (or a rant about The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten)",11jjxs5,"As I said in the title, an anime being a wish fulfillment fantasy is probably one of the biggest turnoffs a show can have for me. Something about how pandering it feels just rubs me the wrong way, like the show is trying to get me to like it not by its own merits but rather through a cynical exploitation of its target demographic. That said, I don't hate every single anime, or even most anime, that have some form of wish fulfillment aspect to it. After all, if I did I probably wouldn't like anime at all. The fact of the matter is that part of the appeal of fiction is the escapist aspect of it. Sometimes we just need to disconnect from the real world and enjoy a fantasy of some sort, and sometimes we want to take part in that fantasy ourselves. That's a big draw to a lot of video games too, letting the player make believe that they're the hero of the story. I get it. But there's a point where it goes from being part of the fun to this weird, slightly uncomfortable sense that a show is actively trying to make you live vicariously through its character(s).

Let me be perfectly clear, however: there's a difference between relating to a character and as such getting a sense of wish fulfillment from their story versus a character or story literally designed to appeal to some sort of escapist fantasy. The isekai genre is infamously often guilty of the latter, though there are plenty of examples of works that manage to be more than just escapist power fantasies. Re:Zero and Mushoku Tensei, to offer some popular examples well-liked isekai, both have wish-fulfillment aspects, but manage to rise above being pure wish fulfillment by having genuinely engaging stories and worlds. For an example of the former, if you'll excuse my use of a non-anime example, see the film How to Train Your Dragon. When I was a teenager I related to the main character of that movie hard. I was awkward, didn't fit in with my peers, had a rough relationship with my father, et cetera et cetera. Watching him overcome those thing in the film was so cathartic for me that it's still one of my go-to comfort movies. But that's the thing. Hiccup has characteristics that I can identify with, and as such I could understand how he felt when he succeeded and failed. That's just good character writing. 

The issue in other works is that they skip the character writing part. As so many others before me have pointed out, ""blank slate"" main characters that seemingly deliberately have no real identifiable character traits beyond ""nice guy,"" ""loner,"" or ""average Joe"" are upsettingly common in anime. The intent with most of these characters seems to be to just let the viewer ""fill in"" the relative blank that is the character with themselves and live vicariously through them. The writer uses this as a crutch to sell some outright lazy storytelling. Think about how many isekai have blank slate protagonists. How many romance anime have ""average loner scores the hottest girl in school due to a quirk of fate or random act of kindness"" as their premise? Once again, the premises themselves aren't the issue. Isekai can and have been done well. Average guy and popular hot girl (and vice versa) romances can and have been done well. The issue is when the intent is clearly not to tell an interesting story with the premise but instead sell the viewer a cynical ""This could be YOU"" experience.

Which brings me, after a roundabout fashion, to what drove me to go on this rant: the currently airing anime The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten. Obviously, the title here is the first warning sign of things to come, but I gave the show a try in hopes that it was more than just a bad title, but no. 8 episodes later and it was possibly the first time I had judged a book by its cover and been absolutely, 100% correct. The main character is like unseasoned mashed potatoes. He is the biggest stock light novel protagonist this side of Kirito complete with the loner tendencies, snarky attitude, and that one haircut. This bargain bin Lelouche looking dude is painstakingly, perfectly written to be *just* relatable enough to the audience to make it all the easier to fill in the unwritten nothing that the rest of him in with themselves. The female lead, meanwhile, is the textbook definition of a Mary Sue. She's the hottest, smartest, nicest girl in the grade as well as an excellent cook and housekeeper. Guys want to be with her, girls want to be her. Even her problems, namely her shitty neglectful parents, only serve as an explanation for how she pushed herself to become the perfect girl. Adding further insult to injury is that, outside of Protag-kun's circle of friends, we never get to see her have any meaningful interaction with any of her peers. Hell, it took the bulk of the show's run to even see her outside of her saccharine domestic life with MC-kun in any meaningful capacity. Why? because that's the fantasy the show is trying to sell. Not an engaging romance or interesting character-driven story. It's selling the viewer the fantasy of having a perfect girl who's life pretty much revolves around them attend to their every need. I wanted it to be more than that and it just... isn't.

I mean, look, if you like that sort of thing, you do you. I'd be lying if I said the show didn't turn into a twisted guilty pleasure for me. I'm not made of stone. I admit I smiled in spite of myself when the couple did something genuinely cute and I felt for the girl when she explained her family situation. It's just that it's all done in service to this cynical fantasy the show is trying to sell rather than telling an actual story.

Anyways 6/10 will watch every episode out of sheer spite

499,Higurashi: When They Cry - Anime of the Week,11jiafi,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## Higurashi: When They Cry

Keiichi Maebara has just moved to the quiet little village of Hinamizawa in the summer of 1983, and quickly becomes inseparable friends with schoolmates Rena Ryuuguu, Mion Sonozaki, Satoko Houjou, and Rika Furude. However, darkness lurks underneath the seemingly idyllic life they lead.

As the village prepares for its annual festival, Keiichi learns about the local legends surrounding it. To his horror, he discovers that there have been several murders and disappearances in the village in the recent years, and that they all seem to be connected to the festival and the village's patron god, Oyashiro. Keiichi tries to ask his new friends about these incidents, but they are suspiciously silent and refuse to give him the answers he needs. As more and more bizarre events occur, he wonders just what else his friends might be keeping from him, and if he can even trust them at all.

When madness and paranoia begin taking root in Keiichi's heart, he will stumble straight into the mysteries at work in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, a story that is told across multiple arcs.

Today's Clow Card: ~~[The Dream](https://imgur.com/a/7GG1YQ4)~~

&nbsp;

Question of the Day:

PLOT! Now that the plot is heating up, what are your predictions for the last 6 episodes of the season?

&nbsp;

Comments of the Day:

/u/Nebresto [has finally been broken by this series]():

>[Now her mom is here](#akkotears)[ and she even has angel wings](#akkotears)[ Leave my feels alone, you fiendish show](#akkotears)

/u/LeonKevlar [pointed out Meiling's development so far](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11ig3hy/rewatch_cardcaptor_sakura_rewatch_episode_39/jaxzuke/):

>The only other thing that I would like to note during this episode is how nice Meiling was towards Sakura the entire episode. It was especially sweet of her to support Sakura while sealing The Cloud Card. Yay for character development! <3

&nbsp;

On an important note, no unmarked spoilers! No jokes about events yet to come, and no references to future episodes!

**Reminder that there will be another inter-seasonal break on the 12th and 13th, with an end of arc discussion thread on the 12th.**

**Clow Card Fortune Book**

**Today's card:**

**[THE DREAM](https://imgur.com/a/7GG1YQ4)**

A chance to get to know oneself. Development period of the subconscious.

**Playing Card when Substituted:** 2 of Hearts

**Card’s Message:**

Your so-called sixth sense is good, and you can obtain important messages from your premonitions / precognitive dreams. Or, there’s a suggestion to regain the importance of having a dream, to regain some room in your heart.

**Card’s Warning:**

Mail a letter or give a phone call to a friend which you haven’t talked to in a long time. Is there a clue to self-recognition...?

&nbsp;

**Questions of the Day, courtesy of u/chilidirigible:**

1) Delta has been the *Macross* TV series with the least usage of gratuitous nudity. Do you prefer that, or has idol-music-culture purification gone too far when it sanitizes a mecha series?  

2) Exactly when would have been a good time to tell Hayate *that*? Is there ever a good time?

505,Anime with good fight finisher setups?,11j9nfs,"So I got an itch to watch a few anime (or scenes) where there is a setup for a crazy finisher that is sprinkled into the entire sequence.  

One example I have is the [Chifuyu vs soldier fight from Infinite Stratos](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wxFPERVsQfk)

There is also a scene in Fate Stay Night that is close, but ended up a little flat.  Still cool though.  I think Fate Zero had a bunch.

506,"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [March 5th, 2023]",11j7qys,"Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2023 season (like **Kubo-san won't let me be Invisible!** or **Spy Classroom**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Mairimashita! Iruma-kun Season 3**).

With regards to Fall 2022 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **Bocchi the Rock!** or **Mob Psycho 100 III**) if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

# SUMMARY OF WEEK 8:

**CHARACTER POPULARITY**

|PLACE|CHARACTER|VOTES TOTAL|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**FIRST**|Kagura|55|
|**SECOND**|Gintoki|54|
|**THIRD**|Katsura|30|
|**FOURTH**|Okita|20|
|**FIFTH**|Hijikata|18|
|**SIXTH**|Otae|17|
|**SEVENTH**|Shinpachi|15|
|**EIGHT**|Madao|14|
|**NINTH**|Elizabeth|6|
|**TENTH**|Sakamoto & Kondo|5|

* Okita jumped from 5th place to 4th place and his assassination attempt on Hijikata made Hijikata fell on 5th place.
* Otae fell to 6th place and Shinpachi fell to 7th place which isn’t as bad as Madao who fell from 6th place to 8th place.
* Also surprisingly Elizabeth got 4 votes and jumped to 9th place leaving such strong characters as Sakamoto and Kondo behind. Having hairy legs sure has its benefits.

**QUESTIONS FOR YOU - WEEK 8:**

To summarize questions 1-4 i must say your reception of Benizakura arc was that it was pretty decent arc and you liked it. I’m really glad for that. Now about question 5.

>Who is your favourite Kiheitai member? Nizou, Banzai, Makoto or Takechi? (From what i saw I liked Makoto even more than on first watch.)

Majority vouched for Makoto, but there were a few interesting remarks that Banzai seems to you like interesting character but you didn’t see him in action at all.

1. Which side character centered episode of this batch is your favourite? (Yamazaki EP62, Zenzo EP63, Katsura EP64)",Shocketheth,121,53,0.96
508,Anime where a character fights another character but they were lovers in past life,11j78rh,"All I can remember is that both characters are presently male and both were heroes and lovers in their past lives who met tragic demise, one being female. Was it seven deadly sins or something else?",lincompoopy,8,1,0.54
509,can someone give a spoiler-free review of aot's latest episode,11j6ks5,"What does everyone think of the latest episode of attack on titan? Could someone give me an idea of how it is being rated by the anime community in general...along with ur own opinion on it.

I would request u all to not discuss the events of the show as this is meant to be a spoiler free discussion. 

Thanks in advance",Vongola___Decimo,17,0,0.38
510,How do you define romance. What is your favorite and least favorite types of romance?,11j5d5b,"Romance, as I have come to learn, is, or rather was, a word not always tied to the concept of love nor tied to a budding relationship between two people who fancy each other. Romance, as it was in the 17th century, was chivalric: a knight would go an a quest to save the world and in the process of saving the world, also saves a damsel in distress.

You can think of this like the Mario games. Mario goes on an adventure to save Peach from Bowser, thereby saving the world, but the actual focus on the relationship between Mario and Peach, and how they love each other, is not really present. Mario may love Peach, and he may be serving a duty to save her and to save the world, but we barely see them interact until the very end when Mario beats Bowser.

On the other hand, and I am very much probably skipping multiple generations of the history of romance, contemporary romance as we know it is very much different in literature, in fiction, and in anime. There are multiple levels of contemporary romance in and of itself, but when I think of romance in fiction and the types of romance I usually read and watch, I think of generally two people, and how their love and bond for each other grows over time, where we are the spectators seeing their relationship grow from nothing to gradually and eventually bloom into something special. This type of romance is not inclusive to just courtship, but it is love that can take many forms, forms that certainly does not mean that the last stage of romance is marriage, and that romance can be extended after marriage, and even without the possibility of marriage ever taking place. Such examples I have encountered with this in anime include Darling in the Franxx, A Silent Voice, Your Lie in April, WorldEnd.

As I have noticed, anime, as a medium, enables romance to take many forms, some chivalric, some erotic, some BL/GL, some fantasy-infused, ... and some straight up wacky. There are some I really like, like the ones I described above, and others which I tend to not like. Usually the harems or erotica romances are fun to watch, but judging them as good romances, the character's relationships are most often superficial and hyper sexually driven, which I guess is what I bargained for when I was watching them.

But anyways, I'd like to know how you would describe what romance means to you, maybe within the context of anime, but it certainly can be what it means to you in general. And also I guess what are your favorite types of romances and least favorite types of romance are since romance is a huge spectrum. There are probably a few you really like, and a few that you roll your eyes when watching.",shenridurb,26,6,0.67

513,/r/anime Awards 2022 Extra Awards Results!,11j3l3i,"Time for the most important part of the r/anime awards 2022, the ones you have all been waiting for, you wanna know who said the line better? Who made better noises? WHO ACTUALLY DESERVED TO WIN IN THE AWARDS????? That all is answered here, in the extra awards!

[](#dancewithit) [](#dancewithit) [](#dancewithit)

##Best Girl

What is more important than a seasonal waifu? Remember when we cared about No Game No Life's Jibril enough to have her get the #1 seed in our best girl contest? Now half of you don't even know who she is! Let's see who are our favorite 2022 girls that will probably be forgotten in a few years!

1. [Chisato Nishikigi](https://anilist.co/character/260329) (Lycoris Recoil)
2. [Hitori Gotou](https://anilist.co/character/257562) (Bocchi the Rock!)
3. [Power](https://anilist.co/character/137079) (Chainsaw Man)

Chisato won the voice actor jury award but you bet this is the real prize. No surprises here, Bocchi would die as soon as Chisato tried talking to her and we all know Power is not really a fan of guns ~~Maybe, wanted to make a Gun Devil joke here but I don't remember Power's thoughts on it.~~

##Best Boy

Where the women at?

...

Ok well, I know there are a couple out there, although looking at these results I am not sure they even voted here.

1. [Kongming Zhuge](https://anilist.co/character/256378) (Paripi Koumei) 
2. [Shigeo Kageyama](https://anilist.co/character/89616) (Mob Psycho 100 III)
3. [Bojji](https://anilist.co/character/209532) (Ousama Ranking)

Or maybe they did actually vote? Bojji and Mob, two cute guys with great stories, Mob finally reaching the conclusion of his own arc. But the winner? The winner is the hot guy that to be fair did a lot for Eiko but kinda disappeared as the show went on... oh well. Not the worst result.

[](#listen)

##Best Parent

Not a lot of these in anime, time to celebrate those that actually exist!

1. [Hiling](https://anilist.co/character/231129) (Ousama Ranking)
2. [Loid Forger](https://anilist.co/character/138101) (Spy×Family)
3. [Serufu's Mother](https://anilist.co/character/288953) (Do It Yourself!!)

Wow, really not a lot when an unnamed character gets 3rd place. Loid... I guess he is not a *bad* parent but I feel he is here more for being likable than being a good parent. First place tho, Queen Hiling is one that definitely deserves this award, good job on the voting here.

##Best Sibling

As a single child I have always been jealous of people with siblings, their relationships always seem pretty fun, let's see the best ones of the year.

1. [Seika Ijichi](https://anilist.co/character/289054) (Bocchi the Rock!)
2. [Futari Gotou](https://anilist.co/character/289059) (Bocchi the Rock!) 
3. [Ritsu Kageyama](https://anilist.co/character/89618) (Mob Psycho 100 III)

Yep, cute/fun relationships all around. Bocchi takes the first two places with a very cool and caring older sister and a pretty cute and funny little sister. Mob's brother gets third place, another pretty cool guy with some nice development throughout the seasons.

##Best Animal

Only actual animals allowed here. Chainsaw Man fans, you can stop barking.

1. [Meat](https://anilist.co/character/288962) (Do It Yourself!!) 
2. [Kururun](https://anilist.co/character/201329) (Tropical-Rouge! Precure) 
3. [Meinya](https://anilist.co/character/199683) (Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul)

Of course, the winner is the coolest pig you'll ever see, he is able to survive a house that terrorizes him during every single meal, he is the best! Second place goes to the cutest seal, mouse, fairy thing you'll ever see. Some of the most memorable Tropicure moments for me include him, never gonna forget him getting brutally murdered by worst girl... And lastly, the MiA little thing, yeah, it was there I guess.

##Best Ship

So many good romance anime this year, very excited to see which couple/ship we liked the most!

1. [Chisato Nishikigi x Takina Inoue](https://i.imgur.com/SpFAMT5.jpeg) ([Lycoris Recoil](https://anilist.co/anime/143270)) 
2. [Aoi x Eve](https://i.imgur.com/Z4t8HWw.jpeg) ([BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls' Story](https://anilist.co/anime/140830)) 
3. [Claudine x Maya](https://i.imgur.com/9InCAQb.png) ([Shoujo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Movie](https://anilist.co/anime/113024))

Damn, some pretty interesting romance anime here, I guess the Revue movie is all about the girls relationships with their partners? Anyway, to no one's surprise r/anime likes gay girls. In first place we have the two badass secret agents that are totally married according to people online. In second place a personal favorite with two badass (Yes, Aoi is badass ty) golfers that will defeat anyone that get in their way, they kissed so they good. And in third place we got the two badass stage girl at the very top of their class, they may be at each other's throats all the time but that just makes the relationship better.


##Best Fight

Time for the hype, what most people care about in anime, best fight scenes! [](#dekuhype)

1. [Claudine vs Maya](https://i.imgur.com/ETdXUfE.png) ([Shoujo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Movie](https://anilist.co/anime/113024)) 
2. [Bojji vs Bosse](https://i.imgur.com/JQX702G.jpeg) ([Ousama Ranking](https://anilist.co/anime/113717)) 
3. [Hoshimi Junna V Daiba Nana](https://i.imgur.com/DbKIL3N.png) ([Shoujo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Movie](https://anilist.co/anime/113024))

Best fight goes to... the third best ship, nice. Considered the centerpiece of the Revue Starlight movie with so much effort put into it, it is no surprise to see it first, longest revue with all sorts of back-and-forths, really recommend checking it out. Second place, David vs Goliat, some impressive visuals as well, the culmination of Ousama Ranking, good 2nd place. [And in third we got 𝓰𝓪𝓸.](https://i.imgur.com/KFNgZkR.gif)

##Best Noises

Best VA 2.0, I am probably wrong but it feels this only really started being a thing after Kumiko, lets see who needs a noises compilation this time. 

1. [Yuuko Yoshida](https://streamable.com/ebld2e) ([The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2](https://anilist.co/anime/123330)) 
2. [Hitori Gotou](https://streamable.com/ctrzgl) ([Bocchi the Rock!](https://anilist.co/anime/130003)) 
3. [Faputa](https://streamable.com/k0f20x) ([Made in Abyss: Dawn of the Deep Soul](https://anilist.co/anime/114745))

Our lovely Shadow Mistress Yuko wins it! Yeah, when I think of Shamiko I think of her making noises or saying her catchphrase, it checks out. Bocchi gets second place, the Bocchi glitching noise will be remembered for a good while after all. [](#bocchitheshock)  
And we finish it off with Faputa sosu. Another very demanding voice acting role sosu. Good job to all the VAs here sosu.

##Best Quote

Different reasons for lines to be the best of the year, can be their memeability as with ""People Die If They Are Killed"", maybe their impact as the only moment people remember from Maoyuu, [the ""I am human"" or Serf's Speech](https://i.imgur.com/x9AEgZJ.png) or maybe it  is because of its voice acting just like in [that one Inobato scene you are already thinking about.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNPK6DzQCzY) Let's see what this year's are all about.

1. [""I'll kill you, in golf""](https://streamable.com/voc47u) - [Eve](https://anilist.co/character/253820) (BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls' Story) 
2. [""For heroes, there are trials! For saints, there are temptations! For me… \[early\] there is a devil., \[climax\] there is you!""](https://streamable.com/v530ub) - [Claudine Saijou](https://anilist.co/character/126665) & [Maya Tendou](https://anilist.co/character/126666) (Shoujo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Movie) 
3. [""Another day, another chance to go moe moe kyun!""](https://streamable.com/si7kss) - [Ranko Mannen](https://anilist.co/character/280139) (Akiba Maid War)

Memeability wins! A sentence that perfectly encompasses the ridiculousness of Birdie Wing, Eve threatening to kill someone... in golf. Amazing. Claudine and Maya get their third shout out in the extra awards, a single revue is all it takes, this quote shows part of the the back-and-forth mentioned in Best Fight, starting the revue as rivals, reaching the climax finding their role in each other's play. Lastly we get a quote from the ED song of Akiba Maid War, this song actually changes throughout the show but this just like in Birdie Wing, this one sentence shows the different sides of the show, a song with a very serious tone talking about doing the ""moe moe kyun""

##Best Insert Song

Lots of bangers this year, let's see which Cyberpunk song you chose.

1. [Guitar, Loneliness, and the Blue Planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p010N38zFrA) ([Bocchi the Rock!](https://anilist.co/anime/130003)) 
2. [I Really Want to Stay at Your House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMY1uzSC1E) ([Cyberpunk: Edgerunners](https://anilist.co/anime/120377)) 
3. [Dreamer](https://open.spotify.com/track/7yKbjz9hzbUY6zmIJ8nDDL?si=5fc13e382096492b) ([Paripi Koumei](https://anilist.co/anime/141774))

Well damn, Cyberpunk didn't win. 1st place goes to Bocchi, I don't really have a lot to say here, it is a cool song, used in episode 5 and episode 8 with Bocchi finally getting some confidence... for a bit. I am one of them normies tho, and second place is what really gets me. The use of ""I Really Want to Stay at Your House"" in the last episode of Cyberpunk Edgerunners really got me, I listen to this song a lot. Dreamer from Paripi Koumei, another pretty great song, used in the final ""battle"" to great effect, I had forgotten about it until I went to grab it for this but yeah, deserved third place.

##Best Title Drop 

[Insert CinemaSins meme]

1. [""Bocchi the Rock""](https://streamable.com/7038wt) - [Nijika Ijichi](https://anilist.co/character/261674) 
2. [""Do It Yourself""](https://streamable.com/r4frmz) - [Serufu Yua](https://anilist.co/character/215032) 
3. [""Ultra Romantic""](https://streamable.com/gaiduw) – [Yuu Ishigami](https://anilist.co/character/121102), [Kaguya Shinomiya](https://anilist.co/character/120649) & [Narrator](https://anilist.co/character/36309)

Damn, kinda disappointed with these results myself ngl, I mean, the Bocchi one was funny but idk I still don't get it, the sentence makes no sense. On ther other hand we got the second place which of course is a lot easier to use but Serufu being so proud with her ""Yua Serufu/Yourself"" joke was just hilarious every single time. And in third we got the Kaguya characters going ""Oh my god that's so Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic-""... ok no, they just say ""Ultra Romantic"", cost me a bit to find this one to clip it as I didn't even remember it, it is not bad.

##Biggest Surprise

Best part of watching seasonals, grabbing shows with no real expectations and being surprised with what could very well end up being a modern classic, let's see what did that this year.

1. [Bocchi the Rock!](https://anilist.co/anime/130003) 
2. [Lycoris Recoil](https://anilist.co/anime/143270) 
3. [BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls' Story](https://anilist.co/anime/140830)

Calling the first two ""surprises"" when they are so popular feels weird but yeah, I don't think they were mentioned very much before their first episode aired. They make me remember a discussion I had about Re:Zero, I swear Re:Zero was a surprise, you struggle to find mentions of it before it aired but it is strange with how almost mainstream it is nowadays. Anyway, three very good shows, Bocchi showing what a good anime adaptation can accomplish and Lycoris and Birdie Wing showing original anime are still going strong.

##Most Snubbed

\#BirdieWingAOTY

1. [Dance Dance Danseur](https://anilist.co/anime/132171) 
2. [BIRDIE WING: Golf Girls' Story](https://anilist.co/anime/140830) 
3. [Healer Girl](https://anilist.co/anime/133412)

Ok fair, DDD was very good and it honestly felt like what the r/anime jury would enjoy, pretty surprising to see that it didn't even get a nomination. Happy to see my pick in 2nd, very enjoyable anime and also not nominations, feels like a harder seel compared to DDD, though. And Healer Girl, not sure I agree with that one, it got a nomination in cinematography and I feel that's fair, don't know where else I'd have had it, the story wasn't too strong imo.

##Biggest Trainwreck 

Trainwrecks can be enjoyable, always fun to have a ""so bad it is good"" show, let's see if these are enjoyable or not.

1. [Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It r=1-sinθ](https://anilist.co/anime/125124) 
2. [The Devil is a Part-Timer! Season 2](https://anilist.co/anime/130592)
3. [Lycoris Recoil - Episode 4](https://i.imgur.com/gBsRdI5.jpeg)

I am gonna say these are not enjoyable, that Rikekoi ending was just yikes. The Devil is a Part Timer is the first show in these lists I didn't watch, let me know why it is considered a trainwreck.   
And Lycoris [](#smugpoint)

##Best Dub

And now I get exposed, I don't watch English dubs, only dubs I watch are Spanish ones and in theaters because subs in theaters feel weird, don't ask why. Anyway...

1. [Cyberpunk: Edgerunners](https://anilist.co/anime/120377)
2. [My Dress-Up Darling](https://anilist.co/anime/132405)
3. [86: Eighty Six Part 2](https://anilist.co/anime/131586)

Let me know what you like about these dubs, Cyberpunk having a good dub just makes sense, it makes me think, shouldn't RWBY be here? My Dress Up Darling is an interesting one, Marin's JP VA did a very good job with it but it does seem like a role dubbed could have fun with. 

##Best Dub VA in Role 

And as expected, got nothing to say here, sorry.

1. [Zach Aguilar as David Martinez](https://anilist.co/staff/129181) (Cyberpunk Edgerunners) 
2. [Billy Kametzas Shinei Nouzen](https://anilist.co/staff/129182) (86: Eighty Six Part 2)

Well, you can't blame me as we only got two  nominations here, seems people really liked the 86 dub tho, maybe we should have like dub only rewatches or something to encourage people to watch dubs.

516,Armored Hunter Mellowlink Rewatch - Interest Thread,11j0h7x,"***”As expected, his revenge has started.”***

---

Greetings, everyone! I am here to gauge whether there is sufficient interest in a Rewatch of Takeyuki Kanda and Ryosuke Takahashi’s, *Armor Hunter Mellowlink*, an OVA set in the fictional universe of the *Armored Trooper Votoms* franchise. This Rewatch would begin on the 20th of March, and end on April 1st with an Overall Series Discussion, with threads going up daily at 2:00pm UTC (10:00am EST | 7:00am PST). If you’d like to see such a thing take place, do voice your interest in the comments, and feel free to ask me any questions pertaining to the Rewatch or the show itself!

**Why watch it?**

* Armor Hunter Mellowlink is an unorthodox mecha series whose titular character does not pilot one of the franchise’s iconic mechs, but rather faces off against them as a lone infantryman, using his wits and tactical know-how to outmaneuver, trap, or outsmart his opponents. This sort of approach to a mecha narrative remains novel and is rarely employed in other mecha series, making this series’ emphasis on it all the more unique.

* The show is a tale of revenge quite simply told, and remains fresh by employing an episodic structure that takes us far and wide through the series’ established setting at a brisk pace before shifting into a more serialized format that keeps its variety of locales, all the while introducing scenarios and set-pieces that are distinct, frequently clever, and always cinematic.

* Armor Hunter Mellowlink can serve as an approachable entry point into the larger *Armor Trooper Votoms*, requiring no prior knowledge of the franchise, expressing the breadth of the franchise’s gritty sci-fi setting, and keeping a narrow scale that preserves elements for reveal in other, earlier entries. 

* The show was the work of many outstanding and venerated talent, namely real robot pioneers Takeyuki Kanda and Ryosuke Takahashi, who take on directing and lead writing responsibilities respectively. Some of the show’s illustrious staff members are still active today, such as *Shinichiro Watanabe*, *Shinji Takamisu*, and *Takashi Imanichi*.

---

**How do I watch it?**

*Armor Hunter Mellowlink* is sadly unavailable in English in any official capacity, and so unofficial means must be employed to enjoy it.

529,Shows that had a remake that turned out better?,11ipv26,Could be any genre. Film or TV. Just wondering if there are any notable shows that had a remake that turned out to be noticeably better than what was originally had and not just in terms of animation.,ComprehensiveYam4534,50,14,0.85
530,Give me your best Competent MC anime recommendations,11ilt4g,"I'm about to blow a casket if I watch one more show featuring an MC that's dumb as a bucket of bolts, weak as dirt, or oblivious to everything that goes on around them. 

Having entire storylines and successes/failures be purely based on luck and coincidence is getting boring. And watching romance shows with excessive tsundere shit and people not able to figure out their feelings is frustrating.

I'd love to watch more shows with characters like Kiyotaka Ayanokoji from Classroom of the Elite. Moriarty from Yuukoku no Moriarty. Or LeLouch from Code Geass. Light or Kira from Death Note, and so on.

They don't have to be ""OP"" necessarily, though it makes sense that just comes with the territory of actually being competent.

At this point I don't even care about the genre or ratings. I'll give anything a shot. I'm just tired of 90% of the anime revolving around luck and coincidence, power of friendship and feelings, instead of actual brain power or physical competence.  

I've watched hundreds of anime, so it's a bit much for me to list everything I've already seen, but even if I get a single new show to watch I'd be happy.

533,[Rewatch] The Ancient Magus' Bride - Episode 4,11ikcfj,"Episode 4: *Everything must have a beginning*

[← Previous Episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11hm8f0/rewatch_the_ancient_magus_bride_episode_3/) | [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/10t22wg/the_ancient_magus_bride_rewatch_announcement_and/)| [Next Episode →](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11jl5wc/rewatch_the_ancient_magus_bride_episode_5/)

**Fae Facts:**

Cats having multiple lives is a common myth in many areas, although the exact number varies from culture to culture. It's mentioned in various sources in english literature, from the proverb  ‘A cat has nine lives. For three he plays, for three he strays and for the last three he stays.’ to a mention in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.

**Discussion Topics:**

What do you think the sorcerers wanted with the corruption?

Great love can be as dangerous as great hate. Love can lead to reckless actions without care for others, as well as jealousy.

**Manga/BTS:**

\[Chapter 4-5\]>!In the manga, Elias describes the world as a computer system, and magi as the admins that can change the rules of the world. Sorcerers on the other hand are like hackers.!<

**Selected Favourite Quotes and Images from Last Episode:**

**Quotes**""The living should not envy the dead""

""We live our lives to the fullest, so that we're never left with regrets.""

“What is given to us is the same as what is given to all who live on  this planet. Whether that’s the joy or pain of living, or the sadness or  loneliness of dying.”

**Discussion Topics For Episode 5:**

\[Question 1\]>!Truth and honesty are usually depicted as being vital to fae, but Chise shows a lack of care to the honesty of others. Why?!<

\[Question 2\]>!Do you think Matthew and Mina deserve their happy ending, after the suffering they caused ? !<",blackninjakitty,44,65,0.95
534,"Anyone else disappointed by the Demon Slayer ""movie""?",11iivft,"I understand it was known that there'd be a recap of information, but I did not expect it to be lazy.


1. They didn't upscale for IMAX or Dolby
2. Front audio only + sides of screen chopped off
3. Credits multiple times
4. Commercial break transitions not cut out
5. Didn't cut S2 episodes down at all
6. Played scenes twice (end of S2 and start of S3) 


Just not what I expected from Ufotable. Especially with their ""thank you tour"" to their fans, you'd expect something a fan couldn't do with Windows Movie Maker. You could remake the movie on your phone. Just source the episodes and just merge in a video editing app. 


I do love supporting anime cinema. I paid to watch One Piece Red and other movies from shows I don't watch just because I think supporting the industry is good. I want my favorite anime to want to make movies as well. But this wasn't something I feel like deserves support. 


Maybe for those that watch exclusively on lower end audiovisual set ups this is good? Ufotable didn't really do anything to make this an amazing cinema experience though.

(season 1 spoilers),11iimxx,"I thought season 1 was pretty bad rating it 3/10 especially the lack of information they give to the MC, how dense the MC is but most of all that the ""bad guys"" get to just walk away at the end(really wanted to see them get the crap beaten out of them).
So given all that is it worth watching the second season or is it just going to be more of the same as the first season.
