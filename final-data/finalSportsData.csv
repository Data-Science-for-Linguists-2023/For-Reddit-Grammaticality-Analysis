**Division**: AFC East

**Record**: 7-10

**TL:DWR Summary**: Before the season started, many Jets fans had zeroed in on the 7-9 win range for the 2023 Jets as an acceptable next step in their rebuild, myself included. Yet somehow, falling within that win range lead to one of the more painful seasons in the last decade. The Jets were 7-4 entering the month of December, primed to end the leagues longest current playoff drought, but instead lost a whopping 6 straight games to shut the door on the playoffs. This season felt like a season os missed opportunities, with a number of games being within arms length of a win but the Jets squandering it through a variety of ways. Games like both Patriots matchups, the Vikings and Lions matchups, and others all felt incredibly winnable with even myself at the helm. Ultimately this is a team that is held back by something the Jets have been searching for since 1970, a quarterback. Outside of that position, the roster is largely well constructed and *if* they manage to get even a league average QB in the offseason, their playoffs odds increase exponentially. While a painful season overall, the Jets enjoyed quite a few stellar individual seasons, with Sauce Gardener being named the first rookie CB to the All Pro team since Ronnie Lott (and a clear choice for DROY, Garrett Wilson breaking the Jets single season rookie WR yard record (another top candidate for OROY, Quinnen Williams receiving All Pro nods, AVT dominating all ends of the trenches, DJ Reed being a lockdown corner next to Gardener, Breece Hall looking like an All Pro caliber RB, and others.

**2022 Offseason:**

**Major FA Signings:**

**Laken Tomlinson, G. - 3 years, $40 million:** I have no idea what happened to Laken Tomlinson, but he went from a respected above average guard to arguably the worst linemen on the Jets offensive line. Prior to the Jets, he was one of the top guards on the market, hadn't missed a single snap in 3 years, played under MLF, and ranked 13th out of 82 guards in 2021 per PFF. This season he graded out at a 56 and was ranked 58th out of 78 qualified guards. I'm genuinely not well versed enough in the workings of an offensive line, so I wish I could tell you why he was struggled but I can't, all I know is he was wildly disappointing for a FA acquisition I thought would be relatively safe.

**DJ Reed, CB - 3 years, $33 million:** For an opposite end of the spectrum compared to Laken Tomlinson, DJ Reed might go down as one of the best Jets FA acquisitions ever. Reed is only 26, but was ranked 25th out of 118 qualified CB's and graded out to a 72.5. Reed totaled career highs in tackles (80), solo tackles (63) and passes defensed (12), while adding one interception and playing all 17 games in 2022, per Rotowire. Reed often times found himself shadowing top WR's as well, as the Jets scheme had Gardener and Reed moving around occasionally. He was a pleasure to watch alongside Gardener, and the Jets have suddenly found themselves a formidable sidekick to Sauce Gardener for the next few years.

**Braxton Berrios, WR/Do it all Utility - 2 years, $12 million:** Someone in the Jets sub said it best, Berrios was better when he was playing for his career. He turned in a rather disappointing season

**Joe Flacco, QB - 1 year, $3 million:** Joe Flacco was fine at this point for what he is. I feel like that will rile up my fellow Jets fans, but he is a 37 year old statue who's best playing days ended like 5 years ago. Leading the Jets to 1-2 versus Baltimore, Cleveland, and Cincy is fine for me, and the Cleveland game was especially fun to watch as the Jets lead an incredible comeback to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. He did have a pretty disastrous single snap versus the Bills where he came in and immediately fumbled the ball, for what its worth. In all he looked pretty miserable to be here, so I hope he hangs it up and gets to have fun with his family or whatever Joe Flacco does in his free time.

**Greg Zuerlein - 1 year, $2.7 million:** The Jets had used 7 kickers since 2019, a position that Joe Douglas had mysteriously neglected since his tenure began in NY, but fortunately Zuerlein turned in a solid season and showcased consistency at a position that the Jets had been missing since Jason Myers. He was 30 for 37 on the year with a long of 60 yards, which broke a Jet record, so the ""Leg"" has still very much got it. He'll be 36 next season so he's not a long term solution, but for the next year or two he should hopefully offer consistency.

2022 NFL Draft:

**Round 1, Pick 4 - Ahmad ""Sauce"" Gardener:** Could very well go down as one of the best Jets draft picks ever, Gardener has already established himself as one of the best cornerbacks in all of football in his rookie season, at the ripe age of just 22. He has a unique combined of size/length at 6'3"", along with speed and incredible technique. He joins Ronnie Lott as the last rookie CB to make the first team All-Pro, he graded out as PFF's highest ranked CB, he's all but secured the DROY, and he finished the 2022 season with 75 tackles (51 solo), two interceptions and a league-high 20 passes defensed. He certainly gets away with a bit of handsy play, if we're being totally objective about it, but so do the best CB's in the league, and he does a good job at toeing the line and not going too far, despite this sub forcing the PI merchant narrative after the Broncos game.

**Round 1, Pick 11 - Garrett Wilson**: Another absolutely incredible selection, Wilson broke the Jets single season rookie receiving yards record, and became the first Jets WR with 1000 yards in a season since Eric Decker and Brandon Marshall in 2015 (!!!!!). Wilson moves in such a smooth way, and also does an great job at breaking tackles/taking big hits for a guy who isn't all that massive. He had some great performances this season as well, putting up 162 yards versus the Vikings for example (a game in which he probably has over 200 if Mike White hits that throw down the sideline in the 4th quarter), or scoring 2 huge touchdowns versus the Browns, one of which the game winner. I know this gets said with WR's all the time, so I'll sound like a broken record, but what he did with the worst QB room in the entire league is special to no end. He had a guy who shouldn't even be in the NFL throwing to him for half the season, the corpse of Joe Flacco, and Mike White (I don't have a little quip about him sorry), and if he a Patrick Mahomes, a Josh Allen, Joe Burrow, etc. he would have had 1500 yards easily. He found himself open on so many occasions (in which Zach Wilson didn't see him) so there were a lot of yards left on the table. In all he has shown elite WR ability in just his first year and if he gets a real QB, I genuinely believe he can ascend to a Top 10/5 guy in the league.

**Round 1, Pick 26- Jermaine Johnson II**: A excellent trade up to get a player looking forward to playing with us. He has proven to be a solid edge with a lot of great potential with this D-line in the future. Also very fast for an edge rusher with a few successful chase downs on qbs.

**2023 Offseason (so far)**

**The Good Stuff (FA Signings)**

**WR Allen Lazard 4 year 44 million**: A great replacement for Berrios. I do think we overpaid him a by a lot, but would love to see him and Rodgers together balling out in Gotham Green.

**G Wes Schweitzer 2 year 5 million**: Another great replacement for the departing Nate Herbig. Very affordable and would love to see him protect our future QB.

**The Bad Stuff (FA Departures)**

**WR Braxton Berrios > Miami Dolphins**

**G Dan Feeney > Miami Dolphins**

**QB Mike White > Miami Dolphins ( Gonna miss him the most : ( )**

**WR Jeff Smith > New York Giants**

**G** **Nate Herbig > Pittsburgh Steelers**

**DE Nathan Shepherd > New Orleans Saints**

**DT Sheldon Rankins > Houston Texans**

**RB James Robinson > New England Patriots**

**Conclusion**

It's safe to say that this year had its ups and downs. Seeing our rookies thrive was by far my favorite though. 2 top 10 picks became OROY and DROY giving us a Jets Sweep at the NFL Honors. Our biggest downfall had to be injuries, as we lost a lot of key parts to our O-line as well as Breece Hall who tore his ACL Week 7 at Denver. I do believe that because of these injuries (as well as Zach Wilson just being ass) really forced us out of playoff contention. The future is looking bright though for these Jets, and I am excited to see what happens in this next upcoming season. J! E! T! S! JETS! JETS! JETS!

2,"[OC] The analysis you didn’t think you needed, and you were probably right: The GOAT at every height and weight (5 lb. increments).",11vlcq6,"**Eric Bieniemy** is the GOAT. **Chris Collinsworth** is the GOAT. **Ed “To Tall” Jones** is the GOAT. **Mike Glennon** is the GOAT. **Cameron Heyward** is the GOAT. **Russell Wilson** is the GOAT. **Jordan Mailata** is the GOAT.

In this edition of off-season fiddle-faddle, I’m exploring the GOAT at every height and weight combination. Each one of the players above are the greatest player since the merger at their specific height and weight. There are only 3 players who are 5’7’’ 205-209 lbs., but Eric Bienemey is the best of them (the other two were RBs who played a combined 10 career games). At another weird combination 6’5’’ and only 190-194 lbs, Chris Collinswirth is the king, beating out three other players: an awkwardly tall DB named Isaac Booth, a punter and a QB named Cliff Olander who backed up Dan Fouts for three years in the late ‘70s. That late ‘70s Chargers team, by the way, had two GOATs in the QB room with Dan Fouts being the 6’3’’ 200-204 lb. GOAT.

There are 436 GOATs across the \~20,000 players in the NFL since the 1970. “*GOAT*” really isn’t an accurate term since it implies “All Time” and I’m looking at players since the merger. But “*GSTM*” just doesn’t have a ring to it, so in the interest of narrative building and simplicity I’m going with the commonly used term of *GOAT*, but know that this analysis is really the “Greatest Since The Merger”.

AV ([Approximate Value](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/about/approximate_value.htm)) is the metric I used to determine who the GOAT is. It’s flawed…we know. Every stat is flawed. But it’s the easiest stat to pull for something like this and directionally it’s a solid stat to compare across positions. Also, these are the *listed* heights and weights in Pro Football Reference. I’m sure some reported weights are not what a player actually weighs (William Perry at 325 lbs. for example), but I can’t do anything about that.

I started at the merger because I want to maintain positional integrity somewhat. Football players were funny sizes a long time ago. I don’t want the GOAT 5’10’’ 205-pound player to be some guard named Adolph Bieberstein from the leather helmet days. Even going back to 1970 will have some of these issues but to a lesser degree. It wasn’t uncommon to have offensive linemen in the ‘70s with a height and weight of some linebackers today.

So here is the data you’ve been *weighting* for (dad joke). The GOATs at every height and weight since the merger. The data is color coded by position, to me this is where it gets interesting…seeing how/where the GOATs begin to change by position as the height and weight changes. The second chart shows the counts in a heatmap-ish grid allowing for you to see where the biggest concentrations of players are by viewing the volume through both dimensions at the same time.

# The height and weight GOATS

Because I don’t have great data organization skills, this was a process in which I ran 436 individual Stathead queries (don’t judge…this is how I relax, it’s zen to me). The updates to the data were also extremely manual, so there could be errors. Let me know if you see a player color coded at the wrong position.

Here is the height and weight distribution of the nearly 20,000 players who have stepped on the field since 1970.

# Distribution of players across height and weight

https://preview.redd.it/fren7nnx5poa1.png?width=1097&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=67bfc7433d0b54962268e7437eeb4d69c72919a5

Also, after looking at this information for a while, the analysis begs for similar heat map views by position, as well as exploring changes over time. If there is enough interest, I’ll work on getting the data aggregated in a way that allows me to peel that layer of the onion as well.

You can see (sort of) three distinct dark blobs.

* **Blob 1:** 190 lb. – 210 lb.; 5’10’’ – 6’2’; these are primarily WRs, CBs, and some RBs
* **Blob 2:** 220 lb. – 260 lb.; 6’1’’ – 6’5’’; these are mostly linebackers, but also a smattering of 70’s interior OL when some of them were lighter.
* **Blob 3:** 300 lb. – 320 lb.; 6’3’’ – 6’ 5’’; mostly C, G, and some OT

I also thought it was interesting to see an unnatural spike at 250 lbs. and 300 lbs. This tells me one of two things. 1.) When a player is close to a desirable milestone weight, they change their nutrition/exercise to get to that target weight. But I think it’s more likely to be option two...if a guy is close to 300 or 250, they get a little bump on their listed weight to make them seem bigger than they are.

As an aside, I’d like to introduce *bodygami*, which is similar to [scorigami](https://nflscorigami.com/). Bodygami is when a player enters the league at a height and weight we have never seen before (or at least since the merger). After this year’s draft, we may be able to fill a few of the black squares with some new body types. A couple of candidates are **Dawand Jones** (OT, Ohio St) at 6’8’’ 374 lb., and **Deuce Vaughn** (RB, Kansas St) who is listed at 5’5’’ 179. Neither of those height/weight combinations have played in the NFL since the merger.

That’s it for now. More to come on this, probably.

3,"If Dan Snyder sold the Commanders today, who would immediately become the NFL’s new most hated owner?",11vi6th,"I don’t really know much about the other owners outside of a few like Jerry Jones, Robert Kraft, Jeffrey Lurie, and Woody Johnson.

4,"In The Two Years After His MVP Season, Lamar Jackson Made $3,307,568. The Ravens Failed to Leverage That to Build A More Complete Offensive Roster. Why Does That Narrative Get Lost?",11v7uqn,"According to Sportrac, after being named the NFL's second ever unanimous MVP, Lamar Jackson made $1,535,980 in 2020 and $1,771,588 in 2021. Typically, those numbers, matched with Lamar's talent, would have triggered the sort of ""win now"" roster moves that are often seen to maximize a team's Super Bowl window. And in a time where multiple uber-talented WR1s have moved via trade, it makes the Ravens' decision to stand pat that much more glaring. 

Why doesn't this get talked about more in relation to Lamar's post-MVP success and current contract negotiations? If the Ravens weren't able to leverage Lamar's extremely cheap contract, how can they be trusted to leverage a more expensive but (relatively) team-friendly contract? Given the above context, in a league where windows and careers are short, could there be more justification in asking for the sort of grand guaranteed contract that might not be conducive to building towards a Super Bowl? And to further expand, has the Ravens window closed in such a way that its better to prioritize financial gain over a championship? 

I'm genuinely asking and I'm interested in hearing all answers. I don't personally have a strong opinion. However, to help steer a productive conversation, I'll note that for those of you that argue that Lamar is simply arguing over semantics, you would also have to believe that the organization is doing the same. I understand how escrow bylaws work but I'm more interested in the above questions.",ktime156,855,5674,0.93

6,Syracuse RB Sean Tucker would’ve dominated the Combine,11vv4i8,"Tucker didn’t participate in the combine, I believe for medical reasons. But he just uploaded a video to his Twitter yesterday showing the numbers he could’ve put up:

4.33 laser 40, would’ve been second among RB’s 

28 reps of 225 ( would’ve led RB’s)

41.5 inch Vert ( would’ve led RB’s)

The 40 was no surprise, if you’ve been watching the guy, you’d know he has wheels. But combined with the bench and Vert, those are ridiculous numbers, and he’s probably the most athletic back in this draft class. His pro day is tommorow, not known if he’ll work out there.

The only international buyers I think would have a chance at the Commanders would be an oil states sovereign wealth fund e.g. Abu Dhabi United Group, Qatar Sports Investments, or Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund where each group would have very deep pockets and could probably give out guaranteed contracts without blinking an eye.

Obviously, there are a few exceptions like the Titans & Ravens or the Rams in 2021, but I'm noticing an overall pattern.

29,I did the math to find out who is the most underrated/overrated team in football.,11td1f5,"**TLDR:** I developed a stat called AFAR to determine how under/overrated a team is by media power rankings. The first table in the post shows how teams stack up. [I also made a video going into detail on everything here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhcUA1hZuUM&t)  


**Basis**

Every fan base at one point or another has complained that the national media underrates their team. I was curious which fan bases actually have a point, and which fan bases actually get special treatment. While media bias is hard to quantify, power rankings give us a nice clean variable to work with.

**Methodology**

I went back and found preseason power rankings from five major outlets (ESPN, CBS, NBC, PFF, and NFLcom) over the last 10 years. I entered each and every rating into a database, and then compared each ranking to how that team actually finished the year. For ""final placement"" I just used reverse draft standing order. So the worst record in the NFL I entered as finishing in 32nd place, the Super Bowl Champion I entered as finishing in 1st place.

&#x200B;

Once all of this data was in, I calculated how high or low each team finished on average, in comparison to their preseason ranking. I called this number AFAR... or Average Finish Above Ranking. So a positive AFAR means a team finished that far above their rankings on average, and are thus ""underrated"". Negative AFAR means the exact opposite and therefore ""overrated"".

&#x200B;

**Rankings**

After hours of digging through archived websites, setting up google sheets, and entering data... here are the results:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|Team|AFAR (2012-2022)|
|:-|:-|
|Bills|3.20|
|Dolphins|3.10|
|Titans|2.37|
|Commanders|2.29|
|Vikings|2.06|
|Chiefs|1.76|
|Jets|1.51|
|Panthers|1.41|
|Rams|0.96|
|Bengals|0.96|
|Colts|0.84|
|Seahawks|0.59|
|Browns|0.41|
|Lions|0.10|
|Raiders|\-0.10|
|49ers|\-0.12|
|Eagles|\-0.20|
|Cowboys|\-0.37|
|Buccaneers|\-0.39|
|Cardinals|\-0.43|
|Bears|\-0.73|
|Jaguars|\-0.75|
|Saints|\-1.00|
|Patriots|\-1.06|
|Steelers|\-1.20|
|Chargers|\-1.24|
|Giants|\-1.49|
|Texans|\-1.61|
|Ravens|\-1.71|
|Falcons|\-2.57|
|Broncos|\-2.80|
|Packers|\-4.00|

&#x200B;

**Findings**

I was quite shocked to see the Bills finish as the most underrated team in football, simply based on their recent trend of always being considered a SB contender, yet never making it. But it's important to remember this data spans the last decade... and until recently, the math shows the Bills were criminally underrated. From 2013-2020 the Bills only ended a season with a negative AFAR once. That was in 2016 when they finished -2.75 below their preseason rankings. Every other year they beat media expectations, sometimes by quite a lot.

&#x200B;

I was also surprised to see the Packers as the most ""overrated"" team, and by such a great margin. I immediately assumed their 2013 and 2017 seasons, in which they lost Aaron Rodgers for a significant chunk of time, were to blame. Afterall, of course a team will finish lower than expectations if their MVP caliber QB misses half the season. So out of curiosity I completely removed those Green Bay seasons from the dataset, and the Packers still came in as the 2nd lowest team in AFAR at -2.74... barely avoiding dead last even with special parameters.

**Other Interesting Takeaways**

I could dive into every team that deeply, but the table speaks for itself... if you'd like to do more digging on your own, I'll link to my google sheet with all the math. I did find some other interesting tidbits during my research however.

&#x200B;

Once I had all of this data I realized I had everything I needed to grade each of the 5 outlets on accuracy. So I did the math to see how far each of their individual rankings were off by on average. I was absolutely shocked at how close they all were.

&#x200B;

|Outlet|Average Differential on Rankings|
|:-|:-|
|NFL.com|8.01|
|NBC|8.02|
|CBS|8.04|
|ESPN|8.11|
|PFF|8.63|

Four of the five outlets were literally within a hundredth of each other on overall accuracy. And before you hate on PFF too much, you should know that from 2014-2017 they stopped publishing team power rankings, so their accuracy ranking is working with a smaller sample size.

As a Titans fan I've also always heard the old ""The national media doesn't care about us because we're a small market team"" argument. So I was curious to see if there's any correlation between team market size and AFAR. There wasn't... like at all.Correlation chart: [https://imgur.com/b9Dfhst](https://imgur.com/b9Dfhst)

**Final Thoughts**

Obviously the concept of a team being over or under rated, goes deeper than power rankings, but I still thought this was an interesting case study and would make for some good offseason content.

**Season Review**

In the preseason, the Eagles were listed at around 25:1 odds to win the Super Bowl. Despite being 9-win overachievers in 2021 and adding a slew of talent, their Vegas over/under projection of 9.5 wins was lower than that of the Raiders and Broncos and equal to that of the Colts. And yet, they blew through that expectation and then some, topping the NFC standings in Week 3 and never relinquishing that spot en route to an NFC championship and a near-Super Bowl win.

The offense went from pretty good in 2021 to nuclear in 2022, thanks to a spectacular 3rd season from QB Jalen Hurts, who blew away all expectations and propelled himself into the upper echelon of NFL QBs, finishing 2nd in MVP voting. It wasn’t all Hurts, of course: the trio of A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, and Dallas Goedert formed one of the most talented and well-rounded receiving trios in the NFL, a dominant offensive line headlined by All-Pros Lane Johnson and Jason Kelce formed the backbone for a steady, efficient run game, and Miles Sanders put up the best numbers of his career in his first fully-healthy season.

But it was the defense that arguably made the bigger jump. A solidly-below-average unit in 2021 saw a massive influx of talent in the offseason, morphing into one of the NFL’s most dangerous. The Eagles’ pass rush was the NFL’s most effective by a country mile, as its 70 sacks were a whopping 15 more than the next-best unit, headlined by double-digit sack seasons from Josh Sweat, Brandon Graham, Javon Hargrave, and newcomer Haason Reddick. But it wasn’t the pass rush alone that saw a jump: LBs T.J. Edwards and Kyzir White were solid all-around contributors, while in the secondary, CBs Darius Slay, James Bradberry, and Avonte Maddox teamed with safeties Marcus Epps and Chauncey Gardner-Johnson to form one of the stoutest pass defenses in the NFL.

**Offseason Recap**

**KEY ACQUISITIONS:**

* LB Haason Reddick - The first major domino of the offseason, Reddick was a much-needed shot in the arm for a lackluster pass rush, and for a defense that in general needed playmakers. His 16.0 sacks were tied for 2nd in the NFL, and were the most by an Eagle in 11 years.
* WR A.J. Brown (Trade, TEN) - The Eagles might have been okay with chasing just a complementary WR2 to DeVonta Smith, but when they acquired Brown on draft day, the dynamic of the Eagles’ offense completely changed. The off-field chemistry between Hurts and Brown was well-known, but that translated on-field too, as Brown finished 4th in the NFL in receiving yards (1496) and tied for 3rd in receiving TDs (11).
* S C.J. Gardner-Johnson (Trade, NO) - Acquired just before the season for the shockingly low price tag of two late draft picks, CJGJ was a Swiss Army knife for the Eagles’ secondary, lining up as the deep safety, in the slot, or in the box and making plays no matter where he was. CJGJ tied for the league lead in interceptions despite missing 5 games with a kidney laceration.
* CB James Bradberry - A Giants cap casualty, the Eagles swooped in for Bradberry in May to fill what seemed like the last significant gap - a CB to line up opposite Darius Slay. The 2020 Pro Bowler didn’t disappoint, notching a pick 6 in his first game as an Eagle, picking off 3 passes altogether, and finishing 3rd in the NFL in passes defensed.
* LB Kyzir White - White bucked the trend of budget free agent LB flops by being, well, quietly competent. White finished 2nd on the Eagles in tackles and was the best cover LB the team had seen in years.
* WR Zach Pascal - A favorite of Nick Sirianni’s in Indy, Pascal proved to be the consummate reserve WR, doing dirty work as a blocker and special teamer while being capable of catching the occasional pass.
* LB Robert Quinn - Acquired for a 4th round pick during the season, Quinn never really found his groove, mostly operating as a reserve DE before going on IR with a knee injury.
* DT Linval Joseph and DT Ndamukong Suh - Brought in to address concerns with DT depth and rush defense, Joseph and Suh provided quality veteran cover - and above all else, their arrival solidified the Eagles’ Super Bowl intentions.

**KEY DEPARTURES:**

* S Rodney McLeod (FA, IND) - McLeod filled the deep safety role admirably in Philly for 6 years, and one of his final plays as an Eagle was a game (and playoff) clinching interception against Washington. The Eagles needed to get younger in the secondary, and McLeod’s departure was part of that overhaul.
* LB Alex Singleton (FA, DEN) - Singleton working his way from CFL regular to NFL regular was a nice story. While he put up some nice tackling numbers in Philly, he just didn’t bring enough to the table to make him a mainstay in a new-look defense.
* CB Steven Nelson (FA, HOU) - The Eagles didn’t sign Nelson until July of last year, but he proved to be a solid, if unspectacular, CB2. The Texans gave Nelson the multi-year deal he should have gotten in 2021.
* WR Jalen Reagor (Trade, MIN) - What Reagor unquestionably brought to the Eagles was raw speed (he had the 8th fastest tracked speed for a ballcarrier in 2021 per Next Gen Stats). What he didn’t bring, though, were steady hands, route-running chops, or really any skill that would have made him even a remotely effective NFL WR. The Eagles cut their losses and traded the former 21st overall pick to Minnesota for 2 late picks before the season started.
* G Nate Herbig (Waivers, NYJ) - A former UDFA who started 17 games in 3 years and was once considered an option to be Jason Kelce’s successor, Herbig was crowded out of Philly by a younger, more athletic interior OL corps.
* RB Jordan Howard - In 2021, Howard had his most successful run of games since his first stint in Philly, notching double-digit touches in every game he was active, but like his first stint in Philly, his season was curtailed by injury. Though he was always rumored as an emergency RB signing, the Eagles went in another direction.

**DRAFT PICKS/KEY UDFA:**

* 1-13: Jordan Davis, DT, Georgia - It’s no understatement to call Davis one of the biggest athletic freaks in the NFL, and the Eagles traded up to make him one of the young centerpieces of their new-look D. Davis certainly looked good when he played; but some fans are left wondering why he didn’t play more.
* 2-51: Cam Jurgens, C, Nebraska - The Jurgens pick received the approval of Jason Kelce, and Jurgens didn’t disappoint in camp. He never had a prayer of unseating Kelce or any of the other OL starters, and didn’t play much during the season, but he flashed enough raw talent and athleticism to make the redshirt season worth the investment.
* 3-83: Nakobe Dean, LB, Georgia - Dean was considered the steal of the NFL draft, never showed the injury concerns that supposedly hurt his stock, and showed the same nose for the ball in preseason that he displayed at Georgia. But Dean never broke into the defensive rotation with T.J. Edwards and Kyzir White both staying healthy all year, being a special teams mainstay instead.
* 6-181: Kyron Johnson, LB, Kansas - A speedy, undersized edge rusher, Johnson mostly played on special teams as Haason Reddick and Patrick Johnson were ahead of him in the hybrid rusher role.
* 6-198: Grant Calcaterra, TE, SMU - Calcaterra was billed as a solid athlete with good receiving instinct for a TE and a questionable medical history. Calcaterra got offensive snaps in 15 games but rarely made plays, even when Dallas Goedert was injured.
* UDFA: Reed Blankenship, S, Middle Tennessee State - Blankenship rose up the depth chart in training camp to make the 53-man roster, and when CJGJ was injured, Blankenship stepped in admirably as a versatile safety, picking off Aaron Rodgers in his first start and hardly looking like an undrafted rookie. Even when CJDJ returned, the Eagles found a role for him in the defensive rotation.
* UDFA: Josh Jobe, CB, Alabama - A nice camp surprise, Jobe was the primary special teams gunner this season. Didn’t get many defensive snaps.
* UDFA: Britain Covey, WR/KR, Utah - Was the primary punt returner all year. Pretty effective if you consider fair catches exciting.

**Weekly Recap**

|Week|Score|Summary|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|PHI 38, @DET 35|The Eagles gave up a TD early, but in a sign of things to come, scored 38 points in the 2nd and 3rd quarters to take a 38-21 lead entering the 4th. Detroit scored 2 late TDs to come within 3, but the Eagles capped off a dominant rushing performance by killing off the final 3:51 with 7 straight runs.|
|2|@PHI 24, MIN 7 (MNF)|An all-around dominant primetime performance put the Eagles in the national spotlight. Jalen Hurts ran for 2 TDs and hooked up with Quez Watkins for another, and the defense put the Vikings on their heels early, limiting Dalvin Cook and Justin Jefferson and forcing 3 interceptions from Kirk Cousins.|
|3|PHI 24, @WAS 8|The Eagles showed Carson Wentz no mercy in their first game against him. They dominated the 2nd quarter again (24-0), with Hurts passing for 3 TDs, DeVonta Smith catching 8 balls for 169 yards and a TD, and the defense sacking Wentz 9 times and holding Washington's offense scoreless for 58 minutes.|
|4|@PHI 29, JAC 21|Rainy conditions made for a sloppy game, and the Eagles went down 14-0 early. But another strong 2nd quarter performance (20-0), aided by 5 Jaguars turnovers and a career day from Miles Sanders (27 carries/134 yards/2 TDs), saw them coast past former head coach (and Super Bowl winner) Doug Pederson.|
|5|PHI 20, @ARI 17|A difficult game where neither team took control came down to backup kickers. Cameron Dicker, replacing an injured Jake Elliott, nailed a go-ahead 23-yard FG with 1:45 left. Cards kicker Matt Ammendola, replacing Matt Prater, sealed an Eagles win when his 43-yard attempt with :22 left sailed right.|
|6|@PHI 26, DAL 17 (SNF)|The Cooper Rush hype train ended on a Sunday night in Philly, as the Eagles scored the first 20 points and forced 3 Rush picks. It wasn't as easy as other wins, as the Cowboys fought back to make it 20-17 in the 4th, but a 13-play, 75 yard, 7:37 TD drive effectively sealed the game.|
|7|BYE||
|8|@PHI 35, PIT 13|The Eagles lost none of their momentum from the bye, as Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown hooked up for 3 long 1st half TDs to bury the hapless Steelers. Kenny Pickett was sacked 6 times and turned the ball over twice, and other than a nifty trick TD pass from Chase Claypool, failed to threaten much.|
|9|PHI 29, @HOU 17 (TNF)|The 1-win Texans managed to hang with the Eagles for longer than expected, even taking a 14-14 tie into the half. But 7 minutes into the 3rd quarter, CJGJ intercepted Davis Mills deep in Texans territory, and Hurts and Brown connected for a go-ahead TD, taking a lead they would not relinquish.|
|10|WAS 32, @PHI 21 (MNF)|Hopes for a perfect season came to an agonizing end, as a consistently effective Washington run game saw them keep the ball for 40:24 and prevent the Eagles offense from the field. 4 Eagles turnovers, including 2 late fumbles - one of which was caused by a missed facemask - prevented a comeback.|
|11|PHI 17, @IND 16|The Colts scored a TD on their opening drive, and managed to hold the Eagles offense at bay for most of the game. But they couldn't keep them down for long enough; the Eagles rallied from a 13-3 deficit early in the 4th quarter to take the lead on a Hurts draw with 1:20 to go.|
|12|@PHI 40, GB 33 (SNF)|Both teams combined for 7 1st half TDs in an affair that proved ugly for both defenses. Ultimately, it was the Eagles who held firm, as the Packers D allowed a woeful 363 rushing yards, and despite a long TD from Jordan Love to Christian Watson, couldn't match the Eagles' efficiency.|
|13|@PHI 35, TEN 10|Any anxiety over the Eagles' recent ugly streak, or whether the Eagles' questionable run defense could contain Derrick Henry, evaporated quickly. The Eagles smothered the Titans offense, holding them to 209 total yards, as Hurts passed for 3 TDs and ran for another in a runaway victory.|
|14|PHI 48, @NYG 22|The Giants were no match for the Eagles on either side of the ball. The Eagles ran for 253 yards and 4 TDs and passed for another 2 TDs (highlighted by a long 4th down TD to DeVonta), while the defense racked up 7 sacks and only let the Giants offense across midfield once in the first 3 quarters.|
|15|PHI 25, @CHI 20|The Eagles struggled to put away the Bears in frigid, windy conditions - and the result of the game was marred by an injury to Jalen Hurts's right shoulder - but Hurts nevertheless willed Philly to victory with 3 rushing TDs, which along with a Dallas loss put them 1 win away from the NFC's 1 seed.|
|16|@DAL 40, PHI 34 (Saturday)|Gardner Minshew did everything he could to give the Eagles a chance, throwing for 355 yards and 2 TDs and running for another, but the Eagles defense had its worst showing of the year. The Cowboys capitalized on a blown 3rd-and-30 and 2 4th quarter Eagles turnovers to pull out a Christmas Eve win.|
|17|NO 20, @PHI 10|If Minshew was almost a hero in Week 16, he was anything but this week. Despite the defense generating 7 sacks and largely shutting the Saints down, Minshew was sacked 6 times and threw a 4th quarter pick-6 as the offense struggled for any sort of momentum, failing to clinch the 1 seed yet again.|
|18|@PHI 22, NYG 16|The Eagles finally clinched the 1 seed in a largely vanilla contest, with the Giants resting their starters and the Eagles eager to protect Jalen Hurts's shoulder. Although a late Giants TD put a slight scare into the home crowd, this game never really felt as close as the score indicated.|
|Wild Card|BYE||
|Divisional|@PHI 38, NYG 7|This game looked more like Week 14 than Week 18. The Eagles scored TDs on their first 2 drives, sacked Daniel Jones on 4th down on the Giants' first drive, then picked him off on the next drive. They took a 28-0 lead into half, rushed for 268 yards, and sacked the Giants 5 times.|
|NFC Championship|@PHI 31, SF 7|It's easy to point out that the Eagles were aided by knocking both 49ers QBs out of the game. But the Eagles simply wore the 49ers down as the game went on, rushing for 148 yards and 4 scores against one of the league's best rushing defenses, making the Super Bowl for the 4th time in team history.|
|Super Bowl LVII|KC 38, PHI 35|In the most offensively-dominated Super Bowl since SB52, the Eagles took an early lead and did their best to keep Mahomes off the field. But despite a herculean effort by Hurts, the defense let up one too many times, with a late penalty setting up a Chiefs game-winning FG with 8 seconds left.|

**Roster Overview**

QB (A-): **Jalen Hurts** put himself squarely in the MVP discussion - what more needs to be said? He was everything for the Eagles this year: passing weapon, short yardage back, team leader, and, in all likelihood, the QB of the future. Had **Gardner Minshew** won either of his 2 starts late in the year, I would have given the corps an A+, but alas.

RB (B): **Miles Sanders** found the consistency and health that had both eluded him thus far in his career, setting career highs in carries, rushing yards, and rushing touchdowns. As a result, **Kenneth Gainwell** and **Boston Scott** didn’t see as much action, but Gainwell came alive during the playoffs and Scott brought some much-needed juice to the kick return role late in the season.

WR (A-): Yes, **A.J. Brown** lived up to the hype and then some, putting together his best NFL season. But don’t overlook **DeVonta Smith**’s major step forward, as the two formed arguably the most formidable young WR duo in the NFL. **Quez Watkins** was the next WR up after Brown and Smith, and while he still showed the skill of a burner, he was a bit more inconsistent due to Brown, Smith, and Goedert swallowing up most of the targets. **Zach Pascal** wasn’t asked to do much, but as a WR4 mainly asked to block and play special teams, he was effective.

TE (B): For the first time, **Dallas Goedert** entered a season as the Eagles’ TE1, and operated nicely as the Eagles’ underneath middle-of-field option. He was on pace for career highs across the board until a shoulder injury sidelined him for 5 games. **Jack Stoll** reprised his role as the blocking TE2, and while he wasn’t involved much as a receiver, was an integral part of the Eagles’ rushing attack as a blocker on the move. **Grant Calcaterra** didn’t see much action as a rookie, even in Goedert’s absence. **Tyree Jackson** came back from an ACL injury midseason, but the former QB didn’t see a target.

OT (B+): **Lane Johnson** reminded everyone of the sort of force he can be when he’s fully healthy, being named 1st Team All-Pro for the 2nd time in his career, while giving up 0 sacks in 651 dropbacks and setting the tone as a run blocker. On the blindside, **Jordan Mailata** proved that his breakout 2021 was no fluke; while he was slightly more up and down than Lane, it speaks more to Lane’s excellence than anything with Mailata, who should remain a franchise caliber LT for many years. **Jack Driscoll** started 1 game at LT and 2 games at RT when injuries hit; he’s not necessarily starting caliber as a tackle but is still very much a valuable utility player.

iOL (A-): The trio of **Landon Dickerson**, **Jason Kelce**, and **Isaac Seumalo** started every single game, and it’s no surprise that their talent and stability were critical in the Eagles’ efficient rushing attack, and their basically automatic QB sneak. Kelce’s 5th All-Pro season puts him in all-time territory for NFL centers; him not being named a 1st ballot Hall of Famer would be a shame. Dickerson flashed elite potential, only allowing 1 sack all year and being named to the Pro Bowl, but he also led all NFL linemen in accepted penalties. Seumalo may be the least flashy of the Eagles’ OL but he was nevertheless a consistently solid two-way blocker. **Andre Dillard**, **Sua Opeta**, and **Cam Jurgens** didn’t see much game action as a result.

iDL (B): **Javon Hargrave** followed up his dominant 2021 with an even more productive 2022, buoyed by a much-improved pass-rushing cast. **Fletcher Cox**’s best years are certainly past him, but when the Eagles bolstered their depth partway through the season, they were finally able to get the most out of his snaps. **Jordan Davis** looked every bit the menacing nose tackle he was in college, but the 13th overall pick was still raw as a pass rusher and also missed time with injury. The injury prompted the Eagles to sign **Ndamukong Suh** and **Linval Joseph**, and for part-season players, they were effective enough, with Joseph spelling Davis at NT and Suh mainly part of the pass-rushing rotation. With all the other big names on the interior, it was easy to overlook 2nd-year players **Milton Williams** and **Marlon Tulipulotu**, but both took a step forward this year - Williams as a pass-rushing complement to Jordan Davis and Tulipulotu showing potential both on the interior and further outside.

EDGE (A-): Along with Javon Hargrave, the trio of **Haason Reddick**, **Josh Sweat**, and **Brandon Graham** all notched double-digit sacks. Reddick was a heat-seeking missile in his first season in Philly, and his athleticism and versatility unlocked more of the Eagles’ defensive potential. Sweat was similarly effective in his 2nd season as full-time starter; while he didn’t get a Pro Bowl nod like in 2021, he was even more dangerous as a pass rusher, playing more on the outside and getting 11.0 sacks. Graham’s recovery from a torn Achilles was nothing short of remarkable; while he saw a much reduced snap share from his prime, he still a career-high with 11.0 sacks in a Comeback Player of the Year level season. When **Derek Barnett** tore his ACL in Week 1 and Tarron Jackson couldn’t fill in effectively on the DL, the Eagles picked up **Robert Quinn** to provide veteran leadership and pass rushing efficiency in a reduced role, but he didn’t record a sack in 6 games in green. **Patrick Johnson** and **Kyron Johnson** were the backup hybrid rushers; both were regular special teamers, but largely unremarkable.

LB (B): The Eagles typically operated in nickel formation, with **T.J. Edwards** as the SAM and **Kyzir White** as the WILL. Their stability was crucial to the Eagles’ defensive prowess - Edwards was a complete LB - a tackling machine with a nose for the ball both going forward as well as in coverage, while White was a stable presence who could cover when called upon, a skill rarely seen in recent Eagles LBs. For all the hype around **Nakobe Dean** in college, White’s health kept him off the field on defense, though he did look good in the few snaps he got and improved as a special teamer as the season went on. **Shaun Bradley** also rarely saw defensive snaps as the backup MIKE, but the special teams captain was likewise a consistent special teams presence. **Christian Elliss** was a late season promotion to the active roster after a couple explosive special teams plays as a practice squad call up; he could be a regular special teamer in 2023.

CB (A-): The trio of **Darius Slay**, **James Bradberry**, and **Avonte Maddox** was one of the league’s best when healthy. Slay was named a defensive captain for the first time in his career and was a consistent threat in the secondary, although his play dipped slightly later in the season. Maddox missed 8 games in the first season of his extension, but when he was healthy, his versatility, agility and surprising physicality was a major part of the coverage scheme. Bradberry was the perfect playmaking puzzle piece to the secondary, earning a 2nd-team All-Pro nod for his play. **Josiah Scott** took over slot CB duties when Maddox was hurt; he was a noticeable step down from Maddox, but did pick off 2 passes. **Zech McPhearson**, **Josh Jobe**, and **Andre Chachere** were all core special teamers, only seeing defensive snaps in blowouts.

S (B): The Eagles had long favored **Marcus Epps** as one of the 2022 starters, but while Epps was decent if unspectacular, it was **C.J. Gardner-Johnson** who ended up as the secondary’s primary playmaker. CJGJ started slow as he adapted to the playbook, but he would lead the team in interceptions despite missing time with a kidney laceration. **Reed Blankenship** went from UDFA special teamer to excellent safety fill-in when CJGJ was hurt; the five-year college starter was an excellent tackler and even picked off Aaron Rodgers in his first start. **K’Von Wallace** hasn’t quite followed in the footsteps of his Clemson colleague Brian Dawkins, but Wallace led the Eagles’ special teams in tackles and is a solid tackler and run stuffer in limited reps.

ST (C-): The Eagles didn’t call upon **Jake Elliott** often this season, not because Elliott was bad, but because the Eagles’ efficient red zone offense and overall aggressiveness made Elliott’s big leg unnecessary for field goals. That said, only Brett Maher had more touchbacks on kickoffs than Elliott. Arryn Siposs improved his gross and net punt averages in his second season, but was still well below average overall. And somehow, **Brett Kern** was worse. Not much was said about **Rick Lovato** this year - not that that’s a bad thing for a long snapper. Can’t ignore **Cameron Dicker**’s Special Teamer of the Week performance.

**Coaching/FO Overview**

*GM Howie Roseman* \- It may have been easy for Eagles fans to call for Howie’s head after the dismal 2020 campaign, and I fully admit I was one of them. But Jeffrey Lurie stuck by Howie in that turbulent time, and, well, it was the right decision.

In the 2 years since, the Eagles have shed a lot of dead weight, added a slew of young, homegrown talent, and maneuvered their way into one of the NFL’s most talented rosters while still keeping their options open for the future. What Howie’s proven to be best at, and certainly better than the past few years, is finding an edge at the margins. It’s easy to attribute his success to drafting better, when drafting is a crapshoot. It’s easy to be lauded as a cap wizard for the simple act of restructuring contracts, even though 31 other teams do it too. But it’s about the little value moves - executing a trade for A.J. Brown when few teams knew he was on the market, or picking up extra draft capital from desperate teams (cheers to you, Miami and New Orleans), or pouncing on players like James Bradberry and CJGJ when their respective teams couldn’t keep them around due to cap concerns, or hiring a little-known head coaching candidate who would become one of the NFL’s best in-game decision-makers, or even having faith in the players who were already on the team (Jalen Hurts, Jordan Mailata, T.J. Edwards, among others) to grow into being franchise cornerstones.

But it’s one thing to get to the top - now it’s about being able to stay there. The Eagles were at the top, and came crashing down. If Howie continues to practice the same value moves that got him to the top, the Eagles should continue to be Super Bowl contenders for as long as Jalen Hurts is in his prime.

*HC Nick Sirianni*: It’s highly poetic that the Eagles’ NFC Championship victory came 2 years to the day after Sirianni’s first press conference as Eagles head coach, where he was widely lambasted as an awkward, stuttering mess. But it’s an appropriate symbol for how far Sirianni’s leadership has brought the team in 2 seasons.

Like Doug Pederson before him, Sirianni has earned a reputation for both being a players’ coach and a master of in-game decision-making. Whether it’s knowing when to challenge a play, take a timeout vs. a delay of game, or knowing when to go for it on 4th down, no coach has been better than Sirianni at [giving his team the edge](https://i.redd.it/2l4ac5qc8oda1.jpg) in borderline game situations. And on top of that, his energy and swagger are a perfect match for the NFL’s most rabid fanbase. Especially when Eagles fans know [everyone else hates it](https://www.phillyvoice.com/eagles-rivals-are-developing-hatred-nick-sirianni-his-players-love-him-super-bowl/).

*OC Shane Steichen*: Chargers offensive coordinator is hired to be the Eagles’ offensive coordinator under a new coach, then departs for the Colts’ head coaching role two years later after a Super Bowl run. Deja vu? Maybe a bit, but hopefully Steichen can be more successful than Frank Reich.

Sirianni relinquished the offensive playcalling duties to Steichen a few weeks into 2021, and the Eagles haven’t really looked back since. Whether on the ground or through the air, the Eagles offense could carve defenses of any quality up. You don’t get to be the NFL’s second-best scoring team by accident.

Of course, the Colts won’t have Jalen Hurts, a loaded skill position corps, or a talented OL, which will test Steichen’s bonafides early. He’s elevated a weak offense before - can he do it again?

*DC Jonathan Gannon*: For all the success of the Eagles’ defense this year, Gannon still remains a polarizing figure. Yes, the Eagles’ defense vastly improved this year to become one of the most formidable units in the NFL. Yes, some of the Gannon criticism could be a bit harsh and nitpicky at times. Yes, Gannon’s defense is hardly the first one in Eagles history to falter in a big game situation - Jim Schwartz’s unit gave up 613 yards in Super Bowl LII, only saved because of Doug Pederson and Nick Foles.

But at the same time, what separates the great DCs from the pack is their ability to get a defense to play greater than the sum of its parts, and it just didn’t seem like that’s what happened enough with Gannon. For all the dominant performances, Gannon’s scheme was prone to imploding one too many times against great passing teams (see: Super Bowl LVII, the Week 16 game v. Dallas, and so on.) And the relative passiveness of Gannon’s scheme was a stark contrast to the historical aggressiveness of defensive coaches like Buddy Ryan, Jim Johnson, and Schwartz, all of whom are beloved in Philly.

It was long rumored that Gannon would be a head coach somewhere sooner rather than later, and the Cardinals came calling quickly after the Super Bowl. Again, the question will be whether he can elevate a less talented defense.

*STC Michael Clay*: It’s not great for a special teams coordinator when your unit gets noticed for the wrong reasons - the Eagles were 24th in special teams DVOA through Week 12, with the Eagles struggling to cover kicks and generate returns of their own. But Clay at least deserves some credit for a late season turnaround, making enough personnel and scheme adjustments to bump the Eagles’ special teams DVOA up to 13th by the end of the regular season.

It’s a shame that the Eagles’ special team warts showed up at the wrong time - namely the long Kadarius Toney punt return that set up a Chiefs TD in the Super Bowl - but Clay is still young, and the Eagles don’t have many special teams-only players filling their roster.

Position Coaches of note:

* Few assistant coaches in the NFL get as much praise as OL coach/run game coordinator **Jeff Stoutland**, and it’s pretty easy to see why. “Stoutland University” is the hottest institution in Philly today, churning out quality OL after quality OL. Whether it’s molding an elite athletic prospect into a generational talent (Jason Kelce, Lane Johnson) or churning out versatile backups (Jack Driscoll, Vaitai) or even just teaching a large athlete the game from the ground up (Jordan Mailata), Stoutland always seems to get the best out of whoever the Eagles give him. A great match for an organization that puts tremendous emphasis on the trenches.
* Some people might remember **Brian Johnson** as the cover athlete for NCAA Football 10. (Or maybe the lead singer from AC/DC.) But Brian Johnson the QB coach is arguably one of the biggest reasons for Jalen Hurts’s development over the past 2 years - [even Hurts says so himself](https://twitter.com/JClarkNBCS/status/1623722202746228738). When Steichen left for Indy, Johnson was the immediate favorite to replace him as OC, and if it weren’t in Philly, Johnson would definitely have gotten OC looks elsewhere.
* A longtime coaching veteran at the college level, **Tracy Rocker** joined the Eagles in 2021 when Sirianni joined the team, and along with assistent **Jeremiah Washburn** (the son of longtime DL coach Jim Washburn) turned the Eagles’ defensive front into one of the most dominant in the game.
* Among internal candidates, the most likely replacement for Jonathan Gannon was DB coach/passing game coordinator **Dennard Wilson**. Wilson coached under Gregg Williams and Jeff Fisher, and served under Lovie Smith, so even though he’s only 40 he’s had a chance to work with multiple great defensive minds. But after the Eagles named Sean Desai the DC, Wilson parted ways with the team.

**2023 Offseason Needs, as of March 16**

DEFCON 1:

S - Both starters were pending free agents, and there aren’t any in-house replacements on hand. The Eagles continue to make a charge to bring home CJGJ, but with Epps already gone, they’ll have 2 new starters here in 2023 if the push for CJGJ is unsuccessful, both likely from outside the org.

DEFCON 2:

LB - Like safety, both starters were pending free agents, and both were snatched up within the first couple days of legal tampering. While Nakobe Dean should occupy one of the starting spots, the Eagles will have to find a new MLB to incorporate within Sean Desai’s scheme.

DEFCON 3:

TE - Dallas Goedert is a front-line TE1, but his injury exposed the shallowness of the Eagles’ TE corps. The Eagles drafted Goedert before Zach Ertz’s age 28 season, and Goedert turned 28 in January, so they could look to the long term again.

iDL - 4 different DTs, including Javon Hargrave and Fletcher Cox, were pending free agents. There is some young talent waiting in the wings, and re-signing Cox should at least help with depth, but Hargrave will be tough to replace.

EDGE - Josh Sweat and Haason Reddick are great, and Brandon Graham will likely return. But the Eagles like their rotations, and beyond those 3 there’s a bit of a dropoff.

DEFCON 4:

QB - There’s no questioning Jalen Hurts’s starting position, but the only other QB under contract is Ian Book, who’s far below the standard of a typical Eagles backup QB.

OL - The Eagles’ starting OL should be fine in the short term with Jason Kelce coming back and Cam Jurgens projected to replace Isaac Seumalo. But Kelce and Lane Johnson are close to the end of their respective careers, so the Eagles could invest again in young talent.

DEFCON 5:

RB - The Eagles let Miles Sanders walk in favor of Rashaad Penny, who’s shown undeniable talent but has been a victim of horrendous injury luck. With Boston Scott re-signed as well, the Eagles are pretty much set for 2023, but they could look to the draft for answers beyond this year.

WR - The Eagles have one of the NFL’s best young WR duos, if not the best. And while Quez Watkins was inconsistent, the Eagles don’t need much from him beyond his 4.28 speed.

CB - The Eagles brought back James Bradberry, then cut Darius Slay, but didn’t actually cut Darius Slay, so there isn’t really any hole here, apart from a lack of young prospects.

ST - It’s possible the Eagles make a change at punter, but the probability of that isn’t high.",alcatraz_0109,92,188,0.86
33,NFL Road Trip: Driving route to see all 32 teams play a home game in the 2023 season,11sypzo,"So, I've been doing this fun mental exercise every year since 2020 to see how one could do a theoretical road trip to see all 32 teams play a home game in the season. I see other redditors have also done this exercise. Well, the 2023 schedule comes out on May 11th this year, so I'm proposing that those who want to try this, especially those who have done it before, cross-post their results here.

Here were my preferred routes for the last 2 seasons. One practical strategy I've tried to employ is avoiding winter driving and generally start the trip in the north or northeast in early weeks, and progress to the south or southwest in Nov/Dec.

In the 2021 table below, yellow shade is when travelling takes almost or more than 1/3 of available time between games, orange is longer trips when travelling takes more than 1/2 of available time, and red are shorter trips where travelling takes up to or substantially more than 1/2 of available time. That super dark red once for 2021 is the ""zero float"" trip, where a Sunday 1 PM EST game is attended in full, then you must immediately drive to the next destination for the Sunday night game.

For the 2022 table, I just generally shaded from slightly (light) to most difficult (dark), using the same criteria - ratio of time driving to time available, with longer trips being tougher.

The 2022 table has more data, I'll use that same format for 2023. All time and distance data provided by Google Maps; lengths in miles and time in hours.

1) Chicago - Poles has proven me wrong, and has utilized his cap space marvelously. Very excited about the draft.  
  
2) Kansas City - Rich have gotten richer and retooled. Honestly they got a lot better in a short amount of time.  
  
3) Giants - This is my sleeper pick. Securing Jones is a big move. They kept Barkley, and added Waller, and haven’t lost a lot of their own guys. Excited to see what happens next.  
  
Losers IMO:  
  
1) Jacksonville - Their guys have been getting poached left and right.

He likely would’ve been the second fastest linebacker at the Combine. He also put up a 42.5” Vert and 10’11 broad, both of which would’ve been the best at his position at the Combine. His 29 reps of 225 would’ve been tied for best among LB’s at the Combine. I don’t think he is even projected to be drafted, but he might’ve just gotten himself drafted with those numbers. He had 73 total tackles his senior year, 25 solo. So Not an Uber productive linebacker, but certainly was a big part of MSU’s defense being the third leading tackler.

48,Teams of the AAFC: The Miami Seahawks,11s0er5,"This is the first part of a series looking at the teams of the All American Football Conference, a league that sprung up just after WWII and that contributed two of the most successful teams of the NFL. I'm going to go very roughly from worst to best so if you know your NFL history, you know where that's going to end.

The origins of NFL teams reflected the times when they were created. The original NFL teams were small groups from mediums sized towns who decided to play together. It was a sport. even the highest level would be considered semi-pro at best. Players and owners had other occupations that filled the great majority of their lives. Playing football was a side occupation.  By the thirty's the game took a turn for the serious. NFL were more commonly based in big cities, going from towns like Akron, Canton and Providence to New York, Philadelphia and Chicago.  The sport hung on during the great depression and established itself. It wasn't at the universal level of popularity of Baseball, even college football saw greater crowds. Players would quit to make more money in other sports, such as wrestling. And as the nation clawed out of economic difficulties the league focused on stability rather than growth.

Like everything else, pro football would be affected by the changes in America during and after the second world war. Not only was the nation weather than before but also the populace on a whole had gone thru training, either in military or manufacturing that raised the level of organization and general competence across the board. 

During the war the NFL had faced cancellation and been forced to combine teams to deal with both players and fans being involved in the war effort. After the war ended they just wanted to go back to normal but there were others who wanted in. With the NFL unwilling to expand a new league began to form. Six teams collected together rather quickly and Brooklyn followed after. The league had hoped to have the eight team in Baltimore but when the team couldn't come to an agreement with the stadium another location needed to be found. Miami was chosen out of four choices and an Atlanta restaurant owner Harvey Hester was awarded the team. A fairly decent coaching staff was quickly assembled and then the team was assembled. The head coach was fairly happy with his team and their chances. 

Then they ran into reality in the form of the Cleveland Browns and lost 44-0. Then they lost their next three games. By the time they were  1- 5 their coach had enough and quit. The backfield coach and a player shared the head coaching position for the rest of the season.

One of the oddities of the AAFC's first year was their schedule. They tried to make sure to have decent weather for most of the games. For cold weather teams like Buffalo, that mean a lot of home games early on. Because Miami's weather was more temperate they had most of their home games late in the schedule, long after they had any hope of a winning season. Attendance suffered accordingly. At the end of the season the owner was deeply in debt and the team declared bankruptcy.

Ironically, the team was purchased by a group that moved them to Baltimore and renamed them the Colts. This is not the Colts team that later won with Johnny Unitas and later moved to Indianapolis. Although the Colts were one of the teams to merge with the NFL, they lasted a season before being sold back to the league. The Colts team that was formed in 1953 was built from the ruins of the first Dallas Texans, who came from the New York Yanks, who came from the New York Bulldogs and on back to (potentially) the Dayton Triangles.

One of the interesting bits about the AAFC is how much even their defunct teams left to the NFL. the Buffalo ball club renamed itself from the Buffalo Bisons to the Buffalo Bills and the AFL version of the Buffalo team named itself the Bills. The second Baltimore Colts borrowed much of the imagery from the Colts of the AAFC, only in blue rather than green. 

Both the Miami Dolphins and the University of Miami use green and orange in their uniforms and so did the Miami Seahawks (The U did it first) 

[The original uniforms were orange, white and green](https://i.imgur.com/kY9fbNh.png)

[and tried some color variations](https://i.imgur.com/ClXDhUH.jpg)

[The best of the realistically colored versions of the drawing](https://i.imgur.com/MzFhVqC.jpg)

I wanted to stay with Orange and green because it's Miami and you should be using fun colors but doing so made the osprey look like a parrot.

[I tried some variations of a helmet using both a historic and realistic color scheme](https://i.imgur.com/82TgLVI.jpg)

[Even did one where the helmet was the head](https://i.imgur.com/YHlGqF9.jpg)

In the end I took some advice and cut down the number of colors. Rather than using the full shading on the drawing it now was just white and orange.

[An alternative based on a more realistic osprey coloring](https://i.imgur.com/OUrU7z2.jpg)

If someone wonders what a modernized AAFC Baltimore Colts would look like just look at the modern Colts and imagine green substituted for blue. 

Here's the list of the teams that I've already done.

#General Season Overview

In AD 68, the Roman Emperor Nero, generally despised by the rich and powerful senatorial class (though recent scholarship has shown that he was rather more well-liked by the general population - but the senators wrote the histories), was overthrown in a revolt by multiple senatorial leaders, most prominently Galba. He committed suicide, ending the Julio-Claudian dynasty that dated back to Julius Caesar himself, and Galba took the reins of the Roman Empire. He couldn’t hold onto the top job, though, as he was assassinated just a few weeks into the new year of 69 AD. This set off a chaotic year where the top generals in the Empire all jockeyed for position. For the first part of the year, Otho, Galba’s assassin, had power, but Vitellius and his Rhine legions had revolted at the same time as Otho’s legions, and Vitellius was already on the warpath. He was the next claimant after defeating Otho (and causing his suicide), but proved to be vicious and cruel. Vespasian, the leader of the legions stationed in the east of the empire, marched to Rome with the support of the Danube legions and the Italian population, and Vitellius was killed very late in the year, making Vespasian the fourth man who held the top job in a wild year. It would end up being known as the Year of the Four Emperors.

The 2022-23 season for the San Francisco 49ers will likely forever be known as the Year of the Four Quarterbacks. The analogy isn’t perfect - I’m pretty sure Josh Johnson, the Vespasian in this analogy, isn’t the solution at QB for the next ten years - but just in terms of the wild swings back and forth, it fits. The turbulence at football’s most important position was the defining factor in a year of what-could-have-been for the Niners. For a season where the Faithful lost their faith and were convinced that the season was over at least three separate times, to have a loss in the NFC Championship Game feel disappointing is a remarkable result - and yet, for those of us who experienced it, it makes perfect sense.

The 49ers were something of an enigma coming into the season. They were 10-7 the previous season, but had managed a Cinderella run to the NFC Championship game and were a dropped interception [insert Jaquiski Tartt gif here] from the Super Bowl. Everyone knew they had a solid defense, and plenty of firepower at the skill positions, but the team’s season seemed to hinge on one factor: the performance of Trey Lance. After a “redshirt” season in his first year (that happened to include a couple games filling in for Jimmy Garoppolo), Jimmy G’s struggles in the playoffs and injury going into the offseason suggested that the 49ers had been right to trade up to get his replacement, and this season was going to be all about handing Lance the keys and see how far he could take this team. In the best case scenario, he could stand in and take advantage of all the 49ers weapons, bringing the team back to the NFC Championship game with a chance to go to the Super Bowl.

Some parts of that sentence went according to plan!

It turned out that the Niners, indeed, built a juggernaut of a team. The skill positions were loaded with multifunctional weapons like WR/HB Deebo Samuel, FB/TE Kyle Jusczyk, and TE/WR/RT/absolutely everything else George Kittle. Partway through the season, the team added another in HB/WR Christian McCaffrey, and found out that unlike in basketball, where offensive ball-dominant playmakers sometimes have diminishing returns, in football the opposite is true. Those playmakers, along with strong seasons from WR Brandon Aiyuk and HB Elijah Mitchell and the usual standout blocking from LT Trent Williams, all working in the creative and explosive scheme of Kyle Shanahan, powered a dynamic, endlessly entertaining offense. The defense may have been even better, anchored by well-deserving DPOY Nick Bosa and a player who many think is even better in LB Fred Warner, with massive performances up and down the roster from LB Dre Greenlaw, SS Talanoa Hufanga, and CB Charvarius Ward. 

After a slow and injury-plagued start to the year - more on injuries later - the team ripped off 12 wins in a row and looked unbelievably dominant throughout. During that 12 win streak, the team’s average margin of victory was 15.5. In only one game - the first in the winning streak, against the Rams - did the other team’s win probability ever cross 60% in the second half, according to ESPN (the only other games where there was one point in the second half the team was even favored were Week 10 vs the Chargers, week 17 vs the Raiders, and the divisional round against the Cowboys). At one point, their defense didn’t allow a single point in the second half - for four straight weeks.

So, Trey struggled initially but they righted the ship, right? Well, actually, he played one game and then broke his ankle, forcing the team to their backup QB. 

Teams usually don’t recover from losing their starting QB for the rest of the season in week 2, but the 49ers backup was a familiar face and unusually experienced: Jimmy Garoppolo. The Niners had planned to trade Jimmy and his massive contract and hand the keys to Lance, but Garoppolo’s injury scared teams away and he ended up re-working his deal to return to SF. And it was a good thing, too. After struggling in his first few starts, Jimmy went on a tear. Especially after the Niners acquired Christian McCaffrey - a move that, at 3-3, many criticized as being too all-in - the Niners started winning, and winning, and winning. Not in spite of Jimmy, either - he was playing the best football of his career.

And then it all came crashing down again. Garoppolo broke his foot in Week 13 against the Dolphins. Some teams have survived losing their starting QBs, but no team has survived losing two, even one as good as the Niners. That’s especially true when the third-string QB is an unheralded 7th round rookie, whose only notoriety is being Mr. Irrelevant - the very last player picked in the draft. No Mr. Irrelevant had ever completed a forward pass in a game, much less lead a playoff-hopeful team as the starter. There was no way this Brock Purdy could save the 49ers.

Then Brock Purdy saved the 49ers. An argument can be made that he was one of the very best QBs in the league over the last 5 weeks of the season and first 2 weeks of the playoffs. The Niners just kept winning and finished the season winning 10 in a row, earning the 2nd seed in the NFC. Purdy kept up his dominance as the 49ers overcame a slow start to rout the Seattle Seahawks in the wild-card round, and was solid if unspectacular in the divisional round win over the Cowboys that was led by the defense. The 49ers were clicking on all cylinders as everyone was ready for an amazing matchup with the team that had been the class of the NFC all year, the Philadelphia Eagles.

Then it all fell apart again. After the Eagles were gifted a touchdown on their first drive when no challenge (or expedited review) was used on a 4th and 3 catch, on the 49ers first possession, Purdy was strip sacked, tearing his UCL. Josh Johnson - the 49ers fourth QB of the season - entered and kept the 49ers in the game despite struggling, before he too was claimed by the injury gods with a concussion. The Niners were reduced to running every play despite being down by 2, then 3 scores. It turns out a team really CAN’T survive a season-ending injury to its FOURTH quarterback.

And with that, the 49ers entered what should be at once a fairly boring offseason (~~they probably don't have the resources to make a major move~~ HELLO JAVON HARGRAVE) and an incredibly unpredictable offseason (say, have you heard about the quarterback situation?). This season legitimately could have ended with them missing the playoffs or winning the Super Bowl. Next season will likely have the same spread. Whatever happens, it will undoubtedly be entertaining - and take up inordinate amounts of time on SportsCenter.

#Game By Game Review

Before the game-by-game breakdown, most games that you win should feel good about (even if you won on a last second play), the 49ers season had a lot of wins, but often at the cost of key players seemingly every week. So yay! We won! But really we are now without [Insert Key Player] for [X] weeks?! I hope we can weather the storm.

#High points

(by /u/HandSack135)

*A 10 week win string to end the regular season? That’s pretty nice (+2 more in the playoffs). 

* Going 6-0 in the division for the first time under Kyle and the first time ever in a long time? That’s pretty nice. 

* Going 3-0 against Seattle. That’s pretty nice. 

* Ending the Cowboys season on a LOLZ, that’s also pretty nice. You are welcome everyone else. 


#Low points

(by /u/HandSack135)

The lowest point of the season was the NFC Championship game. Plain and simple. With a roster loaded with talent and playmakers all over the field, we lost yet another Quarterback and Kyle just didn’t have any magic left to make the 4^th stringer work. It sucked for a few reasons:

* We lost out on a chance to the Super Bowl being the obvious one

* We are left with an off season of wondering, could Purdy have beaten Jalen Hurts and continued the greatest QB rookie run in the history of the NFL?
 
* We lost Purdy for 6 months (now maybe more?) as he will have UCL surgery 

The second lowest point was the hours/days after losing to the Kansas City Chiefs. Our defense was playing at its lowest level for a two game stretch. Fans and talking heads were once again all over Jimmy G. (he did have a really bad INT in the red zone) and we were back below .500 for the season. Some guy posted this… in the post game thread, but he wouldn’t self-promote. 

(Author's note: Also, the games against the Bears and Broncos were pretty bad, and worse in hindsight. That was a very different team.)

#Offseason Preview

##Upcoming Free Agents

The 49ers have a LOT of key contributors up for free agency at every position. They currently have only $7 million in cap room, but expect them to make more by reworking some contracts - this is a team that is built to win now, and they will likely try to re-sign some of the key contributors on this list or bring in other free agents to fill the voids. The key prize is RT Mike McGlinchey, but other contributors, such as Samson Ebukam, Azeez Al-Shaair, Daniel Brunskill, Tashaun Gipson, and Charles Omenihu are likely to draw serious interest from other teams. Below is my personal view of how likely each is to return next year, from ""Likely Back"" to ""Likely Gone."" (Note that the 49ers have already extended Taybor Pepper and Colton McKivitz, so they are not included here).

Player | Position | Snaps| Grade | Likelihood of Return
---|---|----|----|----
Jimmie Ward | DB | 640|A- | Signed Elsewhere
Jimmy Garoppolo | QB |612 | A | Signed Elsewhere
Samson Ebukam | ED | 681 | B- | Signed Elsewhere
Emmanuel Moseley | CB | 312 | INC | Likely Back
Mike McGlinchey | RT | 1210 |B-| Signed Elsewhere
Azeez Al-Shaair | LB | 383 |A-| Signed Elsewhere
Robbie Gould | K | 207 |B| Likely Gone
Daniel Brunskill | OG | 609 |B| Signed Elsewhere
Hassan Ridgeway | DT | 285 |C| Signed Elsewhere
Kerry Hyder | DT | 410 |D- |Likely Gone
Tyler Kroft | TE | 256 |F |Likely Gone
Maurice Hurst | DT | 0 |N/A| Likely Gone
Tashaun Gipson | FS | 1221 | B+ | Back!
Josh Johnson | QB | 45 | C |Likely Gone
Jordan Willis | DE | 266| OTH |Maybe Gone
Ross Dwelley | TE | 101 | OTH |50-50
Jake Brendel | C | 1252 | C+|Back!
Jason Verrett | CB | 0 |INC |50-50
Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles | LB | 99 | OTH |Likely Back
Kevin Givens | DT | 428 | D| Back!
Tarvarius Moore | FS | 60 |OTH |50-50
Charles Omenihu | DE | 659 | B+ | Signed Elsewhere

## Free Agent Targets

> The 49ers don't have a ton of cash to make a big splash in the off-season, so it's possible they just go after their own players, especially **McGlinchey**, **Brunskill**, **Omenihu**, **Ebukam,** **Al-Shaair**, **Gipson**, and **Moseley**. If they lose some or all of those players, however, they may get active in the free agent market. **Orlando Brown** would be a fantastic replacement to McGlinchey, but maybe **Kaleb McGary** is more in their price range. **Dre'Mont Jones** could help out on the defensive line, or they could go big and try to get **Javon Hargrave** or **Daron Payne**. **Dalton Schultz** could be a good TE pairing with Kittle. If they lose some of their offensive line, possible replacements could be **Nate Davis**, **Dalton Risner,** or **Isaac Seumalo**. Lastly, they may be interested in **Jordan Poyer** or **Jessie Bates III** if Gipson leaves or retires, and they could look at **James Bradberry** to pair with Ward. Those are all dream targets, but more likely is that the 49ers will have a fairly quiet offseason and sign mostly veterans who are interested in coming and winning on the cheap. They will also likely get a veteran QB, but not an expensive one - think **Baker Mayfield** level. Expect the 49ers to kick the tires on any free agent who isn't a top QB or RB though - the 49ers have their stars locked up, but they can always use depth at any position.

>No, the 49ers are not going to be in the **Lamar Jackson** market. More on that later.

That was what I wrote before free agency actually started. And hey, pretty good predictions! So far, the 49ers re-signed Tashaun Gipson, Jae Brendel, and Kevin Givens and signed Sam Darnold, fulfilling my predictions about going after their own players and signing a ~~backup backup QB~~ **THE GEQBUS** on the cheap. The bigger news is that they got one of my ""go big"" targets in Javon Hargrave. That probably basically blows the budget for any other big name free agents, but don't underestimate the influence that Hargrave will have, especially on the team's pass rush, which goes from ""quite scary"" with Bosa, Armstead, and whatever other edge rusher to ""downright terrifying.""

The big area of need is now the offensive line, now that McGlinchey has left.
 
##Draft Preview

Round | Pick
---|---
3 | 99
3 | 101
3 | 102
5 | 155
5 | 164
5 | 173
6 | 216
7 | 222
7 | 247
7 | 253
7 | 255

Beyond their limited cap space, the 49ers have another issue - very little premium draft capital. They have no picks before the end of the third round. They had just 4 overall picks, but with a massive 7 compensatory picks, they will pick 11 times total in the draft. While, obviously, it's better for the 49ers to have higher picks, this draft will likely serve their needs. As I mentioned, they have most of their stars locked up. What they need is depth, and that's what they are hoping this draft class, with its many 3rd and 5th round picks, will be able to provide. It would be great if they could find a late-round steal like Tariq Woolen, but even without someone like that, this draft could be very beneficial for the 49ers as a whole. Expect them to target mainly **Defensive Backs**, **Offensive Linemen**, **Defensive Linemen**, and a **Kicker**, with possibly a **Wide Receiver** or even a late-round **Quarterback**.

Another note: The 49ers currently have pick number 255, just 4 above Mr. Irrelevant. Maybe they should trade back. Couldn't hurt.

##A Special Note on the 49ers Quarterback Situation

The most important part of the 49ers offseason, and doubtless the most talked about, is answering the following question: **What the hell are they going to do at QB?** I'm here to tell you that there is a very easy answer to this question. It was always the obvious answer, and it became even more obvious when we learned that Purdy would not likely be ready for training camp. And that answer is:

###Keep Purdy and Lance, Sign a (non-starter) Vet, and have a QB competition with Lance getting first-team reps in training camp

Even before Purdy's injury, this was the obvious solution unless Purdy won the whole dang Super Bowl. Yes, hold your rage - I am in fact saying that *Lance*, not Purdy, should get the first-team minutes, at least in training camp and in the preseason.

Why? Because Trey Lance has all the prototypical qualities of the QB of the future, was brought to be the QB of the future, and has not yet shown that he is not the QB of the future. There is one thing Lance needs, more than anything else, before he can succeed in the NFL - he needs reps. Badly. He needs to play lots and lots of football and improve his touch and his feel for the game. And the 49ers need Lance to play as well - they need information. Lance's 5th-year option is coming up, and the 49ers need to know what they have in Lance in order to decide whether or not to sign him or whether or not to cut bait.

Purdy, meanwhile, has a different set of needs and expectations. He got plenty of reps with the first team - against real live NFL competition. What he needs, more than anything, is a full offseason to get stuff schemed up for him and work with the 49ers coaching staff to iron out his kinks. He won't quite get that training, now, but he can still participate by working on his body, making sure his arm is fully healthy and ready, and by becoming a master of Shanahan's system.

Doing it this way solves another issue for the 49ers as well, even if it turns out Purdy really is the next Tom Brady - by getting more film on Lance, the 49ers increase the chance that another team will send them back premium assets for the QB. If they try to trade him now, they'll get a very low return - they would be trading him at the low point of his value. Some tape that shows that he still has the promise he showed when the 49ers drafted him would entice another team to send more in return.

Obviously, the 49ers would prefer Purdy to be healthy for training camp, but the timeline of his injury just makes clear that this is the path forward. Lance will have the opportunity in training camp and in the preseason to prove himself. If he messes it up, Purdy will be there to take the reins, as before. And doing things this way still gives the 49ers flexibility with the cap, hopefully letting them sign players to fit around either of their potential franchise QBs.

(**POST-DARNOLD SIGNING UPDATE**: It sure seems like this is the path the 49ers are going down. Darnold isn't good enough that he is likely to beat out either Lance or Purdy for the starting job, but paying him $4.5 million is a solid move for a few reasons. First, he's good depth - we JUST dealt with needing 3 starting quality QBs and even that not being enough. Second, he has experience in the league as a starting player, which can help the young QBs learn. Third, he's insurance for if Purdy has a setback - or for the fourth scenario below. Fourth, apparently, Shanahan has wanted him for a while, so maybe - just as a flier - there's something in his mechanics Shanahan could fix to give us ANOTHER cheap starting-quality QB. That package is definitely worth $4.5 million, even if Darnold is not likely to seriously challenge Lance or Purdy for the main role.)

Of course, the team knows more than we do. We haven't seen enough of Lance to know whether he's a bust or whether he's on the cusp of realizing his potential - we, the fans, know very little. The 49ers probably know more. So while the path outlined above is clearly the best option if what we see is accurate, I'll outline a few other scenarios if the 49ers are internally convinced of certain things:

###If the Niners are Convinced Lance is a Bust: Trade Lance ASAP

I think this is pretty unlikely - after all, the 49ers were willing to go into last season with Lance as the QB1, and I can't imagine what has happened in the past season has convinced them beyond a shadow of a doubt that that trust was misplaced. That said, the last scenario has a caveat in it - I think it is more likely than not that Lance impresses in training camp and increases his value. If the Niners are convinced that that is not the case, and that Lance is well and truly a bust, they should act as soon as possible to try and maximize their chances of winning next season. If they can trade Lance for picks and get his cap space off the books, they would be more likely to fill their free agency holes with premium players or draft at higher positions to fill out the roster around Purdy. As well, it allows them to decide what to do depending on how they feel about Purdy - depending on whether they believe the next scenario or the last one.

###If the Niners are Convinced Purdy is a Superstar: Give Purdy the Reins, Keep Lance In Case He Gets Hurt (Or Stays Hurt)

I think this is also pretty unlikely. While the Niners certainly had plenty of time to get acquainted with Purdy and seemed to absolutely love him, flukes happen - and to commit this hard to a player who may not even be ready for week 1 is incredibly risky. But if the Niners are convinced that Purdy is Mr. Him Himmerson, then what happens to Lance doesn't matter as much any more. If the 49ers think Lance isn't a bust, but are committed to going forward with Purdy, they should hold on to Lance for this year and let him try to increase his trade value if Purdy gets hurt, especially if Lance ends up playing week 1. His highest trade value might be at the trade deadline if a team wants to try to do what the 49ers did in 2017 - get a potential franchise QB while the getting's good. In this scenario, Lance would be an ideal backup - a capable QB in his own right who teams would need to gameplan differently for - but while he should still get time with the first team in camp given Purdy's injury, the 49ers should dispense with the idea of a QB competition, at least internally, and make a commitment that Purdy is the guy.

Of course, that leaves the most chaotic scenario:

###If the Niners are Convinced Lance is a Bust And Think That Purdy is a Fluke

This is, I think, the least likely of all of the scenarios, for the reasons I've mentioned before. But what if, for whatever reason, the 49ers believe that the QB of the future is neither of the QBs on their roster? This is where we start talking about Lamar Jackson or Aaron Rodgers, or hell - I've heard Jimmy Garoppolo is available and knows the system well. The issues with this scenario, of course, are plentiful - primarily the fact that any of these options would cost the 49ers dearly. Signing Garoppolo would be the cheapest, but will likely mean giving up on other top-tier free agents. Signing Jackson - even assuming the 49ers can somehow get a first-round pick next year - would cost them even more draft capital and completely foreclose any other free agents, and trading for Rodgers would be just as costly. For this path to make sense, the 49ers would have to be pretty dang sure that neither Purdy nor Lance is the answer because of what they'd have to give up to make it happen. But this is a win-now team, and if they truly think this is the case, any of those players would give the 49ers the best chance to win, now. It would just be forfeiting the chance to win later as well.

So with all that, I think the move for the 49ers is both the most obvious, the easiest, and the least chaotic. They have two QBs who are, at once, potential stars and potential non-starters. One or both of them likely have the capability to be good or better starting QBs in the future. The 49ers should be focused this offseason on figuring out which one it is - and despite the internet's conviction that it's Purdy's job to lose, figuring that out will *require* giving Lance his fair shot as well. If Purdy wasn't hurt, there would be the temptation to stick with Purdy. But given the injury, there's one option here that seems clearly better than the others, and I'd bet a LOT of money that it's the one the 49ers are going to take.

#Final Thoughts and why you should root for the 49ers

So, let's say you're a football fan, and you find yourself without a team to root for. Maybe there's no local team, or maybe you're new to the game (unlikely if you're reading this post and have made it this far), or maybe you're a Browns fan. Why should the 49ers be the team that captures your attention and favor? Honestly, this might be one of the easiest teams to do this for. Let me list some reasons:

* **You like winning.** And who doesn't, really? If you're reading this post, and you're actively looking for a team to root for, chances are you have a bit of the ol' fair weather in you. I don't blame you one bit! Honestly, the hate for fair weather fans gets on my nerves. People can have other interests and things to do! But if you're in that position, you probably want a team that will make you happy and that has a good chance to be playing well into January and maybe even into February in high-stakes, critical games.

    The 49ers are very likely to be such a team next year. There's certainly the potential for failure - they could have injury luck as bad as 2020, or the QB situation could be a disaster, but this is a team with legit Super Bowl aspirations. With the way last season ended, they're hungry to get back to the top, and personally I'd take the over on whatever their win total is predicted to be.

* **You like stars.** The 49ers are full of big-name talent. They have many players at the top of their position in the entire league, and it's just fun to watch stars do star shit. You can watch CMC burn linebackers in the slot for big pickups on third down. Deebo Samuel just get the ball and make people miss. George Kittle apply his real-life truck stick. Trent Williams pancake big, strong men. Fred Warner fly around the field staying with wide receivers. Nick Bosa eat opposing QBs alive. Nick Bosa literally eat opposing QBs alive. Nick Bosa unhinge his jaw like a snake and swallow the opposing QB, roaring in triumph as the QB is devoured and offered to the Old Gods. Nick Bosa raise his head to the sky as his eyes turn blood-red and he chants the low, guttural deep speech, using the opposing QB as a sacrifice to summon the Old God of Pass Rushing who hates all humanity and will scour clean our worthless existence which offends him. Nick Bosa being flagged for 15 yards for roughing the passer for all of this because the NFL is a game for WIMPS. WIMPS I tell you.

* **You like high-powered, dynamic, unique offense.** Kyle Shanahan's offense is an absolute joy for football fans to watch. With so many versatile stars at the skill positions, so much motion, and so much clever scheming, you never know what's coming at you. All that star stuff I mentioned is in the cards, but the Niners also have offensive weapons like Elijah Mitchell and Brandon Aiyuk who could have big years with all the attention on CMC, Deebo, and Kittle.

* **You like bruising, fast, physical defense.** The defense should be plenty of fun to watch too. Have you heard that opposing teams were 0-15 the week after they played the 49ers? This is a strong, physical defense but one that doesn't lack for speed either. It was the number 1 unit in the league last year, and while we will see how much it will be affected by free agency, it should be a standout unit again.

* **You like drama.** Hey, have you heard about the 49ers quarterback situation? Well, you will! Whoever the starter is, expect numerous think pieces about how it's the wrong decision. Whenever the starter has a bad game, expect loud clamoring for the other one to replace him. If you're a normal person, that's probably a detraction, but if you're a well-seasoned drama fiend, it will be excellent. So much content!

* **You like great art.** Whatever happens, we have got / the Rita Oak, and they have not.

Overall, what is my expectation for next year? Well, as you can tell, there was PLENTY to talk about this year for the 49ers, and they were quite good. Next year, I expect there to be plenty to talk about for the 49ers, and I expect them to be quite good. Unless the 49ers really are cursed at QB (or CB), I wouldn't be surprised if this team is holding the Vince Lombardi trophy next year after such a brutal end to this season. I also wouldn't be surprised if there was another brutal loss in the playoffs (they've been quite adept at those since 2010), or a year where everyone gets hurt and the team struggles to be competitive. Every possibility is open for what will undoubtedly be one of football's most fascinating teams.",ToparBull,128,414,0.91

Everyone who matters wants Aaron Rodgers as the quarterback for the New York Jets in 2023. Everyone in the world knows this. The Green Bay Packers know this.

There is immense pressure on the decision-makers in New York to have Aaron Rodgers as their quarterback in 2023. If Aaron Rodgers is not their quarterback in 2023 there will be hell to pay from fans, players, the media, and ownership. Not getting Aaron Rodgers will be the seminal moment of the careers of Joe Douglas and Robert Saleh and they will no longer be employed by the New York Jets.

The Jets need Aaron Rodgers to be their quarterback in 2023.

The Packers do not need to do anything with Aaron Rodgers. He was never in their 2023 plans. If they do not trade him he will merely retire or be asked to leave the team. Sure, they would be down a few picks, but again, those picks were never in the plan for 2023.

The Packers have all of the leverage. They can wait as long as they want for the right package and if they do not get the right package they do not need to accept.

&#x200B;

The Jets have no leverage. Aaron has no leverage. The Packers have all of the leverage.",Sad_Sweet_3410,202,0,0.24

55,[Rapoport] It's the Kadarius Toney pick from the #Giants for Waller. Pick No. 100.,11re619,https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1635709248842629127?s=20,legobowser,296,893,0.97
56,Is the “Sacksonville” squad (2017 Jaguars) the worst team to have its own Wikipedia article?,11t0tow,"the Myles Jack news lead me to finding a Wiki article for the 2017 Jags team. I totally understand the use of articles for teams like the ‘85 Bears or No Fly Zone Broncos which were historically great AND won Super Bowls. Or even teams like the Purple People Eaters that didn’t win a Super Bowl but we’re really good for several seasons (they made 3 SBs in 4 seasons)

But the Sacksonville one is…sad. I’m not trying to pick on Jags fans but the team didn’t even make the Super Bowl (though I know that they were very close). This is my favorite line:

> The nickname derived from the high number of sacks tallied by the defense (55), which was second only to the Pittsburgh Steelers, who accumulated 56 sacks.


I don’t mean to be the Wikipedia police but are we sure this team is good enough to justify its own Wiki page?

57,[Discussion] Do you think there’s a possibility that the holdup on Lamar’s contract is more about the security of a long term contract more-so than guarantees per year?,11rdjrc,"Recap of what we’ve learned from Lamar today:

A.) The 200 mil guaranteed deal is a lie, indicating he’d likely accept that.(🧢 as Lamar put it)

B.) The Ravens have offered him a 3 year, 150 million dollar deal with 44 million guaranteed per year.

In the event Lamar’s style of play doesn’t hold up in 3 years, he knows he’ll get 2 more years of guarantees on a 5 year than a 3 year.

On the Ravens end, they look at Newton, Vick, and Kap, all run style qb’s with amazing results by 26, and the track record isn’t good for them. All significantly regressed/out of the league by 30(Kap due to different circumstances, but likely would’ve regardless)

Tl;Dr: I believe the Ravens don’t want a potential long term cap trap, Lamar wants insurance in the event of regression.

Do you believe that this may not be just an issue of guarantees, but about the years on the deal? Why or why not?",CyborgAlgoInvestor,114,44,0.65

60,Do players have to agree to restructures?,11r4vtx,"Argument with my buddies. 

I’ve read that when teams execute a “simple restructure” of a players contract, no action or involvement with said player is necessary.

My friends are saying that is BS, and that players are involved with it every time. 

The only source I could find is this 

https://overthecap.com/restructure#:~:text=Maximum%20restructures%20are%20typically%20considered,the%20player's%20consent%20to%20execute",Kwilos,74,52,0.78
61,Has There Been a Devaluation of the RB Market?,11siugi,"The RB position has always been considered one of the most expendable in the NFL, which has a direct impact on the market for top running backs. Nevertheless, from my understanding, 2023 free agency seems to be a cheap class based on the deals I've seen so far. Miles Sanders for $6.25M per year, David Montgomery for $6M per year, Jamaal Williams for $4M per year. Am I correct to believe that these are cheap deals relative to previous market expectations (especially considering the expanding salary cap), or did I simply not have enough awareness of general RB salaries? If my observation is correct, what are the factors that have contributed to this trend?",relevantpronoun,108,0,0.4
62,"By releasing Calais Campbell, not re-signing Ben Powers and Josh Oliver, and giving Lamar the Non-Exclusive tag over the exclusive tag, the Baltimore Ravens are officially 4.037 million under the cap.",11qoy62,"All things considered. Ravens GM Eric Decosta maneuvered around an extremely tough situation beautifully. 

Overall the Ravens didn’t lose much at all, considering the circumstances.

63,Free Agency Day 1 Winners and Losers,11qtrhv,"The annual “way too early to grade offseasons but we want to discuss what happened today” thread.

I’ll say overall Bears were slight winners. Broncos had the biggest action but overall went lateral. Eagles were slight losers. Browns were big losers.

49ers and Chiefs made the biggest moves in terms of Super Bowl contention next season, even if they weren’t the most active.

Jets aren’t losers yet but will be if Rodgers retires.",superduperm1,347,152,0.74

66,The 1998 Super Bowl winning Denver Broncos only had 1 player drafted in the 1st round. 8/11 of the starters were drafted in the 6th round or lower.,11qrrn3,"John Elway was the only first round pick on offense.
  
A few other big names on offense 

Ed Mccafrey 3rd round pick 

Terrel Davis 6th round pick

Shannon Sharpe 7th round pick 

Rod Smith undrafted

67,Salary Cap restructure,11r42bq,"A number of times I've heard about certain players ""being restructure eligible"" but what determines it?

Is it a case similar to a rookie contract where you cannot enter into extension talks until the player is entering into the final yr of his rookie deal.

Or

Are there other factors involved...

As an Eagles fan I will look a specific contract & that is Jordan Mailata.

Entering into the 2021-22 season (one that at the end of which he'd be a Unrestricted FA) he signed effectively a 4 yr 16 mill per contract (could reach 20 per with performance bonuses)

As someone just with simple access to sites like overthecap & spotract.

Why couldn't he be restructured this year.


I understand that on  a basic level a restructure is converting non-gurranteed money into a signing bonus that allows the team to spread out the cap hit.

But why are only certain players in each year considered eligible for this form of restructure??",ausgmr,18,20,0.68

They scored just 4 points the entire rest of the way, and lost 126-118.",11vzwj2,"A Dejounte Murray pull-up jumper gave the Hawks a 114-108 lead with seven and a half minutes left in the game, a scoreline which then held for the next twenty seconds, before Romeo Langford was sent to the free throw line for San Antonio.

In the time that remained, the Hawks shot 2/15 from the field, scoring just 4 points, and giving up an 18-2 run which would see them lose 126-118.

Atlanta went 5 minutes and 42 seconds without scoring a single point (Dejounte Murray jump shot 7:30 4Q -> Clint Capela layup 1:48 4Q).

1,The Hawks are still ass despite the Synder's arrival. How much is their mediocrity is actually due to coaching?,11vzw9l,"McMillan rightfully got the can and one of the League's most respected coaches was brought in to turn their season around. Yet they're only 4-6 since Quin Snyder's arrival with one of the worst and humiliating losses of the season against the Spurs.

Since the NBA is widely considered a  player's League, how much blame should actually be laid on the coach's feet? Is it possible we're using coaching as a scapegoat for poor Roster Construction and lack of leadership from the Stars?",Nosalis2,26,3,0.67

11,The Denver Nuggets might need to trade Jamal Murray,11vz652,"BEFORE YOU RESPOND, please just read the post first because the title is not what you might assume!!!


Nikola Jokic is making the Nuggets look a lot better than they really are, and if they want to have any shot at winning the championship, they need to get some more pieces around Jokic. 


However, looking at their salary situation, that is going to be a problem. Denver is currently $35 million over the salary cap, and they may very well have the worst contract in the NBA right now with Michael Porter Jr. Right now he’s in the first year of a 5 yr/$180mil deal that he’s on until the end of the 2027 season. I say this because while he’s an elite shooter, he provides little to no value in just about every other aspect of the game. He’s an adequate rebounder, maybe, but he’s a cone on defense and provides zero playmaking ability. He’s essentially a black hole on offense and a non factor on defense, and he’ll be making $180 million through 2027. I didn't even mention him being injury prone too. Not great.


Now if we take a look at their other pieces, the players that fit well with Jokic that Denver should absolutely not look to trade (if they can avoid it) are Aaron Gordon, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Bruce Brown. They all provide defensive value, can stretch the floor, and don’t need the ball in their hands to be effective. Outside of those 3 guys, the only tradeable pieces of some value that Denver has are Jeff Green, Ish Smith, Thomas Bryant, Zeke Nnaji… not really enough to get Jokic any legitimate help.


Now Denver obviously could package either 2 or 3 of the aforementioned players (Gordon, Brown, KCP) in order to find another star to pair with Jokic, but that would gut their defense and depth even further than it already is. And since the MPJ contract is one that I don’t think any other GM would be willing to touch, and Denver can’t do anything in free agency in terms of really bringing Jokic more help, Jamal Murray seems to be the odd man out here.


Murray had a great run in the 2020 bubble, but outside of then he’s mostly just been looking like an above average starting combo guard. He can create well enough for himself off the dribble, shoot pretty well, and provides some playmaking value, which could make him an enticing option for some teams, although the $160mil contract he’s currently on isn’t exactly team friendly either. I haven’t gone through a rundown of every team to find the one(s) that would bring back the most value, or that would even accept a trade for Murray, but given Denver’s options if they want to compete for and win a championship, it seems like pretty much the only way that they can go. Do you guys agree?


TLDR: Denver is in contract hell with the shitty MPJ contract and they’re way over the cap so they can’t do anything to get Jokic more help in FA, so presumably the only way they can get Jokic more help to compete for a title w/o gutting their defense and depth is trading Jamal Murray.",C-DogDriver,41,0,0.25

Not stuff like taking Giannis first overall when that was never a possibility at the time.

Like an example for the Sixers is they drafted Mikal Bridges in the lottery and traded him on the same day and/or Fultz not having a bizarre injury as the number 1 overall pick and/or letting Jimmy walk for Tobias Harris and Al Horford (ugh).  Obviously the butterfly effect would drastically change how the team operated if any of these came to pass but the Sixers werent that far away from:

PG: Harden

SG: Fultz

SF: Butler/Bridges

PF: Bridges/Butler

Talking about Kenny Smith from Inside the NBA. While he was never a superstar level player, he put up decent numbers and would probably be a starting guard  on a lot of teams in his prime. Would constantly get above 40 percent from 3 point shooting too.  

He averaged 17.7 ppg, 7.1 ast and 2.1 rebounds in his best statistical year which was his 6th season.

He was also able to average a similar stat line his sophomore season. 

I feel like he would have had a massive contract if it was negotiated after his 4th or 6th season, just going off the consistency and potential.

Beyond the stat line he was able to co exist with a superstar player like Hakeem and was able to bring out the best in each other. Valuable trait to have for teams that built around a star.",Aktor56,17,8,0.76

But, if Wembanyama is still under contract, would his drafting team have to pay a transfer fee to Metropolitans 92? This phenomenon is not unheard of in other European sports. For example, when Cristiano Ronaldo went from Manchester United to Real Madrid, Real Madrid paid his former club 80M euros.

36,(O.C.) All the players who've been the best player on a championship going back 1969,11vrl05,"I think this is one of the true lists in this sport. It happens quite often where the guy who won MVP seems like the best player in the league, but then it's the guy who brought home the ring who really gets that praise. Giannis for instance, after the playoff exit in 2020 was getting widely slammed despite being a back to back mvp but, upon winning the ring in 2021, he became the top dog. Only 5 active players have done that. and the list of active nba players who've been the best player on a finals team but not win the ring isn't too long either. (Tatum, Booker, Jimmy Butler, and if you want you can include Dwight Howard since he's technically still playing basketball).

So let's list them I'll put the first year they did it, which should help for multiple time winners. I'll be starting from the latest.

**Any miscalculations here**

Let me explain any ""controversial"" picks I made in the making of the list here.  I am putting David Robinson as the best player on the 1999 Spurs as Duncan was still young, but I genuinely am unsure and will trust a random spurs fan on here if they say otherwise. I also have heard that Joe Dumars was up there with Isiah Thomas for those late 80s Pistons teams. and I think you can make the point for either Ben Wallace or Chauncey Billups for the 04 Pistons.

Also, I should note that I put Magic's first year as the best player on the champion lakers as 82. I wasn't sure if there was a solid argument for Kareem that year. I know for a fact Kareem was better in 1980. I am also putting Moses Malone, not Dr J as the best player on philly in 1983.

I'm not an expert on 70s basketball. I had trouble finding much about the 1979 Sonics, but Dennis Johnson seemed to have the superior accolades. I may have overrated Dave Cowens and maybe should have put havlicek in 1974 but cowens was the mvp in 1973 and John was older at that time so I made some assumptions.  Also, because I'm stopping at 1969, players who lead their teams to victory before that year(namely, Wilt and Bill Russell) will be getting credit at the first point in the timeline.

&#x200B;

Hope that all makes sense.

**The Actual List**

&#x200B;

2021: Giannis

2019 Kawhi Leonard

2017: KD

2015: Steph Curry

2012: Lebron James

2011: Dirk

2009 Kobe

2008: Kevin Garnet

2006: D-Wade

2004: Ben Wallace or Chauncey Billups

2000: Shaq

1999: Tim Duncan

1994: Hakeem

1991: Michael Jordan

1989 Isiah Thomas

1983: Moses Malone

1982: Magic Johnson

1981: Larry Bird

1979: Dennis Johnson

1978: Wes Unseld(or Elvin Hayes OR Bob Dandridge) 

1977: Bill Walton

1975: Rick Barry

1974: Dave Cowens(or Havlicek)

1972: Wilt Chamberlain(or Jerry West?) 

1971: Kareem Abdul-Jabar

1970: Willis Reed

1969: Bill Russell.

Edits: took out David Robinson for 1999 and  Joe Dumars for 1989. added in some other options for several teams in the 70s.  thanks u/[**bonziwellsayo**](https://www.reddit.com/user/bonziwellsayo/)**,** for that suggestion.   
 

&#x200B;

In total, that's about 27 unique players over a 54 year span, with the 70s having the most names with 8  unique mvps. where as the 2000s(the second highest) had 6 unique MVPS and the 80s and 90s had only 4 unique MVPS.

&#x200B;

If you cut it off at 1980, you get a pretty even average of a new best player on a finals team emerging 5 times per decade. and it's been 2 years since Giannis did it for the first time. Maybe this is a sign a new player will do it this year?

&#x200B;

of the 27 players only 6 never won an MVP award. The ones who didn't are Kawhi Leonard, whoever you pick from the 04 Pistons, Isiah Thomas, Dennis Johnson, and Rick Barry.

&#x200B;

Players who HAVE won MVP but are not, as of right now, on that list: Nikola Jokic(2020-21-2021-22), James Harden(2017-18), Russell Westbrook(2016-17) , Steve Nash (2004-05, 2005-06), Allen Iverson(2000-01)  Karl Malone(1996-97, 1998-1999) David Robinson (1994-95), Charles Barkley(1992-1993) Julius Erving(1980-81) and Bob mcadoo(1974-75). Note though that Dr. J and David Robinson did win a ring as a top 2 option on the team, unlike others on this list so i don't think they should count in the same way. 

&#x200B;

In compiling this I used [this list of previous finals MVPS](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/finals_mvp.html) and cross referenced it with a list of mvps from the same source (bball ref), and would clarify with wikipedia and LandofBasketball to be sure i was picking the right guy.

37,"De, Aaron Fox's game resemble Manu Ginobili + Nick Van Exel?",11vr76c,"I was thinking about Fox's crazy euro step move on Kuzma from last night's game, wondering where I had seen that before, and I just got reminded about it. Manu Ginobili. Did a quick search and came across this:

(League average, for comparison, is 54.6.) Among the players who have the most half-court matchups against All-Stars, Brooks is allowing the lowest percentage. In short, he has matched up against All-Stars more than any other NBA player, and he has defended them better than anybody else. Just one player - Lillard - has scored 40 against him this year.

We tend to cite “pace and space” as the reason for the league’s scoring spike, but that wouldn’t explain the recent jump in FT%. The league FT% has been fairly steady for decades but it’s spiked recently.

There could be several factors for this —

— teams are playing fewer “bigs,” who traditionally aren’t good free throw shooters. They’re also running the offense through the post less often, which may mean fewer FT attempts for the big dudes who are still there.

— the league-wide emphasis on shooting may mean the perimeter players (guards and forwards) are better shooters than the past. We don’t see many defensive specialists anymore, or even traditional point guards who aren’t shooters (like a Rajon Rondo type.)",ZandrickEllison,31,121,0.95

After tonights win, the Sacramento Kings are only 4 games behind from the #1 Seed Nuggets in the East, with the final game of the season being Kings vs Nuggets on April 9th. Could Could the Kings win the West?

It certainly seems possible when we look at the remaining schedule for both teams.

Kings play:

* Jazz x 2
* Suns
* TWolves
* Trail Blazers x 2
* Pelicans
* Warriors
* Celtics
* Spurs
* Mavs
* Nuggets

The Kings Strength of Schedule is: 0.498 (source: [https://www.tankathon.com/remaining\_schedule\_strength](https://www.tankathon.com/remaining_schedule_strength))

The Nuggets play:

* Wizards
* 76ers
* Suns x 2
* Rockets
* Jazz
* Nets
* Bucks
* Pelicans
* Warriors

The Nuggets Strength of schedule is: .529. (source: [https://www.tankathon.com/remaining\_schedule\_strength](https://www.tankathon.com/remaining_schedule_strength))

It may very well come down to the final game of the season where the Kings have the chance to end the season with a BEAM and #1 Seed.

67,is it legal to offer a upper mid tier free agent a huge one year contract (well worth their value) with the caveat of signing a minimum the next year?,11vcap8,"



Let’s say your team (mid/large market) has a summer where a max slot (however it may cost in any given year) frees up, but no big stars are available, but, the next year - multiple top 5 players are - however, there are quite a few decent starters (like we’re talking B- to C tier dudes who are great contributes, think of guys worth 10/20 mil, for example. These guys can’t lead a team, but they’re very solid contributors. However, if you sign them to multi year deals - you lose out on your max slot. 


Now, what i want to ask if the following would be legal:

Let’s say you offer two of these players, who are normally worth 10-20mil each a huge one year contract. Ex. Two one year 30mil to them, and mention that they intend to sign a big star the next year, however, if you wish to win the championship, you must sign the minimum the next season. You don’t have to sign, you can even turn this down if another team pays you more, but just know that this is the only condition i would have to give you this large overpay for one year. 


Is such a thing legal? or would it count as tampering? you’re not giving them money under the table per say, you also aren’t making them commit to the min the next year and are basically giving the player to go to another team in the next summer if they so wish.

Of course I'm aware KD isn't on the team anymore, but Warriors crush at home with everyone scoring, a decent rotation of players, tough shots being made, etc....

It's the exact opposite on the road, they can't figure out a rotation, some players are good and others aren't, and they may even struggle with simple shots

To be fair, I've only seen the games this season, but I mean these guys are last years champions with minimal roster changes. Shouldn't they be a lot more dominant? What does this mean if a team is only good at home while being lackluster on the road?",throwaway4513786,62,31,0.71

Road: 7-29

What do I even say anymore? They have the 3rd worst road record and the 3rd best home record.

Early in the season it could be written off as them simply having bad luck, or missing shots, etc. At this point is it fair to say these are essentially two different teams? If this is the case, without home court advantage in any series, what are the odds we see them bounced in the first round in 5-6? 

Furthermore, with the West play in race being so tight, it’s plausible they end up the 8 seed or worse the 9 seed and potentially have to play one of the games on the road. Many have already pencilled in the Warriors as a playoff team, but with a rough schedule and plenty of road games left, there’s absolutely no guarantee they stay afloat. 

All this to say, if the Warriors miss the playoffs, or they get bounced early in an uncompetitive series, will we see this core broken up in the offseason?",william4534,51,351,0.95

104,Jakob Poeltl: The Most Underrated Center in the League,11v7yb6," 

I'm here to make a case for why Jakob Poeltl is the most valuable center in the league and how he can help the Raptors return to championship contention.

First off, let's take a look at his stats. Poeltl is averaging 9.4 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks per game this season. While those numbers may not jump off the page, he's doing it all while shooting a remarkable 65.7% from the field. That's second-best in the league among centers with at least 5 field goal attempts per game, behind only Rudy Gobert.

But it's not just his efficiency that makes him valuable. Poeltl is an elite rim protector, ranking fourth in the league in blocks per game. He alters shots and forces opponents to alter their game plan when attacking the basket.

But where Poeltl really shines is in his ability to set screens and roll to the rim. He's an excellent pick-and-roll player, and his ability to finish at the rim makes him a perfect fit for the modern NBA. He's currently averaging 1.34 points per roll, which is fourth-best in the league among centers with at least 3 rolls per game.

Now, I know what some of you are thinking. ""But what about Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokic? They're the best centers in the league!"" And while they're certainly great players, I would argue that Poeltl is more valuable to his team than either of them.

The Raptors have struggled this season, but Poeltl has been a bright spot. When he's on the court, the team has a net rating of +2.1. When he's off the court, that drops to -4.9. That's a massive swing, and it shows just how important he is to the team's success.

But the real reason why Poeltl is so valuable is because of his contract. He's currently making just $8.3 million per year, which is a bargain for a player of his caliber. With his current contract, the Raptors have the flexibility to add more talent around him and Pascal Siakam this offseason.

Jakob Poeltl is the most underrated center in the league. He's an elite rim protector, an excellent pick-and-roll player, and he's doing it all while shooting an absurdly high percentage from the field. He's also incredibly valuable to the Raptors, and his team-friendly contract gives them the flexibility they need to build a championship contender. Don't sleep on Poeltl, he's a future All-Star in the making.",SpicaComeBack,37,0,0.42
105,"The Sixers just played their 9th game in March ... Joel Embiid scored 325 POINTS in 303 MINUTES, through those 9 games! That's a franchise record 9 STRAIGHT games of 30+ Points for him and 8 STRAIGHT WINS ... He SAT OUT the entire 4th Quarter in 4 of them",11v7pjl,"[Source -- Brock Landes](https://twitter.com/LandesBrock/status/1637262289664393219) That's an amazing stat, Joel has sat out the 4th quarter ion four of the Sixers last nine games.

But their current team looks primed to be one of the leading contenders of the East and frankly the title.

The West is looking kind of weak at the moment and a betting man would favor a champion from the East. Of the three main contenders (Sixers, Bucks and Celtics), Embiid may be having the strongest season of any player.

122,Why have the Bucks been so much better than last season regular season wise?,11v578q,"This Season with 12 games to go, the Bucks have already won 50 games and will likely be the 1 seed.

Last season the Bucks won just 51 games and got only the 3 seed.

Why have they been so much better this year in the regular season than last season? If I had to take a guess I would say because Brook Lopez has stayed healthy throughout this season unlike last season where he was out for most of the season.

Anyways why have the Bucks been much better this season in the regular season than last season?",Disastrous_Day_2166,35,16,0.71
123,[Discussion] Isn't it a bit strange to have zero teams with great point differentials?,11v4nun,"2019-20: Bucks had season avg of +10.1, and the Raptors, Celtics, Clippers were all over +6.0.

2020-21: Jazz had a +9.2 and the Clippers had a +6.2, with several others trailing close behind.

2021-22: Suns had a +7.5, Celtics had +7.3, and Warriors had +6.5.

This year: Zero teams above +6.0, and only two teams above +5.0 -- the Cavs at +5.6 and the Celtics at +5.4.

What do we think is the reason for this? League-wide parity? A lack of great teams or bottom teams? Interested to hear what people think.

132,Are the Denver Nuggets contenders or pretenders?,11v1knw,My gut says they're the latter even though I'm a big fan of Jokic. I just think they lack a real second star.

If they had like a Paul George or a Demar Derozan in addition to Jokic and Murray then I think they'd be a real threat. What do you all think?,RaiseLive1654,188,45,0.65

Pretty much everyone on the Clippers played fairly well today other than Westbrook. Even Morris who has been consistently horrible had a good game.

136,Worst award winning seasons from players in the last 25 years,11v16rw,"Who is the worst player to win each award in the span of 1998-2022? And I don't mean worst player in terms of career but worst seasons to win every major award. If you think 25 years is going too far back I'll try to include modern examples. Awards/honors to be omitted from this are all-defensive team, all-rookie team, stat leader titles like steals leader, all the character/community work awards, and All-Star Game MVP (b/c nobody gives a shit in the ASG)

Final disclaimer, **I'm not saying any of these players are bad because that's dumb to say that, I'm just comparing it to all other winners of the same award**

_______________________________

**MVP** - Karl Malone 98-99

This was the worst season in the given time frame pretty easily, MJ retired, lockout shortened, pace was slow as hell, no star player really stood out or had that great of a year. They had to give it to someone so they chose Malone. What's funny about this one is that Karl Malone's numbers were down than years prior, like this was his 10th highest season in PPG pretty sure. Other candidates would be Iverson in 01, Rose in 11, Nash in 05, Curry in 15 was kinda weak. Again great seasons but keep in mind it's compared to other MVPs

**FMVP** - Andre Iguodala 14-15

Not saying the man didn't deserve the award but come on, he was given it for being the most effective at stopping Lebron even though he still put up 36/13/9. Let's be honest, either Lebron or Steph should have won

**DPOY** - Marcus Camby 06-07

Should have been Duncan's, Camby is also the only retired DPOY never to be an all-star in his career. Other answers for this, and both of these will get shit, Kawhi's second DPOY in 2016 which should have been Draymond's, and Marcus Smart in 2022 which was questionable to say the least. I mean come on Gobert and Giannis were better defenders and he wasn't even the best defender on the team last finals (timelord)

**Sixth Man** - Jamal Crawford 2015-16

This one stuck out to me because 35 year old Crawford was absolutely not a better 6th man than someone like Iguodala. Not that it really matters but it was purely a reputation award or a name they associate with the trophy. Pretty sure he won it over Ginobili in another year too

**ROY** - Mike Miller 00/01

Respect to Mike Miller and everything but that draft was straight booty cheeks and Miller would average 12/4/2 on 29 minutes. But then again there is Malcolm Brogdon with 10/3/4 on 26 minutes in 2016-17, honestly take your pick

**Hustle Award** - Amir Johnson 17-18

Dumbass award lol but why Amir Johnson? I don't think even 6ers fans know

**Most Improved Player** - Alan Henderson 97-98

I'll be honest, I don't know who this guy is. He put up 14/6/1 and played for the Hawks. You can maybe say Monte Ellis in 06-07 putting up 17/3/4 on the Baron Davis Warriors. idk

**All-NBA First Team** - DeAndre Jordan 15-16

Another tough one because of course there wont be any bad players here but it's gotta be him or Marc Gasol in 14-15. DeAndre Jordan was a great player, one of the best defenders in the league (behind Draymond and Kawhi at that time but still), elite rebounder, elite rim protector, great at setting screens, highest FG% and efficiency at that time. But let's face it, it was a weak era for centers. People will say Joakim Noah but I remember each of these years and I'd put him ahead of DAJ or Gasol

**All-NBA Second Team** - Vin Baker 97-98

Baker was playing for the Sonics and was putting up 19/8/2, of course it was a great season but he was 11th in scoring and was competing with Shaq, Robinson, Webber, Mutombo, etc... at the same position. Maybe I'm being biased towards big names though in this case. Modern example? Uhhhhh... Julius Randle 2 years ago? Maybe Siakam in 2020. Again it's hard to say and I'm not trying to hate on these guys or anything, someone who knows more should comment if I'm off base

**All NBA-Third Team** - Eddie Jones 99-00

Put up 20/4/5 on the Hornets. Marbury the same year put up 22/3/8 on a bad Nets team, pretty empty stats. As you can gather it wasn't the strongest era for NBA talent. But modern examples again? Maybe Bogut in 2010, David Lee in 2013, Shaq in 2009

I don't really feel like doing all-defensive teams very much since I don't know how to judge defensive ability or whatever criteria. Knowing about different basketball players than your team was different up until 10 or so years ago because cable TV is all you had. Same for all-rookie teams, there isn't a way to compare players without it taking all day basically so I'll skip them. But here are some bonus awards for non-players:

**Coach of the Year**- Sam Mitchell 06-07

He was the coach of the Raptors who went 47-35 to make 3rd in conference that year, it was his only winning season on not that good of a team. Speaking of Raps coaches, Dwane Casey 17-18 is probably #2 for worst

**Executive of the Year** - Elgin Baylor 05-06

This one is tough because it was probably seen as a great year (47-35, 6th in conference) but Baylor is not fondly remembered as Clippers GM. They would go back to being >.500 the year after and he had only 2 winning seasons in 10 years, but the worst owner in NBA history was running the organization so how much can you blame Elgin. Other candidates are Masai Ujiri in for the 2013 Nuggets, great season but Morey should have won

**Western Conference Champion**: 2006 Mavericks

The West wins the title most of the time, it's crazy looking at finalists considering 16/25 have won and those who didn't were mostly repeat finalists. But I go with 06 Mavs for this one because of a comparably mediocre roster around Dirk and Dirk was still in his choker days. I'll talk more about this finals later but they were the worst interior D the Heat had faced and they didn't double Wade. But other acceptable answers for this are the 04 Lakers for being washed/chemistry issues, or 2021 Suns for last 10 years

**Eastern Conference Champion**: 2002 Nets

Honestly chose your pick between that or the 03 Nets, the East was just complete garbage and either team probably loses in the first round if they were in the West. In 03 they made it to the finals with a piping hot 49-33 record and they were coached by Byron Scott. Other answers for this would be 01 Sixers, 07 Cavs, 20 Heat

**NBA Champion** - 2006 Miami Heat

Ignoring all the controversy with the refs/calls in the final, this isn't that great of a roster. Sure you had Wade at his best and Shaq in his last prime year (put up 14/10/3 in the finals series however) but Haslem, Jason Williams, and Antoine Walker were the starters and washed up Zo, GP, Derek Anderson were depth. SVG was also fired 20 games in. It really is a shame how people will overlook Wade turning into MJ by going 35/8/4 because ""it was rigged"" despite it being a top 5 finals performance ever",lowercase-punishment,21,12,0.68
137,Which title in this century has the biggest asterisk?,11v10jo,"For any reason: questionable refereeing (fixed games), injuries, complete luck

Notable years:

2002- Lakers win a wcf against SAC that looked blatantly fixed

2006- DWade shoots more freethrows than the entire Mavs team

2012- Miami Heat get some very favorable refereeing against a baby Thunder team

2015- Okc, Memphis, and Rockets plagued by injuries so the west is wide open. Warriors face an injured Cavs team in the finals without Kyrie and Love

2016- Green is suspended in the finals

2017/18- Durant Warriors superteam rings

2019- Raptors beat Sixers with a lucky bounce game winner. Beat Warriors with no Kd and Klay get’s injured

2020- The infamous bubble (mickey mouse) playoffs 

2021- Bucks get a very luck break against the Nets when iron man Harden suddenly has an injured hamstring. Kyrie goes down after Nets are up big. Kd still nearly pulls off the upset but an inch saves the Bucks season and their coach’s career. 

2022- Warriors beat Den without MPJ and Murray. Beat Grizzlies without Ja then face a weak Mavs team that upset the Suns.",SlimReaper35_,111,0,0.15

""Perusing around @bball_ref and found that the #Suns have shot more FT's than their opponent 23 times in 70 games (33% of games).

That is fourth lowest in the league by percentage:""


[](https://imgur.com/63ATWCB.jpg)

Some interesting tidbits are the Lakers out shooting opponents at the free throw line 72% of the time! 

Also,  the Bucks which are towards the bottom of the league in free throw attempts per game end up outshooting their opponents in 51% of the games. I'd be really curious on the opponents that the bucks are regularly outshooting. Pretty sure most of them are playoff opponents.

I'm starting to think that free throw attempts per game is not really a good gauge on whether a team is receiving a fair whistle. I think first percentage of time out shooting an opponent/quality of opponent is a much better indicator.",Jesmer8490,40,30,0.79

144,Is Gary Harris’ 3 point shot back?,11uyk1b,"Gary Harris used to be a very good young player. He could shoot, make some plays, and defend. Unfortunately, starting in the 2018-19 season he went from a good shooter to mediocre. From 2015-16 to 2017-18 he shot 38.9% from 3, but could not reach 38% in any season out of his next 3. In those next 3 seasons he shot 33.7% from 3 and lost a lot of his value as a player. Now though, he looks like he may have found his shot again. In the last 2 seasons he is shooting 39.9% in 100 games. He’s been above 38% in both seasons and this season he is at 42.5%.

Just to be clear, I don’t think the 3 point shot is the only reason Gary Harris fell off the map. He’s dealt with a lot of injuries and his 2p% also fell off. However, I do think he can be a useful player in a good team’s rotation if he continues to shoot like this.

151,Trae Young over the past 36 games: 27.1/3.3/10.3 on 46/38/89 splits (60.5% TS),11uwspm,"Steph 
Luka 
Dame 

Those are the only PGs I could take over Trae. I honestly don’t see an argument for Ja, Fox, Garland, or Hali, just because Trae had a rough start to this season. 

27 and 10 on good efficiency doesn’t just grow on trees and Trae has basically been doing that since his 2nd year at 20 years old, and now he’s playing solid defense too. 

With Quin Snyder as his new coach, he’s 
27/4/9 on 48/41/90 so far after 9 games. 

And obviously we’ll see what happens in the playoffs but as long as the Hawks aren’t facing the Heat, even if they lose in round 1 I think Trae will bounce back from his performance last year. 

Next year we could see an MVP-like breakout season from Trae…

153,"De'Aaron ""I'm F**king Nice"" Fox - Game Icing Stats (with video)",11uw3oo,"We've all seen Fox's excellent 4th quarter and clutch time stats, but I was curious: how many times this year has he been the one to actually ice the game?

I have a bunch of grading and lesson planning to do, so instead I just spent an hour going back through game logs and highlight videos.

I looked at two categories:

* Fox Game Winners - Fox scores the go-ahead bucket, and that is the final points of the game (I kinda cheated on this for a couple of them). I also looked to see how many of these were buzzer-beaters.
* Fox Daggers - I defined these as any game where Fox hit the Kings' final field goal, followed by some Kings FTs because of intentional fouling.

Here are the results:

The King have won 26 games by a single digit margin this year. In those games...

Fox has **7 game winners** (again two are a slight stretch but I'm counting them), a whopping four (!!) of which were buzzer beaters. 

* 11/5 @ Orlando, he hits the [unforgettable logo buzzer-beater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu1OZ4M6Cjc) to win it 126-123
* 12/14 @ Toronto, he drives to the rim and draws the foul with 0:05, and goes 1-2 to put the Kings up 3. On the next possession Siakim hits the putback after a missed FVV three, so this one is kinda cheating, but Kings don't win in regulation without that free throw.
* 1/3 @ Utah, [he hits the driving layup as time expires](https://youtu.be/tKXRDPZijNs?t=435) (call on the floor was that he didn't get it off in time, overturned on review) to win 117-115 (this is after Markkanen draws the 3 shot foul with 16 seconds to go and hits all three to tie)
* 2/8 @ Houston, [he draws the three shot foul from *Eric Gordon as time expires and hits all three](https://youtu.be/qaSTT5rsxqM?t=409), to win 130-128
* 2/11 vs. Dallas, he gets to the FT line three times in the last 18 seconds of OT, going 6/6 to win 133-128 (you could call this a bit of a stretch, but the Kings needed every single one of those six points)
* 2/24 @ LAC [he hits the go-ahead 2-point pullup jumper at 0:36 in 2OT](https://youtu.be/IUqEYXRn4HA?t=445), after creating that possession by picking Mason Plumlee's pocket. These are the last points of the game. Honorable mention for [assisting Monk's insane game-tying 3](https://youtu.be/bWc_-_DIFXA?t=105) to force OT in the first place. Kings win 176-175
* And of course, just the other night in Chicago, he [pulls up for an ice cold 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBA0ZhkLc1E) as the buzzer sounds to win 117-114.

The thing that really stands out to me: 6/7 game winners are on the road, a huge reason for the Kings' conference best road record of 21-13.

In addition to the 7 game-winners, he hit another 3 daggers, which I define as times where he hit the Kings' final FG of the win, followed only by Kings FTs on intentional fouls.

* 11/11 @ LAL, he [drains a turnaround fadeaway 2](https://youtu.be/1CQTw5I1qz0?t=432) with 0:32 to go
* 11/20 vs. Detroit, [he hits the two-point stepback](https://youtu.be/pMKX1-7jqa4?t=422) with 0:56 to go
* 1/20 vs. OKC, [he hit a layup to ice the game at 0:01](https://youtu.be/WMwjbMqEdls?t=437) (the Kings were already up 3 at the time, but it ended a flurry of OKC scoring)

Honorable mention for [assisting Trey Lyle's game-sealing dunk](https://youtu.be/cmhnaZDiwC8?t=561) with 0:37 to go @ Minnesota on 1/30.

A lot will depend on matchups. Would I place money on Denver or SAC beating a healthy Lakers or Warriors team in the first round? Hell no. At the same time, either of those teams could luck into facing Minnesota or OKC in the first round.

I also think it makes for a more entertaining product to consume as an NBA fan. Imagine an and-1 poster become a 4 point play…that’s more exciting in my opinion. Lately, the league-wide focus on 3 point shot making has become pretty bland as a viewer.

35 points in a win against the Pelicans. 

Load-management in a loss against the Rockets. 

26 points and single-handedly organizing a 6-1 Maxi Klieber run with 8 seconds to go to gift the game to the Mavericks. 

He obviously can’t be the guy for your franchise. That’s embarrassing. 

Chuck and other old-heads call him “street clothes” and don’t give him the Giannis level of respect, because he is just soft. Lacking the winner’s mentality. 

12 games remaining with a chance to get the 6-7 seed? Nope - Anthony Davis just sat one game out and choked the other game away. 

Instead of being 36-35 and tied with the Warriors for the 6th seed, the Lakers are 34-37 in the 10th spot. 

LeBron chose the wrong superstar to team up with in Los Angeles.

178,"its time for the NBA to recognize they need to overhaul rules, refs and add more technology",11umvct,"I've always given NBA refs the benefit of the doubt. NBA players are big, fast and unbelievable athletic. It is tough to see every call let alone make the right call. 

But the refs have been abysmal this season.. I dont know what the solution is but from what I've seen this year, its time for a convo.

1) Consistency- They need to call the game according to the RULES. They called a travel on a Curry stepback yesterday that they rarely ever call. Its like the ref decided he didn't like Curry for one play. These players routinely travel and carry and the refs call it at their leisure. Gotta stop. 


2) Recognition of a foul- Hunter went up for a dunk last night and got hit 100% on the arm and ended up getting a tech. Ive seen this routinely all year long even when it helped my Hawks out. In fact, last night I saw multiple times where we body checked Curry and the ref called nothing. Blatent foul. Appreciate it this time refs. But enough is enough. When is a foul a foul every time?

3) Superstar calls. I recently saw an interview in which a player stated Kobe told him that "" you know they not calling a foul on me in the 4th quarter. "" The Shaq rules were another example. John Collins on our team gets hacked multiple times per game and they NEVER give him a whistle. He not a superstar.

180,Alex Caruso’s Defensive RAPTOR is the highest by a guard since the stat has been tracked,11umco0,"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Alex%20Caruso&season=2023

This season, Caruso’s DRAPTOR is +5.9, by far the highest in the league. The next closest is Anthony Davis at +5.2. 

Over the last nine seasons (the lifetime of the stat), only 3 guards crack the Top 30. 

Alex Caruso’s current season ranks 1st All-Time for guards, and 5th All-Time for all positions (1st and 2nd All-Time belong to Rudy Gobert) 

2nd place All-Time for guards again goes to Alex Caruso for the 2021-2022 season. 

3rd All-Time, and the only other guard in the Top 30 in DRAPTOR, is Tony Allen in the 2014-2015 season. Tony Allen was 33 at the time, so imo it’s very likely both him and Kobe Bryant would be the other guards near Caruso’s level if the stat covered all of the 2000s.

Since then, they have been alternating wins and losses in such a way that they have hit every single possible .500 record (ie 25-25, 26-26 etc.). Before that streak, they were also 22-22 and had a shorter streak of being 13-13, 14-14 up to 17-17.

He didn't have a traditional big to sit around and bang with so they put him on the worst guy because their tallest guy was a good three point shooter.

It’s been nearly 4 years since the all star forward was traded from the Toronto Raptors to the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard.

In the 2018-2019 season, Leonard went on to lead the Raptors to their first and only NBA title.

DeRozan left the Raptors as the all time leading scorer, but could never get the team over the hump in the postseason.

Since the trade in 2018, DeRozan has played for both the Spurs and the Bulls. He’s continued to play at an all star level, but his team(s) have not had success in the playoffs.

222,What’s next for the Pelicans?,11uc7mf,"They’ve been pretty horrific for the last 2-3 months, but they’ve hit rock bottom with a loss to the league-worst Rockets and their play-in chances look slimmer every day.

Basically every role player other than Trey Murphy (and Naji I guess) has regressed from last year. Zion has missed 2/3 of the season and a normal hamstring injury from January has dragged into something that might take him out the season. 

Even worse, it seems like they had a bright future before this season, but the season has been so poor even their future is questionable.

What’s next for them",legend023,51,24,0.88

224,Embiid in last 2 games vs Jokic: 41/14/5 on 68 TS%. Jokic: 23/11/9 on 68 TS%,11ubrka,"As much debate as there is about who is the best center in the league and who is MVP, I think there last 2 matchups have been interesting. Both have won one game a piece, but Embiid has outplayed Jokic H2H and visually looks like the better player with more dominant scoring and defense when they play each other. Embiid can defend and slow down Jokic much better than Jokic can defend Embiid.

In 7 games of his career vs Embiid, Jokic averages 22/8/7 on 60 TS%. Jokic is also 2-5 vs Embiid H2H. 

In 7 games vs Jokic, Embiid averages 26/12/4/2 on 57 TS%. Embiid is also 5-2 vs Jokic in his career. 

Their overall career matchups, shows Embiid outplays Jokic H2H and his team is also winning the matchup as well.

I started thinking about this after someone asked if Giannis on a 16 seed would win the title on the Bucks’ sub (the answer was a resounding yes). I’m curious how bad of a player (by nba standards) could theoretically pull this off.",ahkallday,64,0,0.49

Before this we had


Harden vs the world

Lebron vs KD

Shaq vs AI 

Lebron vs Kobe 



What players will be dueling it for MVP over the next few years?


Imo after this threesome i think Luka, Tatum, SGA will be having crazy races over the next few years",StormSaniWater,23,12,0.65

240,Finally it is clear to me. The secret to Steph Curry's success is that he never stopped shooting his little kid shot.,11u9kre,"I was always a bit confused by Wardell Stephen Curry II. He seems like a normal player, but he's the best shooter ever. Better than Bird, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen. But why? Usually you don't get to be the BOAT at something unless, beyond your determination, have some serious uncommon advantages. I was never sure what it was with him. But now I see. It's little kid power.

So... [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtYJTAsNmg), you can see Steph warming up with his Dad when he was a kid. Obviously, he's heaving the ball at the basket in one motion like you usually do when you're a kid and your forearm and wrist alone aren't strong enough to get the ball to the basket (and I guess you're shorter too and need more arc). 

I think for most of us, when we get to be around 14, we start shooting a normal ""adult"" two-motion shot, with just our arm. But now that I think about it, we really have to learn that shooting form from scratch at that age. So if you enter the NBA at 21, you have at most 7 years of reps with your jump shot.

But Steph Curry *never changed his form*. Apparently he started playing rec league games when he was 6-years-old. So when he went into the NBA, he actually had 15 years of reps. 8 extra years of practice.

On top of that, as we can see in the video, he was flinging NBA 3-pointers from the time he was a little kid too. When he was nowhere near strong enough in the arms to get it to the basket normally. So he learned to use his legs and arms in his shot to give extra power to his heave while not losing any control. Throwing the ball from beyond wrist-flick range is what he's ALWAYS been doing. It just so happened that when he got to be grown-man size, that same practice let him step back to 30-feet easily.

That is all. Maybe some of you already knew this. But I wanted to share anyway.",EGarrett,22,31,0.68
241,Moving Screens in the Paint,11u8ori,"These fake box outs that come way, way before the shot gets released need to be addressed, either by the rules committee or by making them a point of emphasis. There’s a lot of talk about the scoring explosion and what’s causing it, and I don’t think this gets brought up enough. The way games are called right now, bigs can seal the help defender and basically block them like an offensive lineman as their teammate takes the open layup. It’s a moving screen and it should be called. It’s gotten worse over the last few years but this year I feel like I’m seeing it on every drive.",jakehightower,11,27,0.85

These are the guys who never seemed to have the statistical case to get drafted, but had potential — terrible first roud picks like Skal Labissière (6pts/3reb at Kentucky, picked 28th and traded to the Kings) or Georgios Papagiannis (1.5pts/1.7reb at Panathinaikos before he went 13th to the Kings.).

269,Game #70 - Raptors vs Thunder: Post-Game Analysis,11tzxhz,"Hi r/NBA, I've mainly been using the r/torontoraptors sub to make these posts, mainly because this sub doesn't allow me to post individual pictures, but I think I've found bypass that through twitter pics. I'd like to test out one post here and see if you guys enjoy some in-depth analysis.

# Highlight of Game

Thankfully the Raptors made this one easy today:

[As Scottie is crossing the half you see him take a look back at Yak to signal to him to hustle up the floor. From the block to the no-look to the poster, this play felt like the Showtime Lakers.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/q1irc2keqboa1/player)

# Player of the Game 

I've been Pascal Siakam's biggest critic since the deadline, as he's had **4 games** where he's **scored 15 or less points** in March**,** having only 3 such games before this month.

He finally did a good job at reading the help defense, finishing with **25/14/8** with **4 threes.** Since the Raptors have been fully healthy, Siakam is the only starter with a **negative NET RTG.** He was a **+6** last night, playing a healthy **34 minutes** and being tagged with the responsibility of leading the bench. 

I had to give today's player of the game to **Pascal Siakam**. He needed this game, and I hope he's able to string along some good performances as we close the season out (or not and we win Wemby).

# How the game was put away

I thought the Raptors were always always in control of this game, holding a **9 point lead** until the **8 minute mark** of the 4th, where Scottie Barnes subbed back in and we simply put away the game, here are some plays that I thought contributed to it:

[Isaiah Joe tries to blow by Gary Trent Jr Twice, fails and takes a contested jumper.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/2ury9envtboa1/player)

I made a point that whether or not his offence is going, Gary needs to stay aggressive and effective defensively. The first time Joe drives Scottie is there to help in the paint while constantly looking at Giddey. This play also shows the presence of Yak presence defensively, the second time that Joe tried to drive, Poeltl sagged off his player to help Trent if Joe wanted to finish at the rim. 

When defended by Poeltl, attacking players shoot **37.6%** between **5-9 feet** so Joe technically did take a better shot, but this is still perfect defense by Trent Jr. Additionally, Poeltl contested a team-high **18 shots** and held opponents to a crazy **7/24** when defended by him.

[Scottie does a great job of recognizing the mismatch and sealing Shai down-low, if he postered Vucevic, I'm sorry Lu Dort you're getting postered too. ](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/xzwhf0lbwboa1/player)

Reddit only allows me 5 videos, so let me break this one down step-by-step:

* Scottie grabs and offensive rebound, gets the switch from Giddey to Shai
* Once Siakam gets the ball, they do a great job of moving the ball (and the Thunder do a great job rotating) to force the Thunder into more mismatches. 
* Both Fred and Gary had good shots that they usually take, but instead they find Poeltl on single coverage
* Scottie cuts to the basket, seals Shai (ref misses a foul with Shai wrapping his arms around Scottie)
* Easy dunk over Dort.

[Transition 3 and that's good night folks.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/9i73jlnuyboa1/player)

The Raptors get criticized a lot for help defense, deservedly so, but this is a perfect example of knowing when to help, and I want you to pay attention to Scottie Barnes' eyes defensively. As soon as Dort makes the pass his focus is on what Giddey is going to create.

Scottie realizes that Giddey has his head down and can only see the left side of the court, and comes over from the to help immediately. When Giddey spins, there's a surprise waiting for him. 

4 Thunder players collapse on Siakam in transition, and instead of forcing contact and trying to draw a foul, he uses the space to find Trent Jr , who shoots **40%** on **wide-open** **threes.**

These were the 3 plays that I thought put the game away but here are some other **4th quarter notes**:

* The Raptors held the Thunder to **0 field goals** for over a **4-minute stretch**
* We were **+7 on the glass** and **+16% shooting from the field** compared to them
* Siakam didn't force, he had **5 assists, 0 turnovers,** and only took **3 shots**
* Scottie and Poeltl dominated with **16/10/2** with **2 stocks**

# The Good, The Bad, No Ugly

I usually do 3 good things, 3 bad things, one ugly thing. But yesterday was genuinely one of the best games I've seen this team play and I really can't think of many bad things.

**5 Good Things**

1. Everyone chipped in. In 2020, the Raptors became the first team to have **5 or more players** average **15+ PPG** in a season. Well they did it again last year, and they're doing it again this year. They also did it last night, but instead had **6 players** who scored **15 points** or more. Poeltl has been averaging just under **15PPG** with the Raptors this year, so maybe they could become the first (?) team do have 6 players do it.
2. Nick Nurse did a great job of splitting Siakam and Scottie's minutes, which is something I know fans have been calling for. This season, they average over **29 MPG** together**,** and yesterday they only played **21 minutes** together, partly due to foul trouble with OG and Poeltl (it would've been closer to 17 minutes). Regardless I think it's key to split their minutes for spacing, specifically in single coverage isolations.
3. The Raptors are **2-0** since I've added the keys to the game section (I'll elaborate lol). After the game vs Denver I said the matchup between Scottie and OG vs Giddey and JDub  (Thunder fans, I absolutely love him, he's just about as good as OG was last year, be excited) is key. Scottie and OG: **37/12/7/1TO** on **14/24** from the **field,** **5 stocks** and a **+14** on the floor together. Giddey and JDub: **28/14/4/5TO** on **10/22** from the **field, 2 stocks,** and a **-9** on the floor together. All these players are awesome, and these two-man pairings will be key to these teams future success.
4. The Raptors dominated them on the glass and in transition. Outrebounding them by **20**, with **44 points in transition vs 19** for the Thunder. In addition **23 2nd chance PTs** to their **6.**
5. Scottie Barnes has absolutely been a mid-range monster in the Month of March, just take a look at his [shot chart](https://twitter.com/6ixin6ix_/status/1636753803822153728?s=46&t=qyM1qIw-Y3F7679x-MiQOw&fbclid=IwAR0tn_ZH0-htq3rCFnXDJYoKv9Dph5Le3PcCAP5GbNT5lL-oDZDzlo7PKaA). Here's a look at why he's dominating that right side mid-range:

[Please excuse the quality.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/jqtcqqwwbcoa1/player)

His length is problematic. Teams are used to him getting into the paint and going for a hook shot or fadeaway (like he did against Giddey in this clip) and they usually send help as he's been shooting **46%** on those shots from the free throw line range. His ability to create shots on islands where teams can't really help (without giving up a high quality shot off a pass) is going to be important for his offensive developments because teams can't double him on island iso's because of his playmaking ability.

**1 Bad Thing**

**One Ugly**

# One Sentence Review, One Sentence Preview

**Review**

I really hope this team isn't playing with my emotions by pretending to be good for a few days and then fall off a cliff and never reach .500 this season.

**Preview**

Rudy Gobert, you're about to be put in a pick and roll torture chamber pal. 

# 3 Keys to Minnesota 

1. Attack Rudy Gobert off mismatches. Opposing teams shoot **56%** in the paint against him (both RA and non-RA). Against the Thunder I said managing the two-man game between Poeltl and whoever is running the PnR is important. We outscored The Thunder **30-10** on **points off screens.**
2. More Christian Koloko. He has the Raptors highest **NET RTG** this year, and it always confused me why Nick removed him from the rotation when he was our only center. I think placing him in a backup role where he can keep the defensive intensity that Poeltl brings is key going forward. He contested **7 shots** in only **12 minutes** yesterday.
3. Contain the two-man game of Conley and Gobert through effective switching and help. In wins the two of them combine for **30 PPG shooting 60% from the field.**  Whereas in losses they combine for **21 PPG shooting 48% from the field.**",eLevateAFFN,17,98,0.92
270,"If Nikola Jokic averages a triple-double this year, it will be exactly as rare to average a triple-double in a season, as it is to average 2+ blocks and 2+ steals in a season",11tzk4u,"Nikola Jokic is currently averaging 9.9 assists per game. If that number increases just a tiny bit the rest of the season, he will average a triple-double on the season.

**Triple-double seasons:**

Russell Westbrook (x4)  
Oscar Robertson (x1)  
potentially Nikola Jokic (x1)  

**2+ block / 2+ steal seasons:**

Hakeem Olajuwon (x4)  
David Robinson (x1)  
Gerald Wallace (x1)  

The triple-double is a sign of extreme versatility, generally on offense. The 2blk / 2stl in many ways could be considered the defensive version of it. Should Nikola Jokic join Russ and Big O, each statistical feat would have one player who has done it exactly 4 times, two players that have done it exactly once, and nobody else in league history.

278,Is Brook Lopez the 3rd best center in the league?,11txewa,"Hello r/nba,

At the center position the two obvious top dogs are Embiid and Jokic. However who is 3rd, in your minds? Traditionally this would be KATs spot but he’s been hurt all year. This got me thinking, there’s Bam, Brook, AD?, and Sabonis (is he a center or PF?). 

Bam is another great defensive center who has a nice offensive game (especially the middy he’s developed). 

Sabonis is a jokic-lite type offensive hub but bad defensively. 

AD is clearly better but his position is unclear, he’s constantly hurt, and plays with inconsistent effort. 

Then there’s Brook. Who’s better defensively than Bam and Sabonis (Bam is close he’s just not as good a rim protector). On par with AD defensively. Plus he’s a far better outside shooter, has a nice float game, is a good screen setter; etc. 

Where would you guys rank him at his position? Am I crazy for ranking him this high?

Edit: I may be undervaluing Bam. 90% of the time I watch him his matchup is Joel Embiid, which basically never goes his way. I may be overvaluing brook based on how he plays Embiid, which is better than anyone in the league at the moment.",Fun-Pass-5651,114,0,0.35

But I don't get this knowledge. Warriors brought Donte Divencenzo who is much more respected role player than GP2 was and he is shooting career high from three, they brought Jamychal Green who is a better player than Bjelica and OPJ and also shooting career high from threes. Warriors brought the players that can be replacements and they still struggle defensively. For wiggins case, they lost to alot of tanking teams on the road even with Andrew Wiggins on the road.

So I think there is other reason than missing old players. Their role players are good enough to replace players from last year. Is there chemistry issue because how Draymond punched JP?

283,[Schaefer] Bulls' new starting lineup (when whole) of Beverley-LaVine-DeRozan-Caruso-Vučević has best net rating of 5-man units that have played at least 150 mins this season in the NBA,11tvz1i,">But since the All-Star break the Bulls have found a fruitful five-man formula that they are hoping will propel them to the play-in tournament — a revamped starting and closing lineup of Patrick Beverley (who signed from the buyout market in mid-February), Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, Alex Caruso and Nikola Vučević.

>Entering Friday's game against the Timberwolves, for which Caruso is questionable with an illness, that unit owns a 119.1 offensive rating, 95.5 defensive rating and plus-23.6 net rating across an admittedly small sample size of 155 minutes, according to NBA.com.

284,24 of 30 teams have won and lost four games in a row this season,11tv885,"Phil Jackson's teams, at least the good ones, were famous for rarely losing three in a row. Maybe it was Zen-like focus. Or MJ and Pippen, Kobe and Shaq, and Kobe and Pau. But if they dropped a couple in a row, they quickly got their shit together.

 The Bulls lost the first three games of the 1990-1991 season. They did not lose three in a row again until the 1993-1994 season.

After Phil Jackson assumed duties as coach of the Lakers in 1999, they did not lose three in a row until February 19, 2002.

The Lakers lost three in a row on January 27, 2008. They acquired Pau Gasol shortly thereafter and did not lose three in a row again until March 7, 2010.

During the 2022-2023 season, 24 of 30 teams have lost four games in a row AND won four games in a row. I used a four game metric as a sufficient sample size that seems above a temporarily little blip or brief exercise in competence. 

The only teams who have NOT won four games in a row AND lost four games in a row are the Celtics (have not lost four in a row, title contender), 76ers (have not lost four in a row, title contender with an MVP candidate) Rockets (have not won four in a row, tanking), Spurs (have not won four in a row, tanking), Pistons (have not won four in a row, tanking), and the Bulls (have not won four in a row, are a mess).

What conclusions can be drawn from this date? Evidence of the randomness of the three? Load management and stars not playing? Parity of the league? It seems very unusual that 80% of the league is good enough to win four in a row and terrible enough to lose four in a row.",EricHangingOut,21,47,0.93

\- As well as, the [2015-2016](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIA/2016.html) Heat with Chris Bosh, McRoberts (I liked to shoot with him in 2K, dunno why), Justice Winslow, Goran Dragic, Beno Udrich & Tyler Johnson.

Both teams aren't even close (Heat is 51.9 PPG together - over 20 points away, but a low total too).

I also remember the [Memphis Grizzlies](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MEM/2011.html) with Zach Randolph, Mike Conley, and Xabier Henry.

**Were there ever two left-handed players in a single team averaging 20+ PPG in the past?**

**The Knicks are pretty close to having three left-handed players who averaged 20+ PPG (Barrett 19.8 PPG, Randle 25.2 PPG & Brunson 23.8 PPG).**

People are gonna probably wonder why they're so high on the Cavs and low on the Bucks, here is the reasoning


> Since 1983-84, 36 of 39 champions have had a point differential of plus-4 per game or better—and this season, only the Celtics, Cavaliers, and Nuggets fit that criterion. If you’re wondering why the Cavaliers’ title odds look so strong here, that’s the main reason: They’re neck and neck with Boston for the best Pythagorean record in the NBA.


----

> Riding a 12-game winning streak, the Bucks are only half a game behind the Celtics for first place, but they have benefited from a league-best 22-6 record in “clutch” games—and there’s no correlation between clutch performance in the regular season versus the playoffs. The Bucks’ point differential is also just plus-3.2 per game, which ranks only fourth in the East. Since the playoff field expanded to 16 teams in 1983-84, only one team has won the title with a worse point differential: the sixth-seeded Rockets in 1994-95 (plus-2.1 points per game).",AbshirThePoet,110,19,0.64

306,How far away from the basket did Jerry West shoot most of his jumpers?,11tonse,"Jerry West is rightfully regarded as one of the best shooters to ever play the game. However, he never played with a three point line and it would be unfair to compare him to other great shooters  who played with the 3 point line. 

Among those who had the chance to watch him play live, heard stories from people who saw him play live, or watched several highlights of his, how far away from the basket did he usually pull up from? How good was his range?

&#x200B;

Did he attempt most of his jumpers from...

1) Demar DeRozan, CP3, SGA Range (free throw line area, on the elbows, around the painted area)

2) LaMarcus Aldridge Range (Top of the key, between the free throw and three point line)

3) Three-Point Range (The standard 3 point line distance in the NBA today)

Obviously you can argue that it's not the perfect formula but it clearly is a strong indicator of how good of a season a player had and whether MVP voters use it or it just happens to coincide with where the MVP votes go, it's hard to argue that the criteria keeps changing when this has been a very consistent indicator on who ends up winning MVP.

309,West Predictions,11tjjns,"As the East seems like it is very top heavy with the surging bucks, the still very good albeit sometimes limping Celtics, and a very strong sixes, the West seems WIDE open.

The nuggets for the most part seem like the best team in the conference from wire to wire, albeit with some losses strung together lately

Grizzlies, although in near the top, are without Morant for 9 games, it'll be interesting to see if chemistry is an issue or they slip from a top spot

The KINGS?!?! Talk about a Cinderella season, they could very well finish #2 or #3, and possibly make the world end by making it to the finals Ala the 2021 sun's (Ling playoff drought snapped,  followed by a run through the conference)

The Warriors are very jekyll and Hyde on the home vs road, but are hovering in that top 6 spot and do have the experience of long playoff runs

The Clippers seem inconsistent and can't string together too any wins together, but still hover in that top 6

The Sun's got KD, it's all a matter of making that chemistry work and surging to the top half of the conference 

There is a very real possibility we will see a first time finals appearance from a team coming out of the West. With about 10 games to go, who do you think can make it out and why?

Personally I wanna see the world end and the Kings make it",Fearless-Muffin,11,5,0.59
310,"Kawhi Leonard was first named an All-Star in 2016. Since 2016, he has been named All-NBA First Team 3 times. Kevin Durant has only been named All-NBA First team once in this time frame, the season Kawhi played 9 games. Why does Kawhi not get the credit KD does?",11tj50c,"Kawhi was also the DPOY in 2016, All-Defensive First Team twice, and All-Defensive Second Team three times.

When most people talk about the top players of this generation they bring up LeBron, Steph, Durant, and Giannis. Nothing wrong with those players but I often wonder why Kawhi’s name isn’t mentioned. Most people talk about Kawhi like he just takes it easy until the playoffs and then turns it on but clearly the voters think he has outperformed KD as a regular season player since he has become a star.

Here are their playoff stats from 2016 to now:

Kawhi (70 games): 28-8-4-2-1 62.9 ts%

KD (82 games): 30-7-4-1-1 61.1 ts%",xpillindaass,76,0,0.47
311,Why was Kareem not seen as a better player than Russell and Wilt in the past?,11tj0bi,"Up until somewhat recently (2010s ish) it was widely considered by fans and the media that both Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain were seen as greater players than Kareem Abdul Jabbar. Not saying it's wrong or right but now Kareem as top 3 is pretty unanimous around here 

What was the cause behind that? Was it because Kareem peaked in a weak era? Was it because of his playstyle that wasn't very flashy (other than the skyhook)? Was it his personality which rubbed a lot of the media the wrong way, or his politics? Why was Kareem slept on before",lowercase-punishment,63,11,0.65
312,"Asking for criteria in MVP voting shows you lack a basic understanding of what voting represents. Also, there should absolutely be a different narrative every year for MVP.",11tj0b5,"I don't understand what the criteria are for MVP anymore. Every time someone says this phrase I feel second-hand embarrassment. If we picked NBA MVP based on criteria we would just check all the necessary boxes and be done with it. Voting is redundant if we use criteria to decide something. The only criteria an NBA player has to fulfil to be an NBA MVP candidate is, well to play in the NBA.  

Voting always is, should and will be subjective, objective, and biased depending on the voter. There may be guidelines for voting but there cant be criteria. What are the criteria when voting for US President? You can't be serious and tell me that the last 4 presidents all checked the same boxes. What are the criteria when voting for Miss Universe or Eurosong or anything else that we vote on? Voting is not grading.

And every NBA season is a unique story that will never be told again. Different obstacles to overcome and different motivations for every single player and team. It's only logical that the narrative for MVP voting will be different.",Streptomicin,34,23,0.6

332,Nuggets home/away record,11tea1m,"Anyone else think the nuggets home vs away spread can be a huge vulnerability come playoff time? The altitude is a real thing. For example, at one point Air Force football (an hour south of Denver) had the 2nd longest home winning streak in all of college football. 

Granted, they have home field advantage but all the other team needs to do is win one in Denver and they are facing a nuggets team that until today had a losing record in away games.",Haunting-Worker-2301,34,0,0.43
333,The Sacramento Kings have secured their first winning season since 03-04 with a record of 42-27.,11te9yi,"They also:

- held the nets to 0 fast break or second chance points. A feat that hasn't been done since 2015.

- Sabonis becomes the leading rebounder in Franchise history passing Otis Thorpe with 840 rebounds in a season.

- Sabonis is also now the leader of 20-20 double doubles surpassing Giannis with 4. 

This has been an absolute Cinderella season for the Kings.",luck_panda,66,917,0.96
334,Sabonis is 3 games this week: 20.3 PTS 18.3 REB 10 AST,11te8uf,"Domantas having a phenomenal week, clearly should be locked for 3rd Team All NBA by now and probably second consecutive Player of The Week award is coming his way if the Kings finish the week strong with a win against Washington.

335,Would the 2018 Rockets offense still be as effective today?,11te6gk,"As most of us would know, the Houston Rockets were a dominant force in 2018 that were plagued by unfortunate injuries, and their simple yet effective offense of running isolations and pick and rolls for Harden and CP3 in a pure 5-out system played a huge part in their basketball dominance. 

However, I'm curious as to whether or not it would work today? Most teams in the league have incorporated heavy off-ball movement and screening into their offensive systems. While the 2018 Rockets were not bereft of any off-ball movement whatsoever, their 5-out system was enough to give Harden and CP3 the space they needed to operate in. 

Would this offensive system work today? If so, is it not being employed by more teams because of a lack of personnel?",Izrezar,42,14,0.73
336,Will Domantas Sabonis make an All-NBA team this year?,11te60a,"I've always felt that Sabonis has been a bit underrated for a while. But with the Kings playing so well, and with the numbers Sabonis is posting up, I think he has a great shot of making all-NBA. 

Embiid and Jokic have the first and second team Center spots locked up (In no particular order), so that just leaves one spot open for the third team. Sabonis' biggest competition for this spot would be Bam Adebayo, and while Bam is a better defender, All-NBA focuses more on offense, where Sabonis is superior. 

He's posting up 19/12/7, and is essentially a triple double threat as a Center/Forward hybrid. Moreover, he has been hyper efficient this season, shooting over 60% of the field with an impressive 67% TS. 

So with all of this being said, do you think Sabonis makes All-NBA this year? And as a bonus question, do you think he's a top 3 center in the NBA, surpassing KAT?",Varolyn,104,187,0.96
337,"Domantas Sabonis tonight in a win over the Brooklyn Nets: 24 points, 21 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 blocks",11te2m4,"The Sacramento Kings are 10-2 in their last 12 games. De'Aaron Fox has deservedly been getting most of the attention during this stretch, but Sabonis has been incredible recently as well.",ZeroShins,99,2011,0.99

344,"If Denver continues to struggle defensively and Kings lose their 3&D man Kevin Heurter, doesn't that make 7-10 seed more desirable?",11td3w4,"Denver recently struggled from defense and lost to tanking/play in teams 4 games straight. Their bench has been horrific and trades that they made(Bones, Thomas Bryant) were meaningless. Even though Jokic scores 35 points in 80% shooting, team somehow manages to lost based on their horrible defense from MPJ and Murray and turnovers. If their 3 point shooting goes cold in the playoffs, they have no way but put jokic for 45 minutes in a game

Kings are a legitimate contender I must admit, but losing Kevin can be huge. He has been their reliable 3 point shooter and losing him can be huge on offensive end. Also, I am not sure if they can keep up their hot streak from 3 point line and Fox actually performing in the playoffs.

Thats the 1st and 2nd seed in the west. For 3rd to 6th seed, except for the grizzlies who are mentally out of the control, all of them are legitimate title contenders like clippers, suns(not w/o KD), warriors.

Maybe for the west, getting play in spot might better than facing 3rd to 6th seed in the first round",junahn,44,0,0.2

You also have Alex Poythress, Archie Goodwin, Willie Cauley-Stein, and Nerlens Noel that could round out the 15 man roster. 

Now I know it's not just as easy as adding up their win shares, but if you do so, that team ends up with around 23 wins.  While certainly not great, that's still more wins than the Bobcats or Magic ended up with that season. Plus if you look at those same players win shares for the following season (not even including any players they would have picked up in the draft), they are probably a playoff team.

386,"Teams without their stars: Bucks, 76er, Warriors perform; Nuggets, Mavericks flail",11sy61v,"I was curious how teams perform with and without their star players.

|Team / Player|Win % with Star|Win % Without Star|Star Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bucks / Giannis|.759 (41-13)|.600 (9-6)|\+.159|
|Celtics / Tatum|.708 (46-19)|.400 (2-3)|\+.308|

|Warriors / Curry|.500 (22-22)|.538 (14-12)|\-.038|

Some things jumped out at me:

* It's remarkable how many games star players miss in this era. Kudos to Tatum.
* Denver and Mavs need to figure out their teams around Jokic and Doncic. Those are the stars with the most assists per game, so they may be more important to their teammates as playmakers.
* Warriors have been better without Curry than I expected. Similarly, I think of Celtics as a rounded team, but the small sample without Tatum has been surprisingly unsuccessful.

We don’t really get to see the 2016 version of Steph again until the 2019 playoffs and in subsequent seasons.

Since 2016 his stats by season without KD have been: 

2016: 30ppg, 5rpg, 7apg on 67%TS and 11 3PTA per game

2021: 32ppg, 5rpg, 6apg on 66%TS and 13 3PTA per game

2016-2023 is 8 Seasons and he’s put up similar production in all the seasons without KD except last season, in which he dominated on the way to a ring anyway.

So my question is, do you think it would’ve been possible to see this version of Steph for all those seasons if KD never joined? If so, do you think Steph would’ve gotten more respect from the public and media versus what he gets now?

*Durant had a higher average finish, but just barely at 3.6666

**Nobody led the league in 2 of the 3 categories,  Curry's finish was the highest average

**'James led the league in all 3 categories

A few things stand out to me from this data:

1. If you lead the league in 2 of the 3 categories, you win MVP
2. If no one leads the league in 2 of the 3, highest average wins

There are only 4 teams league-wide that have a winning record against teams above .500 :

Nuggets 20-11

Bucks 24-10

Next guards up: De'Aaron Fox, Trae Young

Next forwards up: Paul George, Lauri Markkanen

Next centers up: Kristaps Porzingis, Bam Adebayo (neither are particularly close)

Need to play more games to qualify (70% of max. games or minutes): Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant

TBD (Changed teams at the deadline, which messed with W/L %): Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant

# How did the models fare for the 2023 All-Star game?

In case you were wondering how the models did for the All-Star game, I had run the models on February 4. Of the 31 players with at least a 0.5 probability, 3 did not play enough games (AD, Harden, Booker) and predictably missed, 3 were predicted to make it but did not (Jimmy Butler, Trae Young, Darius Garland), and the other 25 made it. With 27 total All-Star selections, the unlikely All-Stars were Jrue Holiday and Jaren Jackson Jr.

# Notes

1. This is a model to predict likelihood (either they make it or they don't), and the order was constructed based on their likelihood. Therefore, ordering the players like so may be a fundamentally flawed concept, but it's still interesting to see what results come out.

2. By ""simple"" and ""widely available,"" the statistics used are pace-adjusted PPG, RPG, APG, Steals + Blocks per game (SBPG), relative true shooting (rTS), WS/48, and team W/L %. I know WS/48 is oft-maligned for various reasons and there may be some autocorrelation happening as a result, but it seems to provide some extra dimension of information and avoids the use of WS, BPM, VORP, etc.

3. I was the one making the teams work positionally, so if you have any complaints about the positional placements of players, blame me, not the machine.

4. Embiid, Jokic, and Giannis were a strong top 3 with little separation. It's worth noting that this is not a model made to predict the MVP so I wasn't trying to differentiate between them. Embiid and Jokic are effectively interchangeable for the purposes of making the teams.

5. Jaren Jackson Jr. has a probability of 0.289, and it was around here (0.287) for All-Star voting as well. Seems like the model doesn't have enough info to evaluate his 4.1 stocks per game, or possibly, high steals/blocks counts have more frequently belonged to big men who otherwise weren't good enough to make the All-Star/All-NBA game (see: early Gobert, Whiteside, Drummond, Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, etc.).

6. In descending order of probability (0.75+): Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, James Harden, Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Donovan Mitchell, Stephen Curry, Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler, De'Aaron Fox, Domantas Sabonis, Julius Randle, Pascal Siakam

7. After them (0.60-0.72): Trae Young, Darius Garland, Paul George, Jrue Holiday, Lauri Markkanen, Jalen Brunson, Anthony Edwards, DeMar DeRozan, Kristaps Porzingis, Tyrese Haliburton, Bam Adebayo.

8. The model predicts **either** All-Star **or** All-NBA appearances, so the 60% or higher being 7 out of 11 (63.6%) All-Stars seems to line up. None of them figure to be solidly in the All-NBA conversation.

9. Fox has been one of the strongest climbers over the last month, so with Ja missing games due to suspension, Fox may pass him and/or Dame. There is still a significant gap to be crossed though, so he's more likely to make it if Ja misses so many games it dents his resume.

408,Did the big 3 Miami Heat underachieve and are they overrated?,11so04z,"Over the past few weeks I’ve seen people constantly say they underachieved, To me no they didn’t. Some people think they should’ve went 4/4 some think 3/4 but it’s hard to win 1 ring let alone back 2 back. Obviously they should’ve won in 2011 but we know how that went but 4 finals in 4 years with 2 rings, 27 game winning streak(3rd all time) and a 66-16 win record(franchise record). That’s not underachieving(unless you genuinely thought they were gonna win 8 rings😂😂😂)

Are they overrated?
It seems they get overrated simply bc of lebron and the he only wins with stacked teams thing. Once 2013 hit you can tell both Dwade and bosh were starting to regress due to injury and dwades knees having constant fluid in them. The team was good don’t get me wrong but outside the big 3 the team was mid asf. The 4th best player was Mario chalmers in 2012. In 2013 the 4th option was 37 year old ray Allen(maybe Mario again). 2014 same thing. In the playoffs it was contagiously lebron only performing in the last 2 years. I feel like I’m gonna get flack for this but Dwade and bosh were horrendous in each pacers series and even with lebron masterclass performances the team would still lose cause Dwade is shooting 3-16 or bosh is shooting 1-8 yes injuries but it just seems weird how they would be hot garbage come the ecf/finals in 2013/2014
In game 6 of the 2012 ecf where lebron had the greatest game of his career. Dwade shot 6-17 
bosh shot 3-8

A combination of Jokic having a couple of bad defensive games, and Jamal Murray doing his best Russell Westbrook impersonation the Nuggets haven't managed a win in the last week.

Murray is averaging 16.3 points(on 18.3 attempts per game) and 5.5 assists on an abysmal 41.5%(almost 20% below league average) true shooting over this stretch.  Will Murray be able to turn it around to help Jokic fight off the Sixers and Bucks fans onslaught?

The locks on All-NBA guards are Luka, Dame, Mitchell, and Harden. Then, for the last two spots, you have SGA (incredible, but bad team), Haliburton (slightly less incredible, bad team), Brunson (great, but is he really better than these guys??), Booker (is the best SG in the league but missed a bunch of time), Kyrie (…), and Fox — who has comparable stats, while also being the most clutch player in the NBA on one of the best teams in the league. Like, winning counts to me, and I can’t say that anyone else in that tier has contributed to more winning.

Let me know if I’ve forgotten about a contender here, but to me it feels like SGA and Fox are the third team guards right now. Do people agree? Does anyone else think this hard about All-NBA third team guards??",bta47,62,55,0.8

426,"For the first time this season, Joel Embiid is the odds-on betting favorite to win MVP",11sjkr7,"https://www.rotowire.com/betting/nba/mvp-odds.php

Although plenty of Redditors, members of the media, and fans have argued about Embiid/Jokic/Giannis and the MVP award for three years now, betting markets have been incredibly reluctant to pick Joel Embiid as the favorite to win MVP. Jokic survived losing to the Sixers earlier in the season to become the heavy favorite for months, and even survived recent losses amidst unparalleled success from Embiid. Until tonight. For the first time all season (and probably since midway through last season) Joel Embiid is the betting favorite to win MVP.

Embiid: +115
Jokic: +130 (he’s not far behind)
Giannis: +350

No one else is close.

And based on the way, those are officiated — We got some guys that basically play like running backs in this league that get that call all the time — I was pretty confident.""",11siy47,"Lmfao I love this. He's also right, if he's watching film of how Giannis is officiated it's not a crazy assumption to assume that's a legal move for him to pull off. Also you can tell he's definitely on social media daily from the the running back reference.

Sub apparently doesn't allow image post but fox scored an additional 9poonts afterwards so he would be 42 ahead of Jimmy if the bulls broadcast is to be believed while hitting the game winner.

442,Postseason Reformatting,11shlvb,"For some reason, it bothers me how the NBA playoffs are divided geographically. Look at the NFL and MLB and you could have a New York-Boston Final, or an all Los Angeles Final, if they are good enough to make it. That’s probably because those 2 leagues were themselves merged from other leagues and the championship is AFC (former AFL) and NFC (older NFL); the World Series used to literally be 2 leagues fighting it out. 

For the NBA (and NHL, as the scheduling is similar), the regular season formula is fine: travel is hard, and you should play more games against your division to limit it.

However, for the playoffs, they should seed teams 1-16, irregardless of conference, and have a 4-round bracket that leads to the Finals. Maybe the 2 best teams are in the same conference and they should meet in the last round, not in earlier rounds simply because they are East or West.

Idk. It’s probably never going to happen but it just bothers me",Local_Stay4957,7,0,0.38

The Lakers absolutely HAD to win tonight, there was simply no other option if they truly wanted to make a run to the playoffs. Whether you want to blame the incompetent medical staff for such a ridiculous decision, or Jeanie for refusing to sign a 10 day big man for money reasons despite having no available centers (they knew this weeks in advance), one thing is certain and that is that the Lakers front office is still arguably the worst in the league.

[https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/\_/gameId/401469190](https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401469190)

Overall an outstanding night on both ends for Joel Embiid despite his turnovers and the looming possibility of him fouling out in the 4th. Embiid finished with 36 points on 12-19 shooting, including two threes and 10-10 FT. He also grabbed 18 rebounds, had three assists, and an outstanding 4 blocks.

With this win, the Sixers improve their win streak to six and their record to 46-22, placing them either right ahead of or behind the Celtics depending on the result of their game.",Professor_Finn,524,3633,0.9

459,The Most Consistently Productive Stat Sheet Stuffers (Game Score),11sdmb1,"Game score is a player evaluation metric which can be considered John Hollinger's simple and linear version of the Player Efficiency Rating. Game Score does not make any adjustments like PER does for team pace.

An ""average"" Game Score is considered 10, while 40 is considered a fantastic Game Score.

Listed here are the 42 most consistent players at producing a game Score at 10 or higher. 42 players was used because of the cutoff at 80% of games doing so.

How to read:

Player: X/Y (percentage)

X = the number of games that the player has produced a Game Score of at least 10. Y = the total number of games the player has played. I have done some manual work and subtracted games where players did not produce a high Game Score and played under 20 minutes, because this is an accumulation statistic (all-in-one box score) and in games where players were injured it did not feel fair to penalize their percentage. However we are counting games under 20 minutes where they produced a Game Score of at least 10 because that means they were efficient in a short time and it feels like this should be rewarded for this list.

The list is ordered by players who most frequently posted a Game Score of 10 or higher relative to the number of games they played.

465,Bucks without Giannis: 9-6. 76ers without Embiid: 9-4,11sc11m,"It is worth noting 11-6 for Giannis may be more appropriate since he left 2 games early.

76ers are also 5-2 with Harden but no Embiid. They've beat much better teams as well. They beat the Kings without Harden and Embiid and beat the Nets with both Kyrie and Harden.

The only .500+ quality team the Bucks have beat without Giannis is the Heat when he left early. They technically beat two other teams above .500 (Suns and Nets). However, the Nets played their entire bench that game and the Suns have a losing record post KD trade in games he doesn't play (which that was one of them).

Bucks win percentage without Giannis is 65% (using 11-6). With him it is 76%.

76ers are at 69% without Embiid. They are at 67% with him.

Point is: The entire narrative that Giannis somehow has so much more help and that his team is still so good without him just seems wrong. Don't get me wrong, the Bucks supporting cast is great and they complement Giannis extremely well but without him they aren't as equipped to win as the 76ers. Harden can run the offense much better than anyone on the Bucks and the 76ers have much better options in terms of guys that can create shots for themselves and others. If Middleton was his normal 33 MPG 20+ PPG self it might be a different discussion but for this season it seems very clear the 76ers have been clearly better without their star than the Bucks. Which is not what the narrative is.

Both teams can certainly lose in the first round but let's say they both survive. They're 2-2 on the year, though the two Sacramento wins came without Bane in one and without Ja in the other.

First, some basic assumptions - let's say that Ja is available for all games, that Adams is questionable and probably not 100% if he does play, and Clarke is obviously out for the season. On the Kings side, everyone is available. Grizzlies are the current 2 seed so let's say they have home court advantage.

I think this is a fascinating offense vs. defense series, where the Grizzlies are clearly the tougher team with a much better defense thanks to JJJ, but struggle to make shots consistently, especially at the end of games.

476,Who are your Top 10 Players in the league right now not based solely off this season.,11s8rxf,"Obviously there are going to be players that are performing inform this season compared to other great players who might be injured or not doing anything.

 1. Giannis

Undeniably the most dominant player on both ends. Champion. 50 point close out.

2. Steph Curry

Greatest shooter, still in a sort of prime coming fresh off a FMVP. 

3. Kevin Durant

Again, Proven top 3 talent for decades and he looks even better now and might secure a FMVP this post-season

4. Embiid

Embiid is the most skilled bigman we've ever seen, he got a kobe/mj esque midrange and is a 3 level threat while being a good playmaker and facilitator while being a DPOY level player. Has yet to prove himself as HIM in the playoffs like the 3 above him

5.Luka

Controversial but what he has done in the post-season negates his defence and regular-season records. he's obviously a top 5 talent in the league and i think he just edges out the 6th best in the league which is obviously

6.Jokic

Regular season monster, Efficient everywhere albeit at a small clip probably the greatest passing big man we've seen and one of the greatest playmakers we've seen. I think he's great and i know people are gonna be like wow hes so low for being a mvp front-runner but like Embiid he just hasn't been HIM in the postseason and he just isn't as dominant offensively and defensively to make up for it.

7.:LBJ

Should be higher but his failure as a laker for the past 3 seasons and the fact the he does look a step slower than the top KD and Steph makes me think that Prme LBJ would definitely carry these Lakers teams to atleast the 2nd Round and he hasn't. Statistically he's been great and its amazing that he's still even top 10 at this point in his carrer

8.Harden

Harden in my opinion is the best playmaker currently in the league he's having his best 3pt season he is still carving up defences and has proven himself time after time as a capable defender

9. Kawhi

he doesn't play would easily be top 3 but he doesn't play. 

10. Anthony Davis

Similary to Kawhi this dude just doesn't player, hasn't been able to do anything with LBJ since the bubble and he's never availble, a return to form seems imminent  and he might shoot up to top 5 after this season",xiumn,69,0,0.43
477,Did Shaq single handedly tank the Lakers chance of 4-peating in 2003?,11s81xx,"As much flack that Shaq gets about being lazy/out of shape, the ""I got hurt on company time, I'll heal on company time"" thing doesn't get brought up too often today as one of the biggest diva moves that hurt a team. Don't get me wrong this was talked about all the time when it happened and Shaq was rightfully criticized but you would think haters of his would bring this up all the time

So basically what had happened was that in the 2002 offseason Shaq needed surgery for an arthritic toe, but decided not to do it and wait right before training camp because he didn't want to mess his summer up. This directly led to the Lakers going 11-19 in the first 30 games, which meant LA had to play 100% in long stretches to finish 5th in the conference. The problem with that was when they got to the playoffs the players were totally exhausted, especially by the time they faced San Antonio in the West. And I'm not taking anything away from the 03 Spurs, definitely an overlooked team that doesn't get talked about as one of the best defensive lineups ever. However as a result of the grueling work load from the regular season and playing 14 playoff series in a row, Kobe was playing through injuries, Rick Fox was out, Horry missed every single 3 he took in the conference semi finals and went 2/20 the previous round, and even Shaq got outplayed by Duncan. Maybe it's just all speculation that Shaq's actions led to all of this but I gotta imagine that they beat the Spurs and go on to win the title if Shaq gets the treatment, the series went to 6 with all that happening

I understand that Shaq 3 peated and maybe deserved to relax, ""only three-peating"" is pretty dumb to complain about. And I also don't buy the idea that Shaq's laziness/fitness robbed him of his potential because he got fit again in Miami/Phoenix while still being a top 5 center until he turned 38, it was his free throws.  Shaq with a Kobe work ethic IMO isn't viable considering he was 7'1 and over 300 pounds even when fit, he dealt with foot injuries all the time. But in the end this is a totally selfish move that killed their chance at a championship and the first modern 4-peat right? Everyone on the team suffered because Shaq just wanted a longer vacation",lowercase-punishment,41,26,0.65

His presence is significant enough to leave a vacancy in the vibe.

He isn’t a magnet in the space like Stephen Curry, whose cubicle is teeming with boxes of shoes and swag. Wiggins doesn’t set the tone like Draymond Green and his booming voice, or lighten the mood like Andre Iguodala’s random discussions. But it’s noticeable Wiggins is not there laughing with Jordan Poole or talking across the room’s diameter to JaMychal Green. Wiggins’ smile is usually a symbol that things are well.

486,NBA's full statement on the Ja Morant suspension,11s6qrr,"> NEW YORK, March 15, 2023 - The NBA announced today that Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant has been suspended eight games without pay for conduct detrimental to the league. The discipline is in response to Morant's live streaming of a video on March 4 in which he is holding a firearm in an intoxicated state while visiting a Denver area nightclub. Morant will be eligible to return for the team's game against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday, March 20.

> A meeting took place today in the NBA's New York offices between NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and Morant to discuss Morant's conduct. NBA Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars and NBPA Executive Director Tamika Tremaglio, among others, attended the meeting.

> The league office conducted an investigation of the March 4 incident. Based on the information obtained during the investigation, the league did not conclude that the gun at issue belonged to Morant, was brought by him into the nightclub or was displayed by him beyond a brief period.
The investigation also did not find that Morant possessed the gun while traveling with the team or in any NBA facility, and the Colorado authorities did not find sufficient cause to charge Morant with a crime.

> ""Ja's conduct was irresponsible, reckless and potentially very dangerous,"" said Silver. ""It also has serious consequences given his enormous following and influence, particularly among young fans who look up to him. He has expressed sincere contrition and remorse for his behavior. Ja has also made it clear to me that he has learned from this incident and that he understands his obligations and responsibility to the Memphis Grizzlies and the broader NBA community extend well beyond his play on the court.""

487,"Between March 25th and April 2nd, the MVP candidates will all face each other. Will this one week decide the MVP race?",11s6ofa,"Giannis will face Jokic on the 25th and Embiid on the 2nd. Giannis has not yet faced Jokic this season, and has a record of 1-2 versus Embiid. Against the 76ers he has averaged 27/13/5/1/2 with 4 turnovers on 53%TS. 

Jokic will face Giannis on the 25th and Embiid on the 27th. Jokic has not yet faced Giannis this season, and has a record of 0-1 versus Embiid. In one game against the 76ers he put up a line of 24/8/9/0/2 with 7 turnovers on 82%TS. 

Embiid will face Jokic on the 27th and Giannis on the 2nd. Embiid has faced both this season and has a record of 3-1 against them. In these games he has averaged 31/12/7/1/2 with 4 turnovers on 55%TS.

This one week could totally decide the MVP race. With the way the media is starting to shift, I'm not sure Jokic's case can withstand getting burned by Embiid again(47/18/5/3/2 on 66%TS) let alone Giannis' potentially punishing him at the rim. Similarly, it may be hard for voters to justify Giannis if he ends this stretch with a 1-4 record agains the other candidates. I would argue the pressure might be greatest on Embiid though. Having never won an MVP, all eyes will be on him as the media shifts in his favor. The opportunity to dominate in games versus these two and build a 5-1 season record against them is too good to pass up.

490,Who is the favorite to come out of the West?,11s64v9,"Who are the favorites out of the wild west assuming all players come back and teams get healthy? I almost feel like the top 3 teams in the league are in the East, then next majority are all from the west.  

I understand the regular season standings is one list, but in reality who are the teams most feared?

**1a tier**

If Wiggins is back I have to say the **Warriors** are the 1a team that's a hair above the rest.

If Kd is back the **Suns** should be the number 1 team on paper, but with limited time playing together it will be hard for them to get their chemistry down while in the middle of the big fight that is the playoffs.

The **Lakers** are the most interesting to me because obviously Lebron. This team got so much better this year, with trades, and AD can take over a game defensively and down low. It will be hard to call anyone a favorite against this LA team with a healthy Lebron, from the way they have been playing since ASB.

**1b tier**

I want to put my Kings here but for the same reasons you could put the **Nuggets** here, their offense. And the Nuggets have playoff experience over the Kings. Plus the better record helps break the tie.

**Grizzlies** are a tough team to play, in any situation on any given day. They are not a team anyone wants to get down and dirty with in the playoffs an if/when Ja comes back, they will be even tougher.

My **Kings** can surprise any team in the league. We are finally getting the respect we deserve and its been a long time coming. We have the number one offense and more importantly, we have a closer. We all know that in the playoffs, you need a ""Kobe"" type of player who can iso their way to a bucket in any scenario.

**1c tier**

Clippers/Mavs I dont know what to say about them. I haven't watched enough **Clippers** to tell what kind of Kawhi/PG13 dup there will be. I want to put the clippers a lot higher but maybe someone can chime in on them for me. Kawhi has Finals experience and is a great two way player to count out.

The **Mavs** have two of the best offensive ball handlers in the league, definitely the best guard duo in the game. But what's beyond that? Do we need 40 point Kyrie and Luka every game in the playoffs? Again the star power here makes me at first want to rank them higher, but a team with 2 elite guards and nothing else has never been successful in the playoffs. You need bigs and defense when the game slows down.




**Edit:** It's true, I would fear the Lakers over the Nuggets, Grizzlies, and Kings. I changed my original post, Lakers from 6 to 3.",-Hoopin-,45,0,0.47

For those who aren’t sure how the stat works, defensive rating is how much your team gives up on the other end while you are on the floor, per 100 possessions. A higher defensive rating is worse.

Defensive rating isn’t necessarily a good individual stat. However, in my opinion, centers have a larger impact on the defensive rating than any other positions. If you have a good defensive center, most likely you’ll have a solid to good defense. If you have a bad defensive center, most likely you’ll have a bad defense.

522,Brook Lopez for All-NBA,11ryy0z,"While Embiid and Jokic will certainly take the first two All-NBA spots for Cs, I think it's about time Brook Lopez makes it and he deserves his place on the All-NBA 3rd Team.

While Jrue may have made the all-star team, Brook is imo the second most important player on the Bucks, and while not nearly on Giannis' MVP caliber level his unique contributions make him almost equally as defining for the Bucks' entire identity.

In one of the strangest career turns in NBA history, when talking about Lopez you have to start with the defensive end of the floor. The current front runner for DPOY, he is by far the key to the Bucks' defense. **While Jrue and Giannis are fantastic on that end, with those two healthy and Lopez injured they were just the 14th ranked defense last season. Now with Brook back they're in contention to be 1st on that end** despite Giannis and Jrue combining for nearly 30 missed games already. Guess who has only missed 1 game this year? Brook Lopez. We've seen what it looks like with him and without him - **he is the centerpiece on this end**, and might be the best defender at the league's most important defensive position.

Offensively his contributions have been nothing short of stellar as well. His raw numbers are solid, but they really don't come close to telling the whole story. While Giannis is the driving force of the Bucks' offense, **their entire scheme - the 5-out offense to give Giannis a ton of space - is based upon one thing: Lopez's ability to stretch the floor.** Giannis is the driving force, but without a C who can shoot it like Lopez can, there is no 5-out offense in the first place. He's also shown to be more than capable of ramping up his offensive volume when needed averaging over 21ppg over his last 12 games.

**Having played 68/69 games for the Bucks so far, being the centerpiece of their defense nearly singlehandedly vaulting them from average to elite on that end, and being the 5-out for a superstar that really needs to play in a 5-out offense, Brook Lopez is clearly the second most valuable player on the best team in the NBA.** He's been more valuable on both ends of the floor than Bam making his only competition Sabonis. Given the massive gap on defense(Sacramento is 26th on that end for reference), I think that's more than enough to make up for Sabonis' advantages as a passer.",RealPrinceJay,52,2,0.52

527,Underrated Prospects to watch in the NCAA Tournament,11ry839,"Like many fans, I watch the NCAA Tournament for two reasons -- to gamble, and to ""scout"" the next generation of NBA talent.

It's not a particularly strong crop of college players this year, and you may know the top names. However, for this post, we're going to look past the lottery picks and flag some players who may be undervalued based on their current ranking (on ESPN's draft page.)

---

**SF Dariq Whitehead, Duke, # 28 prospect on ESPN**

Dariq Whitehead is following a similar career arc to current rookie, A.J. Griffin. They were both top 10 recruits who enrolled at Duke to much fanfare. Both suffered injuries and struggled out of the gates, resulting in modest numbers as freshmen. For his part, Whitehead is averaging only 8.3 points per game.

But like A.J. Griffin, you can still see flashes of an NBA starter here. Griffin was a lights out shooter at Duke and Whitehead isn't far behind -- hitting 41.1% from 3 and 88.5% from the line. Whitehead is also a more fluid athlete than Griffin and uses his length and basketball IQ to be a good defender. From what I understand, he's also a high character guy.

There's a chance Whitehead can reverse his sagging momentum with a strong tournament and make his way back into the lottery. But if not, teams should look at him as a great value in mid R1. It's not easy to find potential wing starters -- and he has all the tools you'd want to get there one day.

---

**PF Trayce Jackson-Davis, Indiana, # 31 on ESPN**

Trayce Jackson-Davis is a candidate for the Wooden Award for best college player, and comes with NBA bloodlines (as Dale Davis' son). Yet, the league doesn't care much about him. Honestly, it's hard to blame them. He's old -- 23. Yuck. He doesn't shoot threes. Barf.

Still, Jackson-Davis happens to be good at ""basketball."" He averaged 20.8 points, 10.9 rebounds, and 2.7 blocks this season. That, coupled with his size (6'9"", 245) would make him a traditional PF back in his dad Dale's day. In today's game, it would make him a likely center/""big."" But that could be a positive. You'd almost prefer to have a 6'9"" big than a plodding 7-footer these days. Jackson-Davis can give you some athleticism and genuine skill at the position. He's comfortable with the ball in his hands -- illustrated by his 4.1 assists per game. He may end up being an NBA player in the mold of a Dwight Powell. That may not sound like any great shakes, but that's a value in R2.

---

**SF Keyontae Johnson, Kansas State, # 38 on ESPN**

Once again, ""age"" is one factor that's pushing down our next pick Keyontae Johnson. Johnson is 22 and suffered a scary injury back at Florida. Team doctors will have to check him carefully before signing off on him as a draft pick.

But if they *do*, this kid could be a real steal at his draft position. He's 6'6"", 230, and built like a grown ass [man](https://kansasstate.rivals.com/news/kso-nuggets-keyontae-johnson-arrives-in-manhattan?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGvyPu4GvCsaRrPzI4F69dfgAJSj8P31eTJ-k_iLAvUBqHQBCjv7BJZ1o39TJ9VEkgNoBOXJq_ygW5wvMq7Easihv5fzq7KTJvVFS02i2ImhGg6FGcUfuV_5gq84UOTM2q5KMRpyJ5uFQ4Wmyco5bJNSSyvAtldJzedqKFW4b4Vd). He has all-around skill, averaging 17.7 points, 7.0 rebounds, and hitting 41.9% from 3. My friend said it best when he remarked: ""Keyontae Johnson is who Jae Crowder *thinks* he is."" If he can have a better or even similar career, he'd be a great bargain on the second day.

---

**SG Terrence Shannon, Illinois, # 43 on ESPN**

We're sticking with the oldies with Terrence Shannon, a 22-year-old wing who has also been around college for 4+ years and played for multiple different schools.

Still, Shannon has the skill set that NBA teams want as a potential 3+D wing. The ""D"" is further along right now, as he uses his sturdy 6'6"" 210 size well to guard multiple positions. He's only shooting 32.7% from 3 this season, but he's shot better in the past and may get back into serviceable range. I'd comp him to someone like Josh Richardson -- again, not an exciting player, but one who's had a long NBA career.

---

**SG Amari Bailey, UCLA, # 73 on ESPN**

We're flipping down to the freshman here with Amari Bailey, a top 20 recruit who hasn't done a ton at UCLA so far. He's only averaging 10.6 points and 2.0 assists per game. Offensively, it's hard to see him thriving. He's not a great shooter (35% from 3, 68% from the line) and not a dynamic point guard. 

Still, there's a role for an Amari Bailey type at the next level. He's a big, athletic guard who can potentially hound opposing PGs and play off the ball on offense -- similar to the role that Alex Caruso or prime Avery Bradley serve. Given his age, Bailey would also have more upside from there if a team can develop his skill set. UCLA had an injury to veteran Jaylin Clark, so Bailey will have an extended opportunity to improve his stock this month.",ZandrickEllison,6,46,0.9

Jokic is averaging 24.7 PTS 10 AST

Embiid is averaging 33.4 PTS 4.1 AST

I see a lot of people basically disregard the 8.7 point difference between the two because Jokic has 5.9 more assists and therefore the offensive output is the same if not higher for Jokic

Now let’s compare two different players 

SGA is averaging 31.3 PTS and 5.6 AST

Harden is averaging 21.8 PTS and 10.8 AST

Here the point difference is 9.5 and the assist difference is 5.2.

The overall narrative is the SGA is having an all time season and is a top 5 MVP candidate, 1st team NBA.

Harden on the other hand didn’t make the all-star game. 

I think points have always been more important as an overall stat and should be held more valuable as an offensive comparison. In addition efficiency is  amazing for both Jokic (70TS) and Embiid (64TS).

Despite the current losing streak and not having a better record than Giannis or Embiid, the voters will likely use the ‘#1 seed in the West’ argument to hand Jokic the MVP.

549,The Bucks are four games ahead of the 76ers/Nuggets. At which gap does team record make Giannis the undeniable MVP?,11rnxy9,"The thumb-of-rule for the award was historically ""best player on the best team"". Outside of outliers such as 2017 Westbrook and 2022 Jokic, for the past 15 years the award went to a top 3 seed. As we approach the end of the 2023 season, the three most popular candidates belong to two 1 seeds and a 3 seed

However, the Bucks have set themselves apart from the Nuggets and the 76ers by a four-game gap. At what point do we acknowledge that superior team performance is too overwhelming to ignore and thus overrides all other statistical criteria, giving Giannis the MVP by default? Five games? Seven games? *Ten* games?

It's arbitrary, to be sure. Personally at five games, it's already a big point in Giannis' favor that would put him in the lead. At seven or more, it's a no-brainer",FlochofBirds,106,0,0.46

The Mavs are 0-6 without THJ this year. We're playing the tanking Spurs, sure, but we aren't winning against them without our top four scorers.

What's going on in Dallas? Are the Mavs stealth tanking? They're 3-9 in their last 12 games. They've fallen from 4th to 9th in the West and are just a half game ahead of 11th. There doesn't seem to be any sense of urgency among the team (see Jason Kidd's recent statements) about their growing likelihood of missing the playoffs.

552,Is Giannis getting the LeBron treatment? AKA playing like an MVP player but not getting the recognition anymore.,11rmuvh,"After 2013, despite playing as an MVP every year since 2018, he never got another award. He was still in the talks but realistically he was never going to win it.

It's a tale as old as time with Booker and Jrue. Even at Booker's most energetic tonight Jrue was just blocking and stripping him at every other possession. But like Giannis in the 4th, the gas from a back to back absolutely caught up to him and threw off his play.

But this does not detract from the fact Jrue's defense was so good, him going 4-14 and 5 turnovers couldn't stop him from having a plus minus of +20. Just masterclass defense",0dias_Chrysalis,20,63,0.72
554,Are the Mavs in trouble?,11rmd08,"They are one of the worst teams since the All Star break. A lot of that is due to Irving and Luka being injured. You also have Kidd saying dumb stuff to reporters. There is a high possibility they don't even make the playoffs. They have the Lakers, Grizzlies, and Warriors coming up. They also have the Spurs and Hornets which recently beat the Nuggets and Celtics so those are major trap games. Then the bigger picture is if they even keep Irvin. No one knows what Irving will think the next day. If they don't keep him how does that affect Luka. Is he going to go around demanding a trade like a lot of stars?

Their defense is fucking nasty man. It's not even a Big 3 at this point, it's a Big 4. And Giannis/Jrue/Brook feel like a borderline historical defensive starting 3-man trio. 




This team, while being not only the best defense in the NBA, is 5th in 3pt% in this timeframe. The Bucks really put a titan defense around Giannis AND gave him shooters. Hard to see anyone beating this team come playoff time.",MWiatrak2077,108,688,0.95

------------------------------------------

Just think of all the legendary nicknames from players of that era.

Kobe - Black Mamba

Tim Duncan - The Big Fundamental

Shaq - he has a bunch so take your pick

AI - The Answer

Paul Pierce - The Truth

KG - The Big Ticket

Ray Allen - Jesus Shuttlesworth

Andrei Kirilenko - AK47

Amar'e - STAT

Shawn Marion - The Matrix

Corey Magette - Bad Porn

Yao Ming - the Great Wall

Vince Carter - Vinsanity, Half Man Half Amazing

Jason Williams - White Chocolate

Robert Horry - Big Shot Bob

Brian Scalabrine - White Mamba

Matt Bonner - Red Rocket

Richard Hamilton - Rip

Jamal Crawford - J Crossover

Josh Smith - J Smoove

Dwight Howard - Superman

Dwyane Wade - Flash

Chris Paul - The Point God

Lebron James - King James

Darko Milicic - The Human Victory Cigar

Steve Francis - the Franchise

Gilbert Arena - Agent 0

Rafer Alston - Skip 2 My Lou

And Im sure I forgot a few more

------------------------------------------

How many players in the league today have nicknames on that level?

Aside from Lebron and CP3, the only ones I can think of are 

Kawhi - The Klaw

KD - Slim Reaper

Embiid - The Process

Harden - the Beard

Dillion Brooks - Evil Danny Green

Steph Curry - Skyfucker

Giannis - the Greek Freak

Lopez - Splash Mountain

Lauri - The Finnisher

Robert Williams - Timelord

572,Jeremy Sochan vs Paolo Banchero,11rjld5,"Shout out to both these talented young front court rookies tonight. 

Particularly to sochan who probably isn't as well known to the general public as the soon to be (deserved) rookie of the year

Paolo: 27 points 11-21 6 rebounds 0 assists 2 blocks 0 steals  in 32 minutes 

Sochan: 29 points 11-19 11 rebounds 2 assists 0 blocks 1 steal  in 32 minutes

On top of the great individual stellar play Paulo as he often has been all year initiated so much offense for Orlando, and even commanded double teams at times. He's such a skilled finisher so early in his career in that pull-up mid-range jumper is money

Jeremy ran point guard for large stretches for San Antonio as he has for much of the year and for the most part looked really sharp. He also defended everyone from coe Anthony, to Wendell Carter, to fultz, to Paolo himself. He was really the only player that seems to have any effect on Paolo who ate San Antonio alive in the first quarter.

This wasn't even a sensational game from Paolo's standard which is scary

And Jeremy is probably not only the most improved rookie from the start of the year till now, but maybe the most improved player, in season, in the league. 

Both of these guys are going to be monsters in my opinion.",paxusromanus811,22,89,0.88

578,James Harden is ranked 4th on the MVP Award tracker for Basketball Reference.,11rjdg5,"Despite not making the 2023 all star team this year James Harden currently has the 4th best odds for MVP.

He’s averaging 21.8 points on 62.3% true shooting, which is one of his most efficient seasons ever, along with almost 40% from 3 (39.8%). On top of all this he’s leading the league in assists with 10.8 assists and currently has the 76ers at the 3rd seed with the 76ers being 33-11 since his return from injury.

I feel like a lot of this impact is going unnoticed due to the MVP debate between Embiid, Jokic and Giannis. A lot of the fans want to give a ton of credit to Embiid for what the 76ers are doing right now, as they should since he’s the best player on the team but Harden is starting to become very underrated.

7 - **31/37** Blazers

8 - **31/36** Bulls

9 - **32/36** Washington (10th in play-in)

10 - **33/36** Jazz/Raptors (tied; Raptors are in the play-in as the 9th seed)

613,"I traced the rise of the three point shot. It's mostly a slow and steady rise except from 2014-2020, when the league average rose from seven successful threes in 2014-15 to twelve in 2019-20. That was a crazy six years! And the Warriors led the way, with five Finals appearances and three rings.",11rczdm,"In 1979-80, the three point shot was introduced into the NBA. Interestingly, this was three years after the merger with the ABA. It took the NBA that long to accept an ABA innovation. But at first players very rarely tried it, with an average of less than one successful three point shot per game across the league.

Seven years later, in 1986-87, the league finally averaged more than one successful three point shot per game. This was one year after the NBA added the three point contest to All Star Weekend. The three point shot, led by the success of Larry Bird, was beginning to become a thing. But it was still rare.

A mere two years later, in 1988-89, the league averaged more than two successful three point shots per game. Coaches had begun to insert three point specialists in the corner for outlet passes. Usually they just stood there in the half court offense while the star did his thing and maybe passed them the ball. But as yet they were a minor irritant.

It took another four years, until 1992-93, for the league to average three successful three point shots per game. 

And then the league got impatient. In 1994 the three point line was shortened and suddenly the league jumped to over five successful threes per game. That lasted three years, but dropped back down to over four successful threes per game after the experiment ended in 1997. It's unclear when the league would have hit four per game absent the experiment. Sometime between three and six years after it hit three.

Not until 2001-02 did the league again hit five threes per game.

It took another six years, until 2006-07, before the league hit six threes per game.

It took another seven years, until 2012-13, before the league hit seven threes per game.

It took only three years, until 2015-16, for the league to hit eight threes per game.

Between 2014-15 and 2019-20, there was a rapid explosion of threes, never seen before except when the league shortened the line. The league went from over seven threes per game in 2014-15, to over eight in 2015-2016, to over nine in 2016-17, to over ten in 2017-18, to over eleven in 2018-19, and finally to over twelve in 2019-20. Wow!

Interestingly, despite the continued rise in offense the last three years, the number of successful threes has leveled off at somewhere between twelve and thirteen. The extra points are now coming inside the three point line. 

Have we reached a permanent three point plateau? I wouldn't even speculate about that until at least eight seasons have passed, since we had a seven year plateau at six successful three point shots before, only to shoot up to twice that number. 

Can you imagine teams successfully hitting eighteen threes per game? Or more? I find it hard to comprehend. And yet I can't rule it out.

620,"George Mikan had a fantastic three year peak, arguably the best ever.",11r7y00,"According to Win Shares, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had the best three year stats in NBA history in 1970-73. But he only won a championship in 1971. Wilt Chamberlain is next from 1961-64, but he didn't win any championships during that three year period. 

In third we have George Mikan from 1948-51, *and* he won two championships in those three years. And after Mikan we have Michael Jordan from 1987-1990, with no championships, or from 1988-1991, with slightly lower stats but one championship.

Statistically, according to Win Shares, no one else is even in the discussion. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan both threepeated multiple times, but their Win Shares during those threepeats were not comparable.

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ws\_season.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ws_season.html)

Because of Mikan's combination of stats and championships from 1948-51, one might argue that it's the best three year peak in NBA history. Of course it was a different time and the league was in its infancy. But when comparing players from different eras we usually compare how dominant they were at the time, and don't try to speculate about how dominant they would be today.

It's also worth noting that Mikan was so dominant that he prompted several significant rule changes in the NBA, including the introduction of the goaltending rule, the widening of the foul lane — known as the ""Mikan Rule"" — and the creation of the shot clock.

And, as a funny side note, Mikan was also indirectly responsible for the introduction of the three point line into the NBA. As the first commissioner of the ABA he adopted the three point line in that league, and it was added in the NBA after the merger with the ABA.

Anyway, when discussing the greatest peaks in NBA history, don't forget George Mikan. He should at least be in the conversation.",wjbc,84,68,0.8

**The reason is,** I just want to check if it's also a cultural thing or an attitude you get once you played in Europe first. I know it also has to do with injuries (could also check it as well).

I don't mind if you give me the data to do so (or a website where I can easily trace what I was looking for), or you'd do it yourself - it's just an idea that came into my head & I'm curious about it.

If you do it yourself, you can always credit me for the idea (though I've never checked if someone came up with this thing before me, it just popped out of nowhere inside my head).

634,How is AI a better scorer than Russell Westbrook?,11r0pwi,"I am going off both of their MVP seasons.

**True Shooting**

Westbrook: 31.6ppg on 55.4% true shooting, with a league average of 55.2%. For PGs exclusively, it was 54.4%. So he was 0.2% better than league average and exactly 1% better than his position average.

AI: 31.1ppg on 51.8% true shooting, with a league average of 51.8%. For SGs it was 52.7%. He had dead league average efficiency and slightly under 1% less efficient compared to his position.

So marginal difference between AI and Russ, neither were particularly efficient at their peak.

**Stats Per 36**

Westbrook: 32.9ppg

AI: 26.7ppg

Obviously, the fact that Iverson was so durable should be recognized within itself, but it should also be recognized how this would inflate his scoring averages. Westbrook accomplished roughly as much in 8 less minutes, with Westbrook averaging 34.6 minutes in 2017 and AI averaging 42 minutes in 2001, which is 21.3% more minutes per game.

If Westbrook was averaging 42 minutes per game he would have averaged 38.3ppg -- assuming his stamina didn't take a significant hit and he could continue scoring at the same production (which I recognize is unlikely). Or alternatively, if AI averaged 34.6 minutes per game, he would have a 25.6ppg average.

**Scoring Inflation**

Westbrook: 31.6ppg out of a league average team score of 105.6ppg. So he was good for 29.9% of the league average point total, and 29.6% of just the Thunder's (who averaged 106.6 that season).

AI: 31.1ppg out of a league average team score of 94.8, which is good for 32.8%. For just Philly, it was also 32.8% (who averaged only 0.1 point less than league average).

AI has a slight advantage here, but again you would have to consider AI's inflated minute average. In per 36, Russ would have averaged 36.2% of an average team box score if he played the same minutes as AI. Or alternatively, AI would have averaged 27% if he played the same minutes as Westbrook.

**Scoring Accolades**

Westbrook: 2 scoring titles. Context is needed here, Russ was the 1st (or only) scoring option in 2015 and 2017, when KD was injured and when KD left. After, he had Paul George and Harden both being the primary scorers (Harden won the scoring title in 2020 and PG was the runner-up in 2019). In every other season of his career in his prime, he had another capable or elite scorer on his squad.

AI: 4 scoring titles. And to be fair, he averaged 33ppg in 2005-06 behind a legendary scoring season by Kobe. But context is also needed here, he was the main scorer on all of his 76ers squads,  it is easier to retain high scoring numbers when your 2nd highest scorer is averaging 15 and under, opposed to sharing the load with people competing for the scoring title like KD, Paul George and Harden. When AI was put next to another elite scorer in Melo, his scoring numbers deflated similar to what you saw in Russ's 2010-11 NBA season (his 3rd year) when he was behind young KD, both averaging almost 23ppg per 36, on roughly the same league average game score, on similar efficiency numbers.

**EDIT:** Just for fun, I'll add 2015 Russ as well: 28.1ppg on 53.6% true shooting, 0.2% better than league average (53.4) and 1.1% better than his position (52.5). This is in 34.4 mpg, in a league where the average team score was 100. Meaning, Westbrook was responsible for 28.1% of the league average point total, and 27% for OKC specifically (who had 104 ppg). This is slightly better efficiency than peak scoring AI (05-06), and if AI's minutes were reduced to 34.4 like Russ's, he'd average 26.3ppg, or if Russ's minutes increased to 43.1, he'd average 33.7ppg.

05-06 AI was responsible for 34% of league average point total (97), or 33% of the Sixers (who averaged 2 more ppg than league average). If the minutes were adjusted to be more inline with 2015 Russ, he'd be responsible for 27% of the league average point total, and 26% of the Sixers score total, similar if not slightly worse than Russ. If you increased Russ's output to match Iverson's average mpg, he'd be responsible for 33.7% of the league average scoring total or 32.4% of OKC's.

17,Jalen Green tonight: 40 points on 11/22 shooting (4/9 from 3),11w4fwz,"Jalen had a big all around game with 27/6/7 in a comeback win against the Pels on Friday and followed it up tonight with a big scoring night mostly in the 2nd half to keep the Rockets in it. It's his 5th career 40 point game despite being a 21 year old sophomore and is a incredibly talented tough shot maker, just needs the rest of the team to make it easier on him so he can be more consistent

18,"The Other, Other Guy: The Third ""Star"" of NBA Championship Teams",11w48r4,"PRELUDE: My method of determining the third best player on teams is absolutely terrible, but I'm sticking through- I took the third best player of each championship team by win shares and ranked them all- first of all, I don't necessarily agree with every take from win shares, and some of them CERTAINLY don't match up with popular consensus. Anyway, on to the overly pretentious opening. 

Of course, a championship team is anchored by its super star- you think of the Jordan Bulls, Magic Lakers, Lebron whatever team he's on. Sometimes, there's even a duo involved, be it Duncan and Robinson, James and Davis, or Jordan and Pippen! Then you have the third guy. The mythical big three calls to mind images of super teams, but how does EVERY championship team's third guy shape out? Do you need a star to fill the role? To explore this question, I ranked all 73 ""third"" players by win shares! To go with the regular season stat (winshares), also throwing in a few rudimentary stats from their playoff run that year! Who contributes more to winning? Another premier scorer or that rock solid glue guy?

They scored just 4 points the entire rest of the way, and lost 126-118.",11vzwj2,"A Dejounte Murray pull-up jumper gave the Hawks a 114-108 lead with seven and a half minutes left in the game, a scoreline which then held for the next twenty seconds, before Romeo Langford was sent to the free throw line for San Antonio.

In the time that remained, the Hawks shot 2/15 from the field, scoring just 4 points, and giving up an 18-2 run which would see them lose 126-118.

Atlanta went 5 minutes and 42 seconds without scoring a single point (Dejounte Murray jump shot 7:30 4Q -> Clint Capela layup 1:48 4Q).

38,The Denver Nuggets might need to trade Jamal Murray,11vz652,"BEFORE YOU RESPOND, please just read the post first because the title is not what you might assume!!!


Nikola Jokic is making the Nuggets look a lot better than they really are, and if they want to have any shot at winning the championship, they need to get some more pieces around Jokic. 


However, looking at their salary situation, that is going to be a problem. Denver is currently $35 million over the salary cap, and they may very well have the worst contract in the NBA right now with Michael Porter Jr. Right now he’s in the first year of a 5 yr/$180mil deal that he’s on until the end of the 2027 season. I say this because while he’s an elite shooter, he provides little to no value in just about every other aspect of the game. He’s an adequate rebounder, maybe, but he’s a cone on defense and provides zero playmaking ability. He’s essentially a black hole on offense and a non factor on defense, and he’ll be making $180 million through 2027. I didn't even mention him being injury prone too. Not great.


Now if we take a look at their other pieces, the players that fit well with Jokic that Denver should absolutely not look to trade (if they can avoid it) are Aaron Gordon, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Bruce Brown. They all provide defensive value, can stretch the floor, and don’t need the ball in their hands to be effective. Outside of those 3 guys, the only tradeable pieces of some value that Denver has are Jeff Green, Ish Smith, Thomas Bryant, Zeke Nnaji… not really enough to get Jokic any legitimate help.


Now Denver obviously could package either 2 or 3 of the aforementioned players (Gordon, Brown, KCP) in order to find another star to pair with Jokic, but that would gut their defense and depth even further than it already is. And since the MPJ contract is one that I don’t think any other GM would be willing to touch, and Denver can’t do anything in free agency in terms of really bringing Jokic more help, Jamal Murray seems to be the odd man out here.


Murray had a great run in the 2020 bubble, but outside of then he’s mostly just been looking like an above average starting combo guard. He can create well enough for himself off the dribble, shoot pretty well, and provides some playmaking value, which could make him an enticing option for some teams, although the $160mil contract he’s currently on isn’t exactly team friendly either. I haven’t gone through a rundown of every team to find the one(s) that would bring back the most value, or that would even accept a trade for Murray, but given Denver’s options if they want to compete for and win a championship, it seems like pretty much the only way that they can go. Do you guys agree?


TLDR: Denver is in contract hell with the shitty MPJ contract and they’re way over the cap so they can’t do anything to get Jokic more help in FA, so presumably the only way they can get Jokic more help to compete for a title w/o gutting their defense and depth is trading Jamal Murray.",C-DogDriver,70,0,0.3

Not stuff like taking Giannis first overall when that was never a possibility at the time.

Like an example for the Sixers is they drafted Mikal Bridges in the lottery and traded him on the same day and/or Fultz not having a bizarre injury as the number 1 overall pick and/or letting Jimmy walk for Tobias Harris and Al Horford (ugh).  Obviously the butterfly effect would drastically change how the team operated if any of these came to pass but the Sixers werent that far away from:

PG: Harden

SG: Fultz

SF: Butler/Bridges

PF: Bridges/Butler

46,What kind of contract could a player like Kenny Smith in his prime get in todays league?,11vx3p8,"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smithke01.html

Talking about Kenny Smith from Inside the NBA. While he was never a superstar level player, he put up decent numbers and would probably be a starting guard  on a lot of teams in his prime. Would constantly get above 40 percent from 3 point shooting too.  

He averaged 17.7 ppg, 7.1 ast and 2.1 rebounds in his best statistical year which was his 6th season.

He was also able to average a similar stat line his sophomore season. 

I feel like he would have had a massive contract if it was negotiated after his 4th or 6th season, just going off the consistency and potential.

Beyond the stat line he was able to co exist with a superstar player like Hakeem and was able to bring out the best in each other. Valuable trait to have for teams that built around a star.",Aktor56,17,14,0.76

However, I believe, Luka Doncic had a contract with Real Madrid at the time of the NBA draft. I do not know if this is the case with Wembanyama, however, I believe he would not have a contract running past this year as is the case given the elite level of preparation with training and agents constructed around him and advising he probably received to sign a short-term deal.

But, if Wembanyama is still under contract, would his drafting team have to pay a transfer fee to Metropolitans 92? This phenomenon is not unheard of in other European sports. For example, when Cristiano Ronaldo went from Manchester United to Real Madrid, Real Madrid paid his former club 80M euros. I don't think Wembanyama would command more than a few million, but I'm sure any NBA team would pay it if given the opportunity to draft him in the NBA player.",JJWhatWhat,22,20,0.75

63,(O.C.) All the players who've been the best player on a championship going back 1969,11vrl05,"I think this is one of the true lists in this sport. It happens quite often where the guy who won MVP seems like the best player in the league, but then it's the guy who brought home the ring who really gets that praise. Giannis for instance, after the playoff exit in 2020 was getting widely slammed despite being a back to back mvp but, upon winning the ring in 2021, he became the top dog. Only 5 active players have done that. and the list of active nba players who've been the best player on a finals team but not win the ring isn't too long either. (Tatum, Booker, Jimmy Butler, and if you want you can include Dwight Howard since he's technically still playing basketball).

So let's list them I'll put the first year they did it, which should help for multiple time winners. I'll be starting from the latest.

**Any miscalculations here**

Let me explain any ""controversial"" picks I made in the making of the list here.  I am putting David Robinson as the best player on the 1999 Spurs as Duncan was still young, but I genuinely am unsure and will trust a random spurs fan on here if they say otherwise. I also have heard that Joe Dumars was up there with Isiah Thomas for those late 80s Pistons teams. and I think you can make the point for either Ben Wallace or Chauncey Billups for the 04 Pistons.

Also, I should note that I put Magic's first year as the best player on the champion lakers as 82. I wasn't sure if there was a solid argument for Kareem that year. I know for a fact Kareem was better in 1980. I am also putting Moses Malone, not Dr J as the best player on philly in 1983.

I'm not an expert on 70s basketball. I had trouble finding much about the 1979 Sonics, but Dennis Johnson seemed to have the superior accolades. I may have overrated Dave Cowens and maybe should have put havlicek in 1974 but cowens was the mvp in 1973 and John was older at that time so I made some assumptions.  Also, because I'm stopping at 1969, players who lead their teams to victory before that year(namely, Wilt and Bill Russell) will be getting credit at the first point in the timeline.

Hope that all makes sense.

1969: Bill Russell.

Edits: took out David Robinson for 1999 and  Joe Dumars for 1989. added in some other options for several teams in the 70s.  thanks u/[**bonziwellsayo**](https://www.reddit.com/user/bonziwellsayo/)**,** for that suggestion.

In total, that's about 27 unique players over a 54 year span, with the 70s having the most names with 8  unique mvps. where as the 2000s(the second highest) had 6 unique MVPS and the 80s and 90s had only 4 unique MVPS.

&#x200B;

If you cut it off at 1980, you get a pretty even average of a new best player on a finals team emerging 5 times per decade. and it's been 2 years since Giannis did it for the first time. Maybe this is a sign a new player will do it this year?

&#x200B;

of the 27 players only 6 never won an MVP award. The ones who didn't are Kawhi Leonard, whoever you pick from the 04 Pistons, Isiah Thomas, Dennis Johnson, and Rick Barry.

&#x200B;

Players who HAVE won MVP but are not, as of right now, on that list: Nikola Jokic(2020-21-2021-22), James Harden(2017-18), Russell Westbrook(2016-17) , Steve Nash (2004-05, 2005-06), Allen Iverson(2000-01)  Karl Malone(1996-97, 1998-1999) David Robinson (1994-95), Charles Barkley(1992-1993) Julius Erving(1980-81) and Bob mcadoo(1974-75). Note though that Dr. J and David Robinson did win a ring as a top 2 option on the team, unlike others on this list so i don't think they should count in the same way. 

&#x200B;

In compiling this I used [this list of previous finals MVPS](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/finals_mvp.html) and cross referenced it with a list of mvps from the same source (bball ref), and would clarify with wikipedia and LandofBasketball to be sure i was picking the right guy.

64,"De, Aaron Fox's game resemble Manu Ginobili + Nick Van Exel?",11vr76c,"I was thinking about Fox's crazy euro step move on Kuzma from last night's game, wondering where I had seen that before, and I just got reminded about it. Manu Ginobili. Did a quick search and came across this:

Watching Ginobili highlights, especially on his drives, I feel like you can definitely see some of what Fox is doing now from them. Same for Van Exel too in the pull-up middy game from his Dallas years. Both players get the left-handed ""shifty"" label.

>Information, Brooks has matched up in the half court defensively 922 times against this year’s All-Stars, the most of any player. He has held those All-Stars, from Tatum to Curry to Durant, to a 45.7% effective field goal percentage, which ranks first among the 72 players to record 400 such matchups. (League average, for comparison, is 54.6.) Among the players who have the most half-court matchups against All-Stars, Brooks is allowing the lowest percentage. In short, he has matched up against All-Stars more than any other NBA player, and he has defended them better than anybody else. Just one player - Lillard - has scored 40 against him this year.

Even the four teams to not qualify for the famous ""40 before 20"" rule all met this mark. ('95 Rockets, '04 Pistons, '06 Heat, '21 Bucks)

We tend to cite “pace and space” as the reason for the league’s scoring spike, but that wouldn’t explain the recent jump in FT%. The league FT% has been fairly steady for decades but it’s spiked recently.

There could be several factors for this —

— teams are playing fewer “bigs,” who traditionally aren’t good free throw shooters. They’re also running the offense through the post less often, which may mean fewer FT attempts for the big dudes who are still there.

— the league-wide emphasis on shooting may mean the perimeter players (guards and forwards) are better shooters than the past. We don’t see many defensive specialists anymore, or even traditional point guards who aren’t shooters (like a Rajon Rondo type.)",ZandrickEllison,33,150,0.96

After tonights win, the Sacramento Kings are only 4 games behind from the #1 Seed Nuggets in the East, with the final game of the season being Kings vs Nuggets on April 9th. Could Could the Kings win the West?

It certainly seems possible when we look at the remaining schedule for both teams.

Kings play:

* Jazz x 2
* Suns
* TWolves
* Trail Blazers x 2
* Pelicans
* Warriors
* Celtics
* Spurs
* Mavs
* Nuggets

The Kings Strength of Schedule is: 0.498 (source: [https://www.tankathon.com/remaining\_schedule\_strength](https://www.tankathon.com/remaining_schedule_strength))

The Nuggets play:

* Wizards
* 76ers
* Suns x 2
* Rockets
* Jazz
* Nets
* Bucks
* Pelicans
* Warriors

The Nuggets Strength of schedule is: .529. (source: [https://www.tankathon.com/remaining\_schedule\_strength](https://www.tankathon.com/remaining_schedule_strength))

It may very well come down to the final game of the season where the Kings have the chance to end the season with a BEAM and #1 Seed. The Kings need to win 3 more games than the Nuggets and then beat them in the final game of the season to achieve this (with about 10 games remaining to do so outside of the final game).",6lackDino,41,126,0.92

93,is it legal to offer a upper mid tier free agent a huge one year contract (well worth their value) with the caveat of signing a minimum the next year?,11vcap8,"



Let’s say your team (mid/large market) has a summer where a max slot (however it may cost in any given year) frees up, but no big stars are available, but, the next year - multiple top 5 players are - however, there are quite a few decent starters (like we’re talking B- to C tier dudes who are great contributes, think of guys worth 10/20 mil, for example. These guys can’t lead a team, but they’re very solid contributors. However, if you sign them to multi year deals - you lose out on your max slot. 


Now, what i want to ask if the following would be legal:

Let’s say you offer two of these players, who are normally worth 10-20mil each a huge one year contract. Ex. Two one year 30mil to them, and mention that they intend to sign a big star the next year, however, if you wish to win the championship, you must sign the minimum the next season. You don’t have to sign, you can even turn this down if another team pays you more, but just know that this is the only condition i would have to give you this large overpay for one year. 


Is such a thing legal? or would it count as tampering? you’re not giving them money under the table per say, you also aren’t making them commit to the min the next year and are basically giving the player to go to another team in the next summer if they so wish. The move does look suspicious, but is is legal?",KayRay1994,19,8,0.7

It's the exact opposite on the road, they can't figure out a rotation, some players are good and others aren't, and they may even struggle with simple shots

To be fair, I've only seen the games this season, but I mean these guys are last years champions with minimal roster changes. Shouldn't they be a lot more dominant? What does this mean if a team is only good at home while being lackluster on the road?",throwaway4513786,64,33,0.72

A lot of trash talk, a lot of shooting and the Memphis Grizzlies outplay the Warriors without Ja Morant yet again.

121,"With tonight’s loss against the Grizzlies, you guessed it, the Warriors once again have an inverse home-road record.",11v8owf,"Home: 29-7

Road: 7-29

What do I even say anymore? They have the 3rd worst road record and the 3rd best home record.

Early in the season it could be written off as them simply having bad luck, or missing shots, etc. At this point is it fair to say these are essentially two different teams? If this is the case, without home court advantage in any series, what are the odds we see them bounced in the first round in 5-6? 

Furthermore, with the West play in race being so tight, it’s plausible they end up the 8 seed or worse the 9 seed and potentially have to play one of the games on the road. Many have already pencilled in the Warriors as a playoff team, but with a rough schedule and plenty of road games left, there’s absolutely no guarantee they stay afloat. 

All this to say, if the Warriors miss the playoffs, or they get bounced early in an uncompetitive series, will we see this core broken up in the offseason?",william4534,51,362,0.95

129,Jakob Poeltl: The Most Underrated Center in the League,11v7yb6," 

I'm here to make a case for why Jakob Poeltl is the most valuable center in the league and how he can help the Raptors return to championship contention.

First off, let's take a look at his stats. Poeltl is averaging 9.4 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks per game this season. While those numbers may not jump off the page, he's doing it all while shooting a remarkable 65.7% from the field. That's second-best in the league among centers with at least 5 field goal attempts per game, behind only Rudy Gobert.

But it's not just his efficiency that makes him valuable. Poeltl is an elite rim protector, ranking fourth in the league in blocks per game. He alters shots and forces opponents to alter their game plan when attacking the basket.

But where Poeltl really shines is in his ability to set screens and roll to the rim. He's an excellent pick-and-roll player, and his ability to finish at the rim makes him a perfect fit for the modern NBA. He's currently averaging 1.34 points per roll, which is fourth-best in the league among centers with at least 3 rolls per game.

Now, I know what some of you are thinking. ""But what about Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokic? They're the best centers in the league!"" And while they're certainly great players, I would argue that Poeltl is more valuable to his team than either of them.

The Raptors have struggled this season, but Poeltl has been a bright spot. When he's on the court, the team has a net rating of +2.1. When he's off the court, that drops to -4.9. That's a massive swing, and it shows just how important he is to the team's success.

But the real reason why Poeltl is so valuable is because of his contract. He's currently making just $8.3 million per year, which is a bargain for a player of his caliber. With his current contract, the Raptors have the flexibility to add more talent around him and Pascal Siakam this offseason.

Jakob Poeltl is the most underrated center in the league. He's an elite rim protector, an excellent pick-and-roll player, and he's doing it all while shooting an absurdly high percentage from the field. He's also incredibly valuable to the Raptors, and his team-friendly contract gives them the flexibility they need to build a championship contender. Don't sleep on Poeltl, he's a future All-Star in the making.",SpicaComeBack,38,0,0.39
130,"The Sixers just played their 9th game in March ... Joel Embiid scored 325 POINTS in 303 MINUTES, through those 9 games!

But their current team looks primed to be one of the leading contenders of the East and frankly the title.

The West is looking kind of weak at the moment and a betting man would favor a champion from the East. Of the three main contenders (Sixers, Bucks and Celtics), Embiid may be having the strongest season of any player. They have figured out the Harden/Embiid PnR and have a reliable 3rd option in Maxey and have looked like the strongest team in the league since the All-Star break.

147,Why have the Bucks been so much better than last season regular season wise?,11v578q,"This Season with 12 games to go, the Bucks have already won 50 games and will likely be the 1 seed.

Last season the Bucks won just 51 games and got only the 3 seed.

Why have they been so much better this year in the regular season than last season? If I had to take a guess I would say because Brook Lopez has stayed healthy throughout this season unlike last season where he was out for most of the season.

Anyways why have the Bucks been much better this season in the regular season than last season?",Disastrous_Day_2166,35,16,0.71
148,[Discussion] Isn't it a bit strange to have zero teams with great point differentials?,11v4nun,"2019-20: Bucks had season avg of +10.1, and the Raptors, Celtics, Clippers were all over +6.0.

2020-21: Jazz had a +9.2 and the Clippers had a +6.2, with several others trailing close behind.

2021-22: Suns had a +7.5, Celtics had +7.3, and Warriors had +6.5.

This year: Zero teams above +6.0, and only two teams above +5.0 -- the Cavs at +5.6 and the Celtics at +5.4.

What do we think is the reason for this? League-wide parity? A lack of great teams or bottom teams? Interested to hear what people think.

157,Are the Denver Nuggets contenders or pretenders?,11v1knw,My gut says they're the latter even though I'm a big fan of Jokic. I just think they lack a real second star.

If they had like a Paul George or a Demar Derozan in addition to Jokic and Murray then I think they'd be a real threat. What do you all think?,RaiseLive1654,188,41,0.64

161,Worst award winning seasons from players in the last 25 years,11v16rw,"Who is the worst player to win each award in the span of 1998-2022? And I don't mean worst player in terms of career but worst seasons to win every major award. If you think 25 years is going too far back I'll try to include modern examples. Awards/honors to be omitted from this are all-defensive team, all-rookie team, stat leader titles like steals leader, all the character/community work awards, and All-Star Game MVP (b/c nobody gives a shit in the ASG)

Final disclaimer, **I'm not saying any of these players are bad because that's dumb to say that, I'm just comparing it to all other winners of the same award**

_______________________________

**MVP** - Karl Malone 98-99

This was the worst season in the given time frame pretty easily, MJ retired, lockout shortened, pace was slow as hell, no star player really stood out or had that great of a year. They had to give it to someone so they chose Malone. What's funny about this one is that Karl Malone's numbers were down than years prior, like this was his 10th highest season in PPG pretty sure. Other candidates would be Iverson in 01, Rose in 11, Nash in 05, Curry in 15 was kinda weak. Again great seasons but keep in mind it's compared to other MVPs

**FMVP** - Andre Iguodala 14-15

Not saying the man didn't deserve the award but come on, he was given it for being the most effective at stopping Lebron even though he still put up 36/13/9. Let's be honest, either Lebron or Steph should have won

**DPOY** - Marcus Camby 06-07

Should have been Duncan's, Camby is also the only retired DPOY never to be an all-star in his career. Other answers for this, and both of these will get shit, Kawhi's second DPOY in 2016 which should have been Draymond's, and Marcus Smart in 2022 which was questionable to say the least. I mean come on Gobert and Giannis were better defenders and he wasn't even the best defender on the team last finals (timelord)

**Sixth Man** - Jamal Crawford 2015-16

This one stuck out to me because 35 year old Crawford was absolutely not a better 6th man than someone like Iguodala. Not that it really matters but it was purely a reputation award or a name they associate with the trophy. Pretty sure he won it over Ginobili in another year too

**ROY** - Mike Miller 00/01

Respect to Mike Miller and everything but that draft was straight booty cheeks and Miller would average 12/4/2 on 29 minutes. But then again there is Malcolm Brogdon with 10/3/4 on 26 minutes in 2016-17, honestly take your pick

**Hustle Award** - Amir Johnson 17-18

Dumbass award lol but why Amir Johnson? I don't think even 6ers fans know

**Most Improved Player** - Alan Henderson 97-98

I'll be honest, I don't know who this guy is. He put up 14/6/1 and played for the Hawks. You can maybe say Monte Ellis in 06-07 putting up 17/3/4 on the Baron Davis Warriors. idk

**All-NBA First Team** - DeAndre Jordan 15-16

Another tough one because of course there wont be any bad players here but it's gotta be him or Marc Gasol in 14-15. DeAndre Jordan was a great player, one of the best defenders in the league (behind Draymond and Kawhi at that time but still), elite rebounder, elite rim protector, great at setting screens, highest FG% and efficiency at that time. But let's face it, it was a weak era for centers. People will say Joakim Noah but I remember each of these years and I'd put him ahead of DAJ or Gasol

**All-NBA Second Team** - Vin Baker 97-98

Baker was playing for the Sonics and was putting up 19/8/2, of course it was a great season but he was 11th in scoring and was competing with Shaq, Robinson, Webber, Mutombo, etc... at the same position. Maybe I'm being biased towards big names though in this case. Modern example? Uhhhhh... Julius Randle 2 years ago? Maybe Siakam in 2020. Again it's hard to say and I'm not trying to hate on these guys or anything, someone who knows more should comment if I'm off base

**All NBA-Third Team** - Eddie Jones 99-00

Put up 20/4/5 on the Hornets. Marbury the same year put up 22/3/8 on a bad Nets team, pretty empty stats. As you can gather it wasn't the strongest era for NBA talent. But modern examples again? Maybe Bogut in 2010, David Lee in 2013, Shaq in 2009

I don't really feel like doing all-defensive teams very much since I don't know how to judge defensive ability or whatever criteria. Knowing about different basketball players than your team was different up until 10 or so years ago because cable TV is all you had. Same for all-rookie teams, there isn't a way to compare players without it taking all day basically so I'll skip them. But here are some bonus awards for non-players:

**Coach of the Year**- Sam Mitchell 06-07

He was the coach of the Raptors who went 47-35 to make 3rd in conference that year, it was his only winning season on not that good of a team. Speaking of Raps coaches, Dwane Casey 17-18 is probably #2 for worst

**Executive of the Year** - Elgin Baylor 05-06

This one is tough because it was probably seen as a great year (47-35, 6th in conference) but Baylor is not fondly remembered as Clippers GM. They would go back to being >.500 the year after and he had only 2 winning seasons in 10 years, but the worst owner in NBA history was running the organization so how much can you blame Elgin. Other candidates are Masai Ujiri in for the 2013 Nuggets, great season but Morey should have won

**Western Conference Champion**: 2006 Mavericks

The West wins the title most of the time, it's crazy looking at finalists considering 16/25 have won and those who didn't were mostly repeat finalists. But I go with 06 Mavs for this one because of a comparably mediocre roster around Dirk and Dirk was still in his choker days. I'll talk more about this finals later but they were the worst interior D the Heat had faced and they didn't double Wade. But other acceptable answers for this are the 04 Lakers for being washed/chemistry issues, or 2021 Suns for last 10 years

**Eastern Conference Champion**: 2002 Nets

Honestly chose your pick between that or the 03 Nets, the East was just complete garbage and either team probably loses in the first round if they were in the West. In 03 they made it to the finals with a piping hot 49-33 record and they were coached by Byron Scott. Other answers for this would be 01 Sixers, 07 Cavs, 20 Heat

**NBA Champion** - 2006 Miami Heat

Ignoring all the controversy with the refs/calls in the final, this isn't that great of a roster. Sure you had Wade at his best and Shaq in his last prime year (put up 14/10/3 in the finals series however) but Haslem, Jason Williams, and Antoine Walker were the starters and washed up Zo, GP, Derek Anderson were depth.

Notable years:

2002- Lakers win a wcf against SAC that looked blatantly fixed

2006- DWade shoots more freethrows than the entire Mavs team

2012- Miami Heat get some very favorable refereeing against a baby Thunder team

2015- Okc, Memphis, and Rockets plagued by injuries so the west is wide open. Warriors face an injured Cavs team in the finals without Kyrie and Love

2016- Green is suspended in the finals

2017/18- Durant Warriors superteam rings

2019- Raptors beat Sixers with a lucky bounce game winner. Beat Warriors with no Kd and Klay get’s injured

2020- The infamous bubble (mickey mouse) playoffs 

2021- Bucks get a very luck break against the Nets when iron man Harden suddenly has an injured hamstring. Kyrie goes down after Nets are up big. Kd still nearly pulls off the upset but an inch saves the Bucks season and their coach’s career. 

2022- Warriors beat Den without MPJ and Murray. Beat Grizzlies without Ja then face a weak Mavs team that upset the Suns.",SlimReaper35_,111,0,0.18

""Perusing around @bball_ref and found that the #Suns have shot more FT's than their opponent 23 times in 70 games (33% of games).

That is fourth lowest in the league by percentage:""


[](https://imgur.com/63ATWCB.jpg)

Some interesting tidbits are the Lakers out shooting opponents at the free throw line 72% of the time! 

Also,  the Bucks which are towards the bottom of the league in free throw attempts per game end up outshooting their opponents in 51% of the games. I'd be really curious on the opponents that the bucks are regularly outshooting. Pretty sure most of them are playoff opponents.

I'm starting to think that free throw attempts per game is not really a good gauge on whether a team is receiving a fair whistle. I think first percentage of time out shooting an opponent/quality of opponent is a much better indicator.",Jesmer8490,40,30,0.81

169,Is Gary Harris’ 3 point shot back?,11uyk1b,"Gary Harris used to be a very good young player. He could shoot, make some plays, and defend. Unfortunately, starting in the 2018-19 season he went from a good shooter to mediocre. From 2015-16 to 2017-18 he shot 38.9% from 3, but could not reach 38% in any season out of his next 3. In those next 3 seasons he shot 33.7% from 3 and lost a lot of his value as a player. Now though, he looks like he may have found his shot again. In the last 2 seasons he is shooting 39.9% in 100 games. He’s been above 38% in both seasons and this season he is at 42.5%.

Just to be clear, I don’t think the 3 point shot is the only reason Gary Harris fell off the map. He’s dealt with a lot of injuries and his 2p% also fell off. However, I do think he can be a useful player in a good team’s rotation if he continues to shoot like this.

Luka 
Dame 

Those are the only PGs I could take over Trae. I honestly don’t see an argument for Ja, Fox, Garland, or Hali, just because Trae had a rough start to this season. 

27 and 10 on good efficiency doesn’t just grow on trees and Trae has basically been doing that since his 2nd year at 20 years old, and now he’s playing solid defense too. 

With Quin Snyder as his new coach, he’s 
27/4/9 on 48/41/90 so far after 9 games. 

And obviously we’ll see what happens in the playoffs but as long as the Hawks aren’t facing the Heat, even if they lose in round 1 I think Trae will bounce back from his performance last year. 

Next year we could see an MVP-like breakout season from Trae…

178,"De'Aaron ""I'm F**king Nice"" Fox - Game Icing Stats (with video)",11uw3oo,"We've all seen Fox's excellent 4th quarter and clutch time stats, but I was curious: how many times this year has he been the one to actually ice the game?

I have a bunch of grading and lesson planning to do, so instead I just spent an hour going back through game logs and highlight videos.

I looked at two categories:

* Fox Game Winners - Fox scores the go-ahead bucket, and that is the final points of the game (I kinda cheated on this for a couple of them). I also looked to see how many of these were buzzer-beaters.
* Fox Daggers - I defined these as any game where Fox hit the Kings' final field goal, followed by some Kings FTs because of intentional fouling.

Here are the results:

The King have won 26 games by a single digit margin this year. In those games...

Fox has **7 game winners** (again two are a slight stretch but I'm counting them), a whopping four (!!) of which were buzzer beaters. 

* 11/5 @ Orlando, he hits the [unforgettable logo buzzer-beater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu1OZ4M6Cjc) to win it 126-123
* 12/14 @ Toronto, he drives to the rim and draws the foul with 0:05, and goes 1-2 to put the Kings up 3. On the next possession Siakim hits the putback after a missed FVV three, so this one is kinda cheating, but Kings don't win in regulation without that free throw.
* 1/3 @ Utah, [he hits the driving layup as time expires](https://youtu.be/tKXRDPZijNs?t=435) (call on the floor was that he didn't get it off in time, overturned on review) to win 117-115 (this is after Markkanen draws the 3 shot foul with 16 seconds to go and hits all three to tie)
* 2/8 @ Houston, [he draws the three shot foul from *Eric Gordon as time expires and hits all three](https://youtu.be/qaSTT5rsxqM?t=409), to win 130-128
* 2/11 vs. Dallas, he gets to the FT line three times in the last 18 seconds of OT, going 6/6 to win 133-128 (you could call this a bit of a stretch, but the Kings needed every single one of those six points)
* 2/24 @ LAC [he hits the go-ahead 2-point pullup jumper at 0:36 in 2OT](https://youtu.be/IUqEYXRn4HA?t=445), after creating that possession by picking Mason Plumlee's pocket. These are the last points of the game. Honorable mention for [assisting Monk's insane game-tying 3](https://youtu.be/bWc_-_DIFXA?t=105) to force OT in the first place. Kings win 176-175

The thing that really stands out to me: 6/7 game winners are on the road, a huge reason for the Kings' conference best road record of 21-13.

In addition to the 7 game-winners, he hit another 3 daggers, which I define as times where he hit the Kings' final FG of the win, followed only by Kings FTs on intentional fouls.

* 11/11 @ LAL, he [drains a turnaround fadeaway 2](https://youtu.be/1CQTw5I1qz0?t=432) with 0:32 to go
* 11/20 vs. Detroit, [he hits the two-point stepback](https://youtu.be/pMKX1-7jqa4?t=422) with 0:56 to go
* 1/20 vs. OKC, [he hit a layup to ice the game at 0:01](https://youtu.be/WMwjbMqEdls?t=437) (the Kings were already up 3 at the time, but it ended a flurry of OKC scoring)

But the refs have been abysmal this season.. I dont know what the solution is but from what I've seen this year, its time for a convo.

1) Consistency- They need to call the game according to the RULES. They called a travel on a Curry stepback yesterday that they rarely ever call. Its like the ref decided he didn't like Curry for one play. These players routinely travel and carry and the refs call it at their leisure. Gotta stop. 


2) Recognition of a foul- Hunter went up for a dunk last night and got hit 100% on the arm and ended up getting a tech. Ive seen this routinely all year long even when it helped my Hawks out. In fact, last night I saw multiple times where we body checked Curry and the ref called nothing. Blatent foul. Appreciate it this time refs. But enough is enough. When is a foul a foul every time?

3) Superstar calls. I recently saw an interview in which a player stated Kobe told him that "" you know they not calling a foul on me in the 4th quarter. "" The Shaq rules were another example.

205,Alex Caruso’s Defensive RAPTOR is the highest by a guard since the stat has been tracked,11umco0,"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Alex%20Caruso&season=2023

This season, Caruso’s DRAPTOR is +5.9, by far the highest in the league. The next closest is Anthony Davis at +5.2. 

Over the last nine seasons (the lifetime of the stat), only 3 guards crack the Top 30. 

Alex Caruso’s current season ranks 1st All-Time for guards, and 5th All-Time for all positions (1st and 2nd All-Time belong to Rudy Gobert) 

2nd place All-Time for guards again goes to Alex Caruso for the 2021-2022 season. 

3rd All-Time, and the only other guard in the Top 30 in DRAPTOR, is Tony Allen in the 2014-2015 season. Tony Allen was 33 at the time, so imo it’s very likely both him and Kobe Bryant would be the other guards near Caruso’s level if the stat covered all of the 2000s.

For me it's a bit of a homer take but I think Quickley could put up some big numbers on good efficiency if he was given a bigger role on offense.

The loss dropped the Mavs to 34-33 and the 8th seed due to losing the tiebreaker to the Wolves.

Luka has not played in the 4 games since then. Kyrie has also missed 3 of those 4 games. We lost to the Grizzlies twice (after which many Mavs fans thought our season was over), beat the Spurs in overtime after trying our hardest to lose, and beat the Lakers off a miracle game-winner.

Yet somehow, the Mavs *gained* ground in the playoff race. We're now 6th in the West thanks to the Warriors going 2-3 since then and the Wolves going 1-3.

It’s been nearly 4 years since the all star forward was traded from the Toronto Raptors to the San Antonio Spurs for Kawhi Leonard.

In the 2018-2019 season, Leonard went on to lead the Raptors to their first and only NBA title.

DeRozan left the Raptors as the all time leading scorer, but could never get the team over the hump in the postseason.

Since the trade in 2018, DeRozan has played for both the Spurs and the Bulls. He’s continued to play at an all star level, but his team(s) have not had success in the playoffs.

247,Embiid in last 2 games vs Jokic: 41/14/5 on 68 TS%. Jokic: 23/11/9 on 68 TS%,11ubrka,"As much debate as there is about who is the best center in the league and who is MVP, I think there last 2 matchups have been interesting. Both have won one game a piece, but Embiid has outplayed Jokic H2H and visually looks like the better player with more dominant scoring and defense when they play each other. Embiid can defend and slow down Jokic much better than Jokic can defend Embiid.

In 7 games of his career vs Embiid, Jokic averages 22/8/7 on 60 TS%. Jokic is also 2-5 vs Embiid H2H. 

In 7 games vs Jokic, Embiid averages 26/12/4/2 on 57 TS%. Embiid is also 5-2 vs Jokic in his career. 

Their overall career matchups, shows Embiid outplays Jokic H2H and his team is also winning the matchup as well.

248,Who is the WORST player in the NBA that could take a 16 seed to a championship?,11ublft,"In honor of March Madness and FDU’s win over Purdue it got me thinking, who is the worst nba player that you could throw on the roster of a 16 seed in the ncaa tournament and expect them to win the title? I started thinking about this after someone asked if Giannis on a 16 seed would win the title on the Bucks’ sub (the answer was a resounding yes). I’m curious how bad of a player (by nba standards) could theoretically pull this off.",ahkallday,64,0,0.5
249,Whats the next great MVP race going to be?,11ubkgx,"So i think Giannis vs Embiid vs Jokic for the 3rd straight year is turning out to be one of the greatest MVP races of all time


Before this we had


Harden vs the world

Lebron vs KD

Shaq vs AI 

Lebron vs Kobe 



What players will be dueling it for MVP over the next few years?


Imo after this threesome i think Luka, Tatum, SGA will be having crazy races over the next few years",StormSaniWater,23,14,0.66

263,Finally it is clear to me. The secret to Steph Curry's success is that he never stopped shooting his little kid shot.,11u9kre,"I was always a bit confused by Wardell Stephen Curry II. He seems like a normal player, but he's the best shooter ever. Better than Bird, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen. But why? Usually you don't get to be the BOAT at something unless, beyond your determination, have some serious uncommon advantages. I was never sure what it was with him. But now I see. It's little kid power.

So... [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtYJTAsNmg), you can see Steph warming up with his Dad when he was a kid. Obviously, he's heaving the ball at the basket in one motion like you usually do when you're a kid and your forearm and wrist alone aren't strong enough to get the ball to the basket (and I guess you're shorter too and need more arc). 

I think for most of us, when we get to be around 14, we start shooting a normal ""adult"" two-motion shot, with just our arm. But now that I think about it, we really have to learn that shooting form from scratch at that age. So if you enter the NBA at 21, you have at most 7 years of reps with your jump shot.

But Steph Curry *never changed his form*. Apparently he started playing rec league games when he was 6-years-old. So when he went into the NBA, he actually had 15 years of reps. 8 extra years of practice.

On top of that, as we can see in the video, he was flinging NBA 3-pointers from the time he was a little kid too. When he was nowhere near strong enough in the arms to get it to the basket normally. So he learned to use his legs and arms in his shot to give extra power to his heave while not losing any control. Throwing the ball from beyond wrist-flick range is what he's ALWAYS been doing. It just so happened that when he got to be grown-man size, that same practice let him step back to 30-feet easily.

That is all. Maybe some of you already knew this. But I wanted to share anyway.",EGarrett,22,32,0.68
264,Moving Screens in the Paint,11u8ori,"These fake box outs that come way, way before the shot gets released need to be addressed, either by the rules committee or by making them a point of emphasis. There’s a lot of talk about the scoring explosion and what’s causing it, and I don’t think this gets brought up enough. The way games are called right now, bigs can seal the help defender and basically block them like an offensive lineman as their teammate takes the open layup. It’s a moving screen and it should be called. It’s gotten worse over the last few years but this year I feel like I’m seeing it on every drive.",jakehightower,11,27,0.85

292,Game #70 - Raptors vs Thunder: Post-Game Analysis,11tzxhz,"Hi r/NBA, I've mainly been using the r/torontoraptors sub to make these posts, mainly because this sub doesn't allow me to post individual pictures, but I think I've found bypass that through twitter pics. I'd like to test out one post here and see if you guys enjoy some in-depth analysis.

# Highlight of Game

Thankfully the Raptors made this one easy today:

[As Scottie is crossing the half you see him take a look back at Yak to signal to him to hustle up the floor. From the block to the no-look to the poster, this play felt like the Showtime Lakers.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/q1irc2keqboa1/player)

# Player of the Game 

I've been Pascal Siakam's biggest critic since the deadline, as he's had **4 games** where he's **scored 15 or less points** in March**,** having only 3 such games before this month.

He finally did a good job at reading the help defense, finishing with **25/14/8** with **4 threes.** Since the Raptors have been fully healthy, Siakam is the only starter with a **negative NET RTG.** He was a **+6** last night, playing a healthy **34 minutes** and being tagged with the responsibility of leading the bench. 

I had to give today's player of the game to **Pascal Siakam**. He needed this game, and I hope he's able to string along some good performances as we close the season out (or not and we win Wemby).

# How the game was put away

I thought the Raptors were always always in control of this game, holding a **9 point lead** until the **8 minute mark** of the 4th, where Scottie Barnes subbed back in and we simply put away the game, here are some plays that I thought contributed to it:

[Isaiah Joe tries to blow by Gary Trent Jr Twice, fails and takes a contested jumper.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/2ury9envtboa1/player)

I made a point that whether or not his offence is going, Gary needs to stay aggressive and effective defensively. The first time Joe drives Scottie is there to help in the paint while constantly looking at Giddey. This play also shows the presence of Yak presence defensively, the second time that Joe tried to drive, Poeltl sagged off his player to help Trent if Joe wanted to finish at the rim. 

When defended by Poeltl, attacking players shoot **37.6%** between **5-9 feet** so Joe technically did take a better shot, but this is still perfect defense by Trent Jr. Additionally, Poeltl contested a team-high **18 shots** and held opponents to a crazy **7/24** when defended by him.

[Scottie does a great job of recognizing the mismatch and sealing Shai down-low, if he postered Vucevic, I'm sorry Lu Dort you're getting postered too. ](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/xzwhf0lbwboa1/player)

Reddit only allows me 5 videos, so let me break this one down step-by-step:

* Scottie grabs and offensive rebound, gets the switch from Giddey to Shai
* Once Siakam gets the ball, they do a great job of moving the ball (and the Thunder do a great job rotating) to force the Thunder into more mismatches. 
* Both Fred and Gary had good shots that they usually take, but instead they find Poeltl on single coverage
* Scottie cuts to the basket, seals Shai (ref misses a foul with Shai wrapping his arms around Scottie)
* Easy dunk over Dort.

[Transition 3 and that's good night folks.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/9i73jlnuyboa1/player)

The Raptors get criticized a lot for help defense, deservedly so, but this is a perfect example of knowing when to help, and I want you to pay attention to Scottie Barnes' eyes defensively. As soon as Dort makes the pass his focus is on what Giddey is going to create.

Scottie realizes that Giddey has his head down and can only see the left side of the court, and comes over from the to help immediately. When Giddey spins, there's a surprise waiting for him. 

4 Thunder players collapse on Siakam in transition, and instead of forcing contact and trying to draw a foul, he uses the space to find Trent Jr , who shoots **40%** on **wide-open** **threes.**

These were the 3 plays that I thought put the game away but here are some other **4th quarter notes**:

* The Raptors held the Thunder to **0 field goals** for over a **4-minute stretch**
* We were **+7 on the glass** and **+16% shooting from the field** compared to them
* Siakam didn't force, he had **5 assists, 0 turnovers,** and only took **3 shots**
* Scottie and Poeltl dominated with **16/10/2** with **2 stocks**

# The Good, The Bad, No Ugly

I usually do 3 good things, 3 bad things, one ugly thing. But yesterday was genuinely one of the best games I've seen this team play and I really can't think of many bad things.

**5 Good Things**

1. Everyone chipped in. In 2020, the Raptors became the first team to have **5 or more players** average **15+ PPG** in a season. Well they did it again last year, and they're doing it again this year. They also did it last night, but instead had **6 players** who scored **15 points** or more. Poeltl has been averaging just under **15PPG** with the Raptors this year, so maybe they could become the first (?) team do have 6 players do it.
2. Nick Nurse did a great job of splitting Siakam and Scottie's minutes, which is something I know fans have been calling for. This season, they average over **29 MPG** together**,** and yesterday they only played **21 minutes** together, partly due to foul trouble with OG and Poeltl (it would've been closer to 17 minutes). Regardless I think it's key to split their minutes for spacing, specifically in single coverage isolations.
3. The Raptors are **2-0** since I've added the keys to the game section (I'll elaborate lol). After the game vs Denver I said the matchup between Scottie and OG vs Giddey and JDub  (Thunder fans, I absolutely love him, he's just about as good as OG was last year, be excited) is key. Scottie and OG: **37/12/7/1TO** on **14/24** from the **field,** **5 stocks** and a **+14** on the floor together. Giddey and JDub: **28/14/4/5TO** on **10/22** from the **field, 2 stocks,** and a **-9** on the floor together. All these players are awesome, and these two-man pairings will be key to these teams future success.
4. The Raptors dominated them on the glass and in transition. Outrebounding them by **20**, with **44 points in transition vs 19** for the Thunder. In addition **23 2nd chance PTs** to their **6.**
5. Scottie Barnes has absolutely been a mid-range monster in the Month of March, just take a look at his [shot chart](https://twitter.com/6ixin6ix_/status/1636753803822153728?s=46&t=qyM1qIw-Y3F7679x-MiQOw&fbclid=IwAR0tn_ZH0-htq3rCFnXDJYoKv9Dph5Le3PcCAP5GbNT5lL-oDZDzlo7PKaA). Here's a look at why he's dominating that right side mid-range:

[Please excuse the quality.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/jqtcqqwwbcoa1/player)

His length is problematic. Teams are used to him getting into the paint and going for a hook shot or fadeaway (like he did against Giddey in this clip) and they usually send help as he's been shooting **46%** on those shots from the free throw line range. His ability to create shots on islands where teams can't really help (without giving up a high quality shot off a pass) is going to be important for his offensive developments because teams can't double him on island iso's because of his playmaking ability.

**1 Bad Thing**

1. Precious Achiuwa, welcome to the dog house buddy :(

**One Ugly**

Nothing :)

# One Sentence Review, One Sentence Preview

**Review**

I really hope this team isn't playing with my emotions by pretending to be good for a few days and then fall off a cliff and never reach .500 this season.

**Preview**

Rudy Gobert, you're about to be put in a pick and roll torture chamber pal. 

# 3 Keys to Minnesota 

1. Attack Rudy Gobert off mismatches. Opposing teams shoot **56%** in the paint against him (both RA and non-RA). Against the Thunder I said managing the two-man game between Poeltl and whoever is running the PnR is important. We outscored The Thunder **30-10** on **points off screens.**
2. More Christian Koloko. He has the Raptors highest **NET RTG** this year, and it always confused me why Nick removed him from the rotation when he was our only center. I think placing him in a backup role where he can keep the defensive intensity that Poeltl brings is key going forward. He contested **7 shots** in only **12 minutes** yesterday.

If that number increases just a tiny bit the rest of the season, he will average a triple-double on the season.

**Triple-double seasons:**

Russell Westbrook (x4)  
Oscar Robertson (x1)  
potentially Nikola Jokic (x1)  

**2+ block / 2+ steal seasons:**

Hakeem Olajuwon (x4)  
David Robinson (x1)  
Gerald Wallace (x1)  

The triple-double is a sign of extreme versatility, generally on offense. The 2blk / 2stl in many ways could be considered the defensive version of it. Should Nikola Jokic join Russ and Big O, each statistical feat would have one player who has done it exactly 4 times, two players that have done it exactly once, and nobody else in league history.

They also had Vernon Carey Jr., but he got waived on March 1st,2023 (wishing him luck finding a new team).

**Orlando Magic:** None (though I swear I thought they had one).

**Charlotte Hornets:** Kelly Oubre Jr. & JT Thor.

They also had Mason Plumlee for 56 GP, but he got traded on February 9th, 2023 to the Clippers. I think he is the only one to get ~~Right~~ Left on [BBref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/plumlma01.html).

301,Is Brook Lopez the 3rd best center in the league?,11txewa,"Hello r/nba,

At the center position the two obvious top dogs are Embiid and Jokic. However who is 3rd, in your minds? Traditionally this would be KATs spot but he’s been hurt all year. This got me thinking, there’s Bam, Brook, AD?, and Sabonis (is he a center or PF?). 

Bam is another great defensive center who has a nice offensive game (especially the middy he’s developed). 

Sabonis is a jokic-lite type offensive hub but bad defensively. 

AD is clearly better but his position is unclear, he’s constantly hurt, and plays with inconsistent effort. 

Then there’s Brook. Who’s better defensively than Bam and Sabonis (Bam is close he’s just not as good a rim protector). On par with AD defensively. Plus he’s a far better outside shooter, has a nice float game, is a good screen setter; etc. 

Where would you guys rank him at his position? Am I crazy for ranking him this high?

Edit: I may be undervaluing Bam. 90% of the time I watch him his matchup is Joel Embiid, which basically never goes his way. I may be overvaluing brook based on how he plays Embiid, which is better than anyone in the league at the moment.",Fun-Pass-5651,114,0,0.34

But I don't get this knowledge. Warriors brought Donte Divencenzo who is much more respected role player than GP2 was and he is shooting career high from three, they brought Jamychal Green who is a better player than Bjelica and OPJ and also shooting career high from threes. Warriors brought the players that can be replacements and they still struggle defensively. For wiggins case, they lost to alot of tanking teams on the road even with Andrew Wiggins on the road.

So I think there is other reason than missing old players. Their role players are good enough to replace players from last year. Is there chemistry issue because how Draymond punched JP?

 The Bulls lost the first three games of the 1990-1991 season. They did not lose three in a row again until the 1993-1994 season.

After Phil Jackson assumed duties as coach of the Lakers in 1999, they did not lose three in a row until February 19, 2002.

The Lakers lost three in a row on January 27, 2008. They acquired Pau Gasol shortly thereafter and did not lose three in a row again until March 7, 2010.

People are gonna probably wonder why they're so high on the Cavs and low on the Bucks, here is the reasoning


> Since 1983-84, 36 of 39 champions have had a point differential of plus-4 per game or better—and this season, only the Celtics, Cavaliers, and Nuggets fit that criterion. If you’re wondering why the Cavaliers’ title odds look so strong here, that’s the main reason: They’re neck and neck with Boston for the best Pythagorean record in the NBA.


----

> Riding a 12-game winning streak, the Bucks are only half a game behind the Celtics for first place, but they have benefited from a league-best 22-6 record in “clutch” games—and there’s no correlation between clutch performance in the regular season versus the playoffs. The Bucks’ point differential is also just plus-3.2 per game, which ranks only fourth in the East.

That pick ended up being the 22nd pick in the 2022 draft.

As you're likely aware, teams typically have until 2pm ET to make draft day trades of picks being swapped for each other. After that point, the teams are required to make the picks and then trade the players. On draft night in 2022, close to 9pm ET, the Grizzlies agreed to a deal with the Timberwolves to receive the 19th pick. [The Timberwolves received picks 22 and 29](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1540151959273017344?s=20) from the Grizzlies.

But since it was past 2pm ET, Memphis had to make selections on behalf of the Timberwolves (and vice versa) and then the players were traded. So Walker Kessler was selected at 22 by the Grizzlies, but on behalf of the Timberwolves, and then promptly traded.

On July 1, the Jazz traded Rudy Gobert to the Timberwolves. In return, they received [Malik Beasley, Patrick Beverley, Walker Kessler, Jarred Vanderbilt and multiple first-round picks](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1542956279546740736?s=20).

320,Joel Embiid Takes Over No. 1 Spot in Kia MVP Ladder: Is he the Favorite for the Award?,11tt0bb,"Joel Embiid has overtaken Nikola Jokic as the top MVP candidate according to the latest Kia MVP ladder rankings. Embiid's seven consecutive 30-point performances have helped him claim the top spot, while Jokic and the Denver Nuggets have struggled as of late. The betting odds have also shifted in Embiid's favor, with multiple sportsbooks making him the favorite to win the award.

Embiid's dominant performances have been a key factor in the Philadelphia 76ers' six-game winning streak, which has catapulted them into the top four of the Eastern Conference. His latest performance against the Cleveland Cavaliers included 36 points and 18 rebounds, while also sparking a controversial call that went in his favor.

While Giannis Antetokounmpo remains a threat at No. 3 on the ladder, Embiid's recent form has put him in prime position to win his first MVP award. However, as the race for playoff seeding heats up, there is no guarantee that Embiid will maintain his current form or status as the favorite for the award.

The nuggets for the most part seem like the best team in the conference from wire to wire, albeit with some losses strung together lately

Grizzlies, although in near the top, are without Morant for 9 games, it'll be interesting to see if chemistry is an issue or they slip from a top spot

The KINGS?!?! Talk about a Cinderella season, they could very well finish #2 or #3, and possibly make the world end by making it to the finals Ala the 2021 sun's (Ling playoff drought snapped,  followed by a run through the conference)

The Warriors are very jekyll and Hyde on the home vs road, but are hovering in that top 6 spot and do have the experience of long playoff runs

The Clippers seem inconsistent and can't string together too any wins together, but still hover in that top 6

The Sun's got KD, it's all a matter of making that chemistry work and surging to the top half of the conference 

There is a very real possibility we will see a first time finals appearance from a team coming out of the West. With about 10 games to go, who do you think can make it out and why?

Not saying it's wrong or right but now Kareem as top 3 is pretty unanimous around here 

What was the cause behind that? Was it because Kareem peaked in a weak era? Was it because of his playstyle that wasn't very flashy (other than the skyhook)?

Voting always is, should and will be subjective, objective, and biased depending on the voter. There may be guidelines for voting but there cant be criteria. What are the criteria when voting for US President? You can't be serious and tell me that the last 4 presidents all checked the same boxes. What are the criteria when voting for Miss Universe or Eurosong or anything else that we vote on? Voting is not grading.

358,Would the 2018 Rockets offense still be as effective today?,11te6gk,"As most of us would know, the Houston Rockets were a dominant force in 2018 that were plagued by unfortunate injuries, and their simple yet effective offense of running isolations and pick and rolls for Harden and CP3 in a pure 5-out system played a huge part in their basketball dominance. 

However, I'm curious as to whether or not it would work today? Most teams in the league have incorporated heavy off-ball movement and screening into their offensive systems. While the 2018 Rockets were not bereft of any off-ball movement whatsoever, their 5-out system was enough to give Harden and CP3 the space they needed to operate in. 

Would this offensive system work today? If so, is it not being employed by more teams because of a lack of personnel?",Izrezar,42,15,0.74
359,Will Domantas Sabonis make an All-NBA team this year?,11te60a,"I've always felt that Sabonis has been a bit underrated for a while. But with the Kings playing so well, and with the numbers Sabonis is posting up, I think he has a great shot of making all-NBA. 

Embiid and Jokic have the first and second team Center spots locked up (In no particular order), so that just leaves one spot open for the third team. Sabonis' biggest competition for this spot would be Bam Adebayo, and while Bam is a better defender, All-NBA focuses more on offense, where Sabonis is superior. 

He's posting up 19/12/7, and is essentially a triple double threat as a Center/Forward hybrid. Moreover, he has been hyper efficient this season, shooting over 60% of the field with an impressive 67% TS. 

So with all of this being said, do you think Sabonis makes All-NBA this year? And as a bonus question, do you think he's a top 3 center in the NBA, surpassing KAT?",Varolyn,104,186,0.96

367,"If Denver continues to struggle defensively and Kings lose their 3&D man Kevin Heurter, doesn't that make 7-10 seed more desirable?",11td3w4,"Denver recently struggled from defense and lost to tanking/play in teams 4 games straight. Their bench has been horrific and trades that they made(Bones, Thomas Bryant) were meaningless. Even though Jokic scores 35 points in 80% shooting, team somehow manages to lost based on their horrible defense from MPJ and Murray and turnovers. If their 3 point shooting goes cold in the playoffs, they have no way but put jokic for 45 minutes in a game

Kings are a legitimate contender I must admit, but losing Kevin can be huge. He has been their reliable 3 point shooter and losing him can be huge on offensive end. Also, I am not sure if they can keep up their hot streak from 3 point line and Fox actually performing in the playoffs.

Thats the 1st and 2nd seed in the west. For 3rd to 6th seed, except for the grizzlies who are mentally out of the control, all of them are legitimate title contenders like clippers, suns(not w/o KD), warriors.

Maybe for the west, getting play in spot might better than facing 3rd to 6th seed in the first round",junahn,44,0,0.19

You also have Alex Poythress, Archie Goodwin, Willie Cauley-Stein, and Nerlens Noel that could round out the 15 man roster. 

Now I know it's not just as easy as adding up their win shares, but if you do so, that team ends up with around 23 wins.  While certainly not great, that's still more wins than the Bobcats or Magic ended up with that season. Plus if you look at those same players win shares for the following season (not even including any players they would have picked up in the draft), they are probably a playoff team. 

*Technically Enes never played at Kentucky because he was ruled ineligible due to payments he received as a pro player in Europe, but I'm including him here anyway because he was a Calipari recruit that signed with Kentucky and IMO still counts in this made-up hypothetical scenario.",RecordReviewer,12,0,0.3

409,"Teams without their stars: Bucks, 76er, Warriors perform; Nuggets, Mavericks flail",11sy61v,"I was curious how teams perform with and without their star players.

&#x200B;

|Team / Player|Win % with Star|Win % Without Star|Star Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bucks / Giannis|.759 (41-13)|.600 (9-6)|\+.159|
|Celtics / Tatum|.708 (46-19)|.400 (2-3)|\+.308|
|Nuggets / Jokic|.705 (43-18)|.375 (3-5)|\+.330|
|76ers / Embiid|.673 (37-18)|.692 (9-4)|\-.019|
|Mavericks / Doncic|.544 (31-26)|.308 (4-9)|\+.236|
|Warriors / Curry|.500 (22-22)|.538 (14-12)|\-.038|

Some things jumped out at me:

* It's remarkable how many games star players miss in this era. Kudos to Tatum.
* Denver and Mavs need to figure out their teams around Jokic and Doncic. Those are the stars with the most assists per game, so they may be more important to their teammates as playmakers.
* Warriors have been better without Curry than I expected. Similarly, I think of Celtics as a rounded team, but the small sample without Tatum has been surprisingly unsuccessful.
* Kyrie is the best thing to happen to the 76ers in years.",POrg,82,2,0.52
410,"If KD had never joined the Warriors, does Steph average his 2016 season numbers for 6-7 seasons in a row?",11sxwph,"Steph this season is putting up the same raw stats as he did his 2016 MVP campaign.

We don’t really get to see the 2016 version of Steph again until the 2019 playoffs and in subsequent seasons.

Since 2016 his stats by season without KD have been: 

2016: 30ppg, 5rpg, 7apg on 67%TS and 11 3PTA per game

2021: 32ppg, 5rpg, 6apg on 66%TS and 13 3PTA per game

2022: 26ppg, 5rpg, 6apg on 60%TS and 12 3PTA per game

2023: 30ppg, 6rpg, 6apg, on 67%TS and 11 3PTA per game

2016-2023 is 8 Seasons and he’s put up similar production in all the seasons without KD except last season, in which he dominated on the way to a ring anyway.

So my question is, do you think it would’ve been possible to see this version of Steph for all those seasons if KD never joined? If so, do you think Steph would’ve gotten more respect from the public and media versus what he gets now? He’s a universal top 10 to 15 player already but it’s kind of wild to me to think about what it would’ve looked like if Durant never did join Golden State.",DrunkPirateHunter,21,0,0.34

TBD (Changed teams at the deadline, which messed with W/L %): Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant

# How did the models fare for the 2023 All-Star game?

In case you were wondering how the models did for the All-Star game, I had run the models on February 4. Of the 31 players with at least a 0.5 probability, 3 did not play enough games (AD, Harden, Booker) and predictably missed, 3 were predicted to make it but did not (Jimmy Butler, Trae Young, Darius Garland), and the other 25 made it. With 27 total All-Star selections, the unlikely All-Stars were Jrue Holiday and Jaren Jackson Jr.

# Notes

1. This is a model to predict likelihood (either they make it or they don't), and the order was constructed based on their likelihood. Therefore, ordering the players like so may be a fundamentally flawed concept, but it's still interesting to see what results come out.

2. By ""simple"" and ""widely available,"" the statistics used are pace-adjusted PPG, RPG, APG, Steals + Blocks per game (SBPG), relative true shooting (rTS), WS/48, and team W/L %. I know WS/48 is oft-maligned for various reasons and there may be some autocorrelation happening as a result, but it seems to provide some extra dimension of information and avoids the use of WS, BPM, VORP, etc.

3. I was the one making the teams work positionally, so if you have any complaints about the positional placements of players, blame me, not the machine.

4. Embiid, Jokic, and Giannis were a strong top 3 with little separation. It's worth noting that this is not a model made to predict the MVP so I wasn't trying to differentiate between them. Embiid and Jokic are effectively interchangeable for the purposes of making the teams.

5. Jaren Jackson Jr. has a probability of 0.289, and it was around here (0.287) for All-Star voting as well. Seems like the model doesn't have enough info to evaluate his 4.1 stocks per game, or possibly, high steals/blocks counts have more frequently belonged to big men who otherwise weren't good enough to make the All-Star/All-NBA game (see: early Gobert, Whiteside, Drummond, Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, etc.).

6. In descending order of probability (0.75+): Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, James Harden, Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Donovan Mitchell, Stephen Curry, Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler, De'Aaron Fox, Domantas Sabonis, Julius Randle, Pascal Siakam

7. After them (0.60-0.72): Trae Young, Darius Garland, Paul George, Jrue Holiday, Lauri Markkanen, Jalen Brunson, Anthony Edwards, DeMar DeRozan, Kristaps Porzingis, Tyrese Haliburton, Bam Adebayo.

8. The model predicts **either** All-Star **or** All-NBA appearances, so the 60% or higher being 7 out of 11 (63.6%) All-Stars seems to line up. None of them figure to be solidly in the All-NBA conversation.

9. Fox has been one of the strongest climbers over the last month, so with Ja missing games due to suspension, Fox may pass him and/or Dame. There is still a significant gap to be crossed though, so he's more likely to make it if Ja misses so many games it dents his resume.

431,Did the big 3 Miami Heat underachieve and are they overrated?,11so04z,"Over the past few weeks I’ve seen people constantly say they underachieved, To me no they didn’t. Some people think they should’ve went 4/4 some think 3/4 but it’s hard to win 1 ring let alone back 2 back. Obviously they should’ve won in 2011 but we know how that went but 4 finals in 4 years with 2 rings, 27 game winning streak(3rd all time) and a 66-16 win record(franchise record). That’s not underachieving(unless you genuinely thought they were gonna win 8 rings😂😂😂)

Are they overrated?
It seems they get overrated simply bc of lebron and the he only wins with stacked teams thing. Once 2013 hit you can tell both Dwade and bosh were starting to regress due to injury and dwades knees having constant fluid in them. The team was good don’t get me wrong but outside the big 3 the team was mid asf. The 4th best player was Mario chalmers in 2012. In 2013 the 4th option was 37 year old ray Allen(maybe Mario again). 2014 same thing. In the playoffs it was contagiously lebron only performing in the last 2 years. I feel like I’m gonna get flack for this but Dwade and bosh were horrendous in each pacers series and even with lebron masterclass performances the team would still lose cause Dwade is shooting 3-16 or bosh is shooting 1-8 yes injuries but it just seems weird how they would be hot garbage come the ecf/finals in 2013/2014
In game 6 of the 2012 ecf where lebron had the greatest game of his career. Dwade shot 6-17 
bosh shot 3-8
Now Imagine if lebron didn’t flip that switch.

A combination of Jokic having a couple of bad defensive games, and Jamal Murray doing his best Russell Westbrook impersonation the Nuggets haven't managed a win in the last week.

Murray is averaging 16.3 points(on 18.3 attempts per game) and 5.5 assists on an abysmal 41.5%(almost 20% below league average) true shooting over this stretch.  Will Murray be able to turn it around to help Jokic fight off the Sixers and Bucks fans onslaught?

Regardless, how would you tally his career? From his high-flying post-AI days in Philly to winning a Finals MVP with the Dubs, Iguodala was a ONE-time all star achieving everything that a franchise player could ever dream of. His early flash, later evolution, two-way skillset and leadership needs no introduction, and dare I say he reminds me of Kobe.

The locks on All-NBA guards are Luka, Dame, Mitchell, and Harden. Then, for the last two spots, you have SGA (incredible, but bad team), Haliburton (slightly less incredible, bad team), Brunson (great, but is he really better than these guys??), Booker (is the best SG in the league but missed a bunch of time), Kyrie (…), and Fox — who has comparable stats, while also being the most clutch player in the NBA on one of the best teams in the league. Like, winning counts to me, and I can’t say that anyone else in that tier has contributed to more winning.

Let me know if I’ve forgotten about a contender here, but to me it feels like SGA and Fox are the third team guards right now. Do people agree? Does anyone else think this hard about All-NBA third team guards??",bta47,62,60,0.81

Although plenty of Redditors, members of the media, and fans have argued about Embiid/Jokic/Giannis and the MVP award for three years now, betting markets have been incredibly reluctant to pick Joel Embiid as the favorite to win MVP. Jokic survived losing to the Sixers earlier in the season to become the heavy favorite for months, and even survived recent losses amidst unparalleled success from Embiid. Until tonight. For the first time all season (and probably since midway through last season) Joel Embiid is the betting favorite to win MVP.

465,Postseason Reformatting,11shlvb,"For some reason, it bothers me how the NBA playoffs are divided geographically. Look at the NFL and MLB and you could have a New York-Boston Final, or an all Los Angeles Final, if they are good enough to make it. That’s probably because those 2 leagues were themselves merged from other leagues and the championship is AFC (former AFL) and NFC (older NFL); the World Series used to literally be 2 leagues fighting it out. 

For the NBA (and NHL, as the scheduling is similar), the regular season formula is fine: travel is hard, and you should play more games against your division to limit it.

However, for the playoffs, they should seed teams 1-16, irregardless of conference, and have a 4-round bracket that leads to the Finals. Maybe the 2 best teams are in the same conference and they should meet in the last round, not in earlier rounds simply because they are East or West.

Idk. It’s probably never going to happen but it just bothers me",Local_Stay4957,7,0,0.43

The Lakers absolutely HAD to win tonight, there was simply no other option if they truly wanted to make a run to the playoffs. Whether you want to blame the incompetent medical staff for such a ridiculous decision, or Jeanie for refusing to sign a 10 day big man for money reasons despite having no available centers (they knew this weeks in advance), one thing is certain and that is that the Lakers front office is still arguably the worst in the league. Rob did an excellent job at the deadline, but one good deed doesn’t take away from the things you did to put yourself in that hole, nor does it take away from decisions that dig you back into it later.",william4534,129,192,0.72

482,The Most Consistently Productive Stat Sheet Stuffers (Game Score),11sdmb1,"Game score is a player evaluation metric which can be considered John Hollinger's simple and linear version of the Player Efficiency Rating. Game Score does not make any adjustments like PER does for team pace.

An ""average"" Game Score is considered 10, while 40 is considered a fantastic Game Score.

Listed here are the 42 most consistent players at producing a game Score at 10 or higher. 42 players was used because of the cutoff at 80% of games doing so.

How to read:

Player: X/Y (percentage)

X = the number of games that the player has produced a Game Score of at least 10. Y = the total number of games the player has played. I have done some manual work and subtracted games where players did not produce a high Game Score and played under 20 minutes, because this is an accumulation statistic (all-in-one box score) and in games where players were injured it did not feel fair to penalize their percentage. However we are counting games under 20 minutes where they produced a Game Score of at least 10 because that means they were efficient in a short time and it feels like this should be rewarded for this list.

The list is ordered by players who most frequently posted a Game Score of 10 or higher relative to the number of games they played.

488,Bucks without Giannis: 9-6. 76ers without Embiid: 9-4,11sc11m,"It is worth noting 11-6 for Giannis may be more appropriate since he left 2 games early.

76ers are also 5-2 with Harden but no Embiid. They've beat much better teams as well. They beat the Kings without Harden and Embiid and beat the Nets with both Kyrie and Harden.

The only .500+ quality team the Bucks have beat without Giannis is the Heat when he left early. They technically beat two other teams above .500 (Suns and Nets). However, the Nets played their entire bench that game and the Suns have a losing record post KD trade in games he doesn't play (which that was one of them).

Bucks win percentage without Giannis is 65% (using 11-6). With him it is 76%.

76ers are at 69% without Embiid. They are at 67% with him.

Point is: The entire narrative that Giannis somehow has so much more help and that his team is still so good without him just seems wrong. Don't get me wrong, the Bucks supporting cast is great and they complement Giannis extremely well but without him they aren't as equipped to win as the 76ers. Harden can run the offense much better than anyone on the Bucks and the 76ers have much better options in terms of guys that can create shots for themselves and others. If Middleton was his normal 33 MPG 20+ PPG self it might be a different discussion but for this season it seems very clear the 76ers have been clearly better without their star than the Bucks. Which is not what the narrative is.

Both teams can certainly lose in the first round but let's say they both survive. They're 2-2 on the year, though the two Sacramento wins came without Bane in one and without Ja in the other.

First, some basic assumptions - let's say that Ja is available for all games, that Adams is questionable and probably not 100% if he does play, and Clarke is obviously out for the season. On the Kings side, everyone is available. Grizzlies are the current 2 seed so let's say they have home court advantage.

I think this is a fascinating offense vs. defense series, where the Grizzlies are clearly the tougher team with a much better defense thanks to JJJ, but struggle to make shots consistently, especially at the end of games.

499,Who are your Top 10 Players in the league right now not based solely off this season.,11s8rxf,"Obviously there are going to be players that are performing inform this season compared to other great players who might be injured or not doing anything.

 1. Giannis

Undeniably the most dominant player on both ends. Champion. 50 point close out.

2. Steph Curry

Greatest shooter, still in a sort of prime coming fresh off a FMVP. 

3. Kevin Durant

Again, Proven top 3 talent for decades and he looks even better now and might secure a FMVP this post-season

4. Embiid

Embiid is the most skilled bigman we've ever seen, he got a kobe/mj esque midrange and is a 3 level threat while being a good playmaker and facilitator while being a DPOY level player. Has yet to prove himself as HIM in the playoffs like the 3 above him

5.Luka

Controversial but what he has done in the post-season negates his defence and regular-season records. he's obviously a top 5 talent in the league and i think he just edges out the 6th best in the league which is obviously

6.Jokic

Regular season monster, Efficient everywhere albeit at a small clip probably the greatest passing big man we've seen and one of the greatest playmakers we've seen. I think he's great and i know people are gonna be like wow hes so low for being a mvp front-runner but like Embiid he just hasn't been HIM in the postseason and he just isn't as dominant offensively and defensively to make up for it.

7.:LBJ

Should be higher but his failure as a laker for the past 3 seasons and the fact the he does look a step slower than the top KD and Steph makes me think that Prme LBJ would definitely carry these Lakers teams to atleast the 2nd Round and he hasn't. Statistically he's been great and its amazing that he's still even top 10 at this point in his carrer

8.Harden

Harden in my opinion is the best playmaker currently in the league he's having his best 3pt season he is still carving up defences and has proven himself time after time as a capable defender

9. Kawhi

he doesn't play would easily be top 3 but he doesn't play.

Similary to Kawhi this dude just doesn't player, hasn't been able to do anything with LBJ since the bubble and he's never availble, a return to form seems imminent  and he might shoot up to top 5 after this season",xiumn,69,0,0.37
500,Did Shaq single handedly tank the Lakers chance of 4-peating in 2003?,11s81xx,"As much flack that Shaq gets about being lazy/out of shape, the ""I got hurt on company time, I'll heal on company time"" thing doesn't get brought up too often today as one of the biggest diva moves that hurt a team. Don't get me wrong this was talked about all the time when it happened and Shaq was rightfully criticized but you would think haters of his would bring this up all the time

So basically what had happened was that in the 2002 offseason Shaq needed surgery for an arthritic toe, but decided not to do it and wait right before training camp because he didn't want to mess his summer up. This directly led to the Lakers going 11-19 in the first 30 games, which meant LA had to play 100% in long stretches to finish 5th in the conference. The problem with that was when they got to the playoffs the players were totally exhausted, especially by the time they faced San Antonio in the West. And I'm not taking anything away from the 03 Spurs, definitely an overlooked team that doesn't get talked about as one of the best defensive lineups ever. However as a result of the grueling work load from the regular season and playing 14 playoff series in a row, Kobe was playing through injuries, Rick Fox was out, Horry missed every single 3 he took in the conference semi finals and went 2/20 the previous round, and even Shaq got outplayed by Duncan. Maybe it's just all speculation that Shaq's actions led to all of this but I gotta imagine that they beat the Spurs and go on to win the title if Shaq gets the treatment, the series went to 6 with all that happening

I understand that Shaq 3 peated and maybe deserved to relax, ""only three-peating"" is pretty dumb to complain about. And I also don't buy the idea that Shaq's laziness/fitness robbed him of his potential because he got fit again in Miami/Phoenix while still being a top 5 center until he turned 38, it was his free throws.  Shaq with a Kobe work ethic IMO isn't viable considering he was 7'1 and over 300 pounds even when fit, he dealt with foot injuries all the time. But in the end this is a totally selfish move that killed their chance at a championship and the first modern 4-peat right? Everyone on the team suffered because Shaq just wanted a longer vacation",lowercase-punishment,41,25,0.64

His presence is significant enough to leave a vacancy in the vibe.

He isn’t a magnet in the space like Stephen Curry, whose cubicle is teeming with boxes of shoes and swag. Wiggins doesn’t set the tone like Draymond Green and his booming voice, or lighten the mood like Andre Iguodala’s random discussions. But it’s noticeable Wiggins is not there laughing with Jordan Poole or talking across the room’s diameter to JaMychal Green. Wiggins’ smile is usually a symbol that things are well. But it’s been gone for a while.

They know why, inside that locker room. He has their grace. That says a lot.

509,NBA's full statement on the Ja Morant suspension,11s6qrr,"> NEW YORK, March 15, 2023 - The NBA announced today that Memphis Grizzlies guard Ja Morant has been suspended eight games without pay for conduct detrimental to the league. The discipline is in response to Morant's live streaming of a video on March 4 in which he is holding a firearm in an intoxicated state while visiting a Denver area nightclub. Morant will be eligible to return for the team's game against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday, March 20.

> A meeting took place today in the NBA's New York offices between NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and Morant to discuss Morant's conduct. NBA Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars and NBPA Executive Director Tamika Tremaglio, among others, attended the meeting.

> The league office conducted an investigation of the March 4 incident. Based on the information obtained during the investigation, the league did not conclude that the gun at issue belonged to Morant, was brought by him into the nightclub or was displayed by him beyond a brief period.
The investigation also did not find that Morant possessed the gun while traveling with the team or in any NBA facility, and the Colorado authorities did not find sufficient cause to charge Morant with a crime.

> ""Ja's conduct was irresponsible, reckless and potentially very dangerous,"" said Silver. ""It also has serious consequences given his enormous following and influence, particularly among young fans who look up to him. He has expressed sincere contrition and remorse for his behavior. Ja has also made it clear to me that he has learned from this incident and that he understands his obligations and responsibility to the Memphis Grizzlies and the broader NBA community extend well beyond his play on the court.""

510,"Between March 25th and April 2nd, the MVP candidates will all face each other. Will this one week decide the MVP race?",11s6ofa,"Giannis will face Jokic on the 25th and Embiid on the 2nd. Giannis has not yet faced Jokic this season, and has a record of 1-2 versus Embiid. Against the 76ers he has averaged 27/13/5/1/2 with 4 turnovers on 53%TS. 

Jokic will face Giannis on the 25th and Embiid on the 27th. Jokic has not yet faced Giannis this season, and has a record of 0-1 versus Embiid. In one game against the 76ers he put up a line of 24/8/9/0/2 with 7 turnovers on 82%TS. 

Embiid will face Jokic on the 27th and Giannis on the 2nd. Embiid has faced both this season and has a record of 3-1 against them. In these games he has averaged 31/12/7/1/2 with 4 turnovers on 55%TS.

This one week could totally decide the MVP race. With the way the media is starting to shift, I'm not sure Jokic's case can withstand getting burned by Embiid again(47/18/5/3/2 on 66%TS) let alone Giannis' potentially punishing him at the rim. Similarly, it may be hard for voters to justify Giannis if he ends this stretch with a 1-4 record agains the other candidates. I would argue the pressure might be greatest on Embiid though. Having never won an MVP, all eyes will be on him as the media shifts in his favor. The opportunity to dominate in games versus these two and build a 5-1 season record against them is too good to pass up.

Tatum has a team with great depth. 2 great bigs in Horford and Williams, an amazing number 2 in jaylen brown. Brogdon and Smart are a great pg combo. Then you got elite role players like Grant Williams and derrick white.

I understand the regular season standings is one list, but in reality who are the teams most feared?

**1a tier**

If Wiggins is back I have to say the **Warriors** are the 1a team that's a hair above the rest.

If Kd is back the **Suns** should be the number 1 team on paper, but with limited time playing together it will be hard for them to get their chemistry down while in the middle of the big fight that is the playoffs.

The **Lakers** are the most interesting to me because obviously Lebron. This team got so much better this year, with trades, and AD can take over a game defensively and down low. It will be hard to call anyone a favorite against this LA team with a healthy Lebron, from the way they have been playing since ASB.

**1b tier**

I want to put my Kings here but for the same reasons you could put the **Nuggets** here, their offense. And the Nuggets have playoff experience over the Kings. Plus the better record helps break the tie.

**Grizzlies** are a tough team to play, in any situation on any given day. They are not a team anyone wants to get down and dirty with in the playoffs an if/when Ja comes back, they will be even tougher.

My **Kings** can surprise any team in the league. We are finally getting the respect we deserve and its been a long time coming. We have the number one offense and more importantly, we have a closer. We all know that in the playoffs, you need a ""Kobe"" type of player who can iso their way to a bucket in any scenario.

**1c tier**

Clippers/Mavs I dont know what to say about them. I haven't watched enough **Clippers** to tell what kind of Kawhi/PG13 dup there will be. I want to put the clippers a lot higher but maybe someone can chime in on them for me. Kawhi has Finals experience and is a great two way player to count out.

The **Mavs** have two of the best offensive ball handlers in the league, definitely the best guard duo in the game. But what's beyond that? Do we need 40 point Kyrie and Luka every game in the playoffs? Again the star power here makes me at first want to rank them higher, but a team with 2 elite guards and nothing else has never been successful in the playoffs. You need bigs and defense when the game slows down.

The best of these 12 is Brook Lopez at 107.1 and the worst is Domantas Sabonis at 116.1.

For those who aren’t sure how the stat works, defensive rating is how much your team gives up on the other end while you are on the floor, per 100 possessions. A higher defensive rating is worse.

Defensive rating isn’t necessarily a good individual stat. However, in my opinion, centers have a larger impact on the defensive rating than any other positions. If you have a good defensive center, most likely you’ll have a solid to good defense. If you have a bad defensive center, most likely you’ll have a bad defense.

For reference on these numbers, the Grizzlies have the #1 defensive rating in the league at 109.4. The worst is the Spurs at 119.2. 15th is the Knicks, who are at 113.4.",xpillindaass,34,2,0.54

545,Brook Lopez for All-NBA,11ryy0z,"While Embiid and Jokic will certainly take the first two All-NBA spots for Cs, I think it's about time Brook Lopez makes it and he deserves his place on the All-NBA 3rd Team.

While Jrue may have made the all-star team, Brook is imo the second most important player on the Bucks, and while not nearly on Giannis' MVP caliber level his unique contributions make him almost equally as defining for the Bucks' entire identity.

In one of the strangest career turns in NBA history, when talking about Lopez you have to start with the defensive end of the floor. The current front runner for DPOY, he is by far the key to the Bucks' defense. **While Jrue and Giannis are fantastic on that end, with those two healthy and Lopez injured they were just the 14th ranked defense last season. Now with Brook back they're in contention to be 1st on that end** despite Giannis and Jrue combining for nearly 30 missed games already. Guess who has only missed 1 game this year? Brook Lopez. We've seen what it looks like with him and without him - **he is the centerpiece on this end**, and might be the best defender at the league's most important defensive position.

Offensively his contributions have been nothing short of stellar as well. His raw numbers are solid, but they really don't come close to telling the whole story. While Giannis is the driving force of the Bucks' offense, **their entire scheme - the 5-out offense to give Giannis a ton of space - is based upon one thing: Lopez's ability to stretch the floor.** Giannis is the driving force, but without a C who can shoot it like Lopez can, there is no 5-out offense in the first place. He's also shown to be more than capable of ramping up his offensive volume when needed averaging over 21ppg over his last 12 games.

**Having played 68/69 games for the Bucks so far, being the centerpiece of their defense nearly singlehandedly vaulting them from average to elite on that end, and being the 5-out for a superstar that really needs to play in a 5-out offense, Brook Lopez is clearly the second most valuable player on the best team in the NBA.** He's been more valuable on both ends of the floor than Bam making his only competition Sabonis. Given the massive gap on defense(Sacramento is 26th on that end for reference), I think that's more than enough to make up for Sabonis' advantages as a passer.",RealPrinceJay,52,3,0.52

It's not a particularly strong crop of college players this year, and you may know the top names. However, for this post, we're going to look past the lottery picks and flag some players who may be undervalued based on their current ranking (on ESPN's draft page.)

---

**SF Dariq Whitehead, Duke, # 28 prospect on ESPN**

Dariq Whitehead is following a similar career arc to current rookie, A.J. Griffin. They were both top 10 recruits who enrolled at Duke to much fanfare. Both suffered injuries and struggled out of the gates, resulting in modest numbers as freshmen. For his part, Whitehead is averaging only 8.3 points per game.

But like A.J. Griffin, you can still see flashes of an NBA starter here. Griffin was a lights out shooter at Duke and Whitehead isn't far behind -- hitting 41.1% from 3 and 88.5% from the line. Whitehead is also a more fluid athlete than Griffin and uses his length and basketball IQ to be a good defender. From what I understand, he's also a high character guy.

There's a chance Whitehead can reverse his sagging momentum with a strong tournament and make his way back into the lottery. But if not, teams should look at him as a great value in mid R1. It's not easy to find potential wing starters -- and he has all the tools you'd want to get there one day.

---

**PF Trayce Jackson-Davis, Indiana, # 31 on ESPN**

Trayce Jackson-Davis is a candidate for the Wooden Award for best college player, and comes with NBA bloodlines (as Dale Davis' son). Yet, the league doesn't care much about him. Honestly, it's hard to blame them. He's old -- 23. Yuck. He doesn't shoot threes. Barf.

Still, Jackson-Davis happens to be good at ""basketball."" He averaged 20.8 points, 10.9 rebounds, and 2.7 blocks this season. That, coupled with his size (6'9"", 245) would make him a traditional PF back in his dad Dale's day. In today's game, it would make him a likely center/""big."" But that could be a positive. You'd almost prefer to have a 6'9"" big than a plodding 7-footer these days. Jackson-Davis can give you some athleticism and genuine skill at the position. He's comfortable with the ball in his hands -- illustrated by his 4.1 assists per game. He may end up being an NBA player in the mold of a Dwight Powell. That may not sound like any great shakes, but that's a value in R2.

**SF Keyontae Johnson, Kansas State, # 38 on ESPN**

Once again, ""age"" is one factor that's pushing down our next pick Keyontae Johnson. Johnson is 22 and suffered a scary injury back at Florida. Team doctors will have to check him carefully before signing off on him as a draft pick.

But if they *do*, this kid could be a real steal at his draft position. He's 6'6"", 230, and built like a grown ass [man](https://kansasstate.rivals.com/news/kso-nuggets-keyontae-johnson-arrives-in-manhattan?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGvyPu4GvCsaRrPzI4F69dfgAJSj8P31eTJ-k_iLAvUBqHQBCjv7BJZ1o39TJ9VEkgNoBOXJq_ygW5wvMq7Easihv5fzq7KTJvVFS02i2ImhGg6FGcUfuV_5gq84UOTM2q5KMRpyJ5uFQ4Wmyco5bJNSSyvAtldJzedqKFW4b4Vd). He has all-around skill, averaging 17.7 points, 7.0 rebounds, and hitting 41.9% from 3. My friend said it best when he remarked: ""Keyontae Johnson is who Jae Crowder *thinks* he is."" If he can have a better or even similar career, he'd be a great bargain on the second day.

**SG Terrence Shannon, Illinois, # 43 on ESPN**

We're sticking with the oldies with Terrence Shannon, a 22-year-old wing who has also been around college for 4+ years and played for multiple different schools.

Still, Shannon has the skill set that NBA teams want as a potential 3+D wing. The ""D"" is further along right now, as he uses his sturdy 6'6"" 210 size well to guard multiple positions. He's only shooting 32.7% from 3 this season, but he's shot better in the past and may get back into serviceable range. I'd comp him to someone like Josh Richardson -- again, not an exciting player, but one who's had a long NBA career.

**SG Amari Bailey, UCLA, # 73 on ESPN**

We're flipping down to the freshman here with Amari Bailey, a top 20 recruit who hasn't done a ton at UCLA so far. He's only averaging 10.6 points and 2.0 assists per game. Offensively, it's hard to see him thriving. He's not a great shooter (35% from 3, 68% from the line) and not a dynamic point guard. 

Still, there's a role for an Amari Bailey type at the next level. He's a big, athletic guard who can potentially hound opposing PGs and play off the ball on offense -- similar to the role that Alex Caruso or prime Avery Bradley serve. Given his age, Bailey would also have more upside from there if a team can develop his skill set. UCLA had an injury to veteran Jaylin Clark, so Bailey will have an extended opportunity to improve his stock this month.",ZandrickEllison,6,45,0.89

556,Value of assists,11rvj04,"I’ve noticed a weird double standard in the MVP race. 

Jokic is averaging 24.7 PTS 10 AST

Embiid is averaging 33.4 PTS 4.1 AST

I see a lot of people basically disregard the 8.7 point difference between the two because Jokic has 5.9 more assists and therefore the offensive output is the same if not higher for Jokic

Now let’s compare two different players 

SGA is averaging 31.3 PTS and 5.6 AST

Harden is averaging 21.8 PTS and 10.8 AST

Here the point difference is 9.5 and the assist difference is 5.2.

The overall narrative is the SGA is having an all time season and is a top 5 MVP candidate, 1st team NBA.

Harden on the other hand didn’t make the all-star game. 

I think points have always been more important as an overall stat and should be held more valuable as an offensive comparison. In addition efficiency is  amazing for both Jokic (70TS) and Embiid (64TS).

**LA** **Clippers**

* Blew a 3-1 lead to the Nuggets in the Bubble

**Warriors**

* Draymond punching Poole

**Nets**

* Swept in the First Round against Boston

------------------------------------------

Just think of all the legendary nicknames from players of that era.

Kobe - Black Mamba

Tim Duncan - The Big Fundamental

Shaq - he has a bunch so take your pick

AI - The Answer

Paul Pierce - The Truth

KG - The Big Ticket

Ray Allen - Jesus Shuttlesworth

Andrei Kirilenko - AK47

Amar'e - STAT

Shawn Marion - The Matrix

Corey Magette - Bad Porn

Yao Ming - the Great Wall

Vince Carter - Vinsanity, Half Man Half Amazing

Jason Williams - White Chocolate

Robert Horry - Big Shot Bob

Brian Scalabrine - White Mamba

Matt Bonner - Red Rocket

Richard Hamilton - Rip

Jamal Crawford - J Crossover

Josh Smith - J Smoove

Dwight Howard - Superman

Dwyane Wade - Flash

Chris Paul - The Point God

Lebron James - King James

Darko Milicic - The Human Victory Cigar

Steve Francis - the Franchise

Gilbert Arena - Agent 0

Rafer Alston - Skip 2 My Lou

And Im sure I forgot a few more

------------------------------------------

How many players in the league today have nicknames on that level?

Aside from Lebron and CP3, the only ones I can think of are 

Kawhi - The Klaw

KD - Slim Reaper

Embiid - The Process

Harden - the Beard

Dillion Brooks - Evil Danny Green

Steph Curry - Skyfucker

Giannis - the Greek Freak

Lopez - Splash Mountain

Lauri - The Finnisher

Robert Williams - Timelord

And thats about it.

595,Jeremy Sochan vs Paolo Banchero,11rjld5,"Shout out to both these talented young front court rookies tonight. 

Particularly to sochan who probably isn't as well known to the general public as the soon to be (deserved) rookie of the year

Paolo: 27 points 11-21 6 rebounds 0 assists 2 blocks 0 steals  in 32 minutes 

Sochan: 29 points 11-19 11 rebounds 2 assists 0 blocks 1 steal  in 32 minutes

On top of the great individual stellar play Paulo as he often has been all year initiated so much offense for Orlando, and even commanded double teams at times. He's such a skilled finisher so early in his career in that pull-up mid-range jumper is money

Jeremy ran point guard for large stretches for San Antonio as he has for much of the year and for the most part looked really sharp. He also defended everyone from coe Anthony, to Wendell Carter, to fultz, to Paolo himself. He was really the only player that seems to have any effect on Paolo who ate San Antonio alive in the first quarter.

This wasn't even a sensational game from Paolo's standard which is scary

And Jeremy is probably not only the most improved rookie from the start of the year till now, but maybe the most improved player, in season, in the league. 

Both of these guys are going to be monsters in my opinion.",paxusromanus811,22,85,0.88

601,James Harden is ranked 4th on the MVP Award tracker for Basketball Reference.,11rjdg5,"Despite not making the 2023 all star team this year James Harden currently has the 4th best odds for MVP.

He’s averaging 21.8 points on 62.3% true shooting, which is one of his most efficient seasons ever, along with almost 40% from 3 (39.8%). On top of all this he’s leading the league in assists with 10.8 assists and currently has the 76ers at the 3rd seed with the 76ers being 33-11 since his return from injury.

I feel like a lot of this impact is going unnoticed due to the MVP debate between Embiid, Jokic and Giannis. A lot of the fans want to give a ton of credit to Embiid for what the 76ers are doing right now, as they should since he’s the best player on the team but Harden is starting to become very underrated.

8 - **31/36** Bulls

9 - **32/36** Washington (10th in play-in)

10 - **33/36** Jazz/Raptors (tied; Raptors are in the play-in as the 9th seed)

Currently the 4,5, & 6 seeds are Phoenix, Golden State, and the Clippers. With the playoff success the stars on these teams have enjoyed, I think it’s fair to say this group is more likely to take the West this season than the Kings/Grizz, and arguably even the Nuggets.. 

I’m curious, might these teams along with the other sleepers like the Lakers do everything they can to land the 6/7 seeds, or do they just go all out and let the cards fall where they may?

Also, would you take Nuggets/Kings/grizz vs the rest of the field? I think I’d take the field out West?",Farmer_Scrooge,77,27,0.75

636,"I traced the rise of the three point shot. It's mostly a slow and steady rise except from 2014-2020, when the league average rose from seven successful threes in 2014-15 to twelve in 2019-20. That was a crazy six years! And the Warriors led the way, with five Finals appearances and three rings.",11rczdm,"In 1979-80, the three point shot was introduced into the NBA. Interestingly, this was three years after the merger with the ABA. It took the NBA that long to accept an ABA innovation. But at first players very rarely tried it, with an average of less than one successful three point shot per game across the league.

Seven years later, in 1986-87, the league finally averaged more than one successful three point shot per game. This was one year after the NBA added the three point contest to All Star Weekend. The three point shot, led by the success of Larry Bird, was beginning to become a thing. But it was still rare.

A mere two years later, in 1988-89, the league averaged more than two successful three point shots per game. Coaches had begun to insert three point specialists in the corner for outlet passes. Usually they just stood there in the half court offense while the star did his thing and maybe passed them the ball. But as yet they were a minor irritant.

It took another four years, until 1992-93, for the league to average three successful three point shots per game. 

And then the league got impatient. In 1994 the three point line was shortened and suddenly the league jumped to over five successful threes per game. That lasted three years, but dropped back down to over four successful threes per game after the experiment ended in 1997. It's unclear when the league would have hit four per game absent the experiment. Sometime between three and six years after it hit three.

Not until 2001-02 did the league again hit five threes per game.

It took another six years, until 2006-07, before the league hit six threes per game.

It took another seven years, until 2012-13, before the league hit seven threes per game.

It took only three years, until 2015-16, for the league to hit eight threes per game.

Between 2014-15 and 2019-20, there was a rapid explosion of threes, never seen before except when the league shortened the line. The league went from over seven threes per game in 2014-15, to over eight in 2015-2016, to over nine in 2016-17, to over ten in 2017-18, to over eleven in 2018-19, and finally to over twelve in 2019-20. Wow!

Interestingly, despite the continued rise in offense the last three years, the number of successful threes has leveled off at somewhere between twelve and thirteen. The extra points are now coming inside the three point line. 

Have we reached a permanent three point plateau? I wouldn't even speculate about that until at least eight seasons have passed, since we had a seven year plateau at six successful three point shots before, only to shoot up to twice that number. 

Can you imagine teams successfully hitting eighteen threes per game? Or more? I find it hard to comprehend. And yet I can't rule it out.

0,"[OC] Last season, our ""Best Bet"" series nailed a 25:1 long shot awards pick. It may hit on a 25:1 long shot once again (fingers crossed)",11wiz1u,"In the previous offseason, we started a [**""BEST BET""**](https://decider.com/2018/09/11/rounders-at-20-most-influential-gambling-movie/) series that attempted to gauge the best values among season-long awards like MVP and Rookie of the Year. 

Those are risky, speculative picks that take a long time to pay off, but that first series worked out overall. While we only hit on 1/6 on our picks, that lone winner (Tyler Herro for Sixth Man of the Year) represented a 25:1 longshot. If you had placed $100 on each bet, you'd have walked away with a tidy $2,000 profit.

We tried our luck again this year. This time, we sprinkled the money around on different candidates in order to diversify our portfolio. Even still, we just needed 1 of them to hit again to make our money back. 

Will lightning strike twice? It just might.

We'll review each in ascending order: from our bad picks, to our close calls, to our *probable* winner.

*Note: if you're unfamiliar with the terms, a betting + number represents your profit on a $100 bet. +100 means an even money bet, +600 would mean a 6:1 chance of winning, and +6000 means 60:1.*

######**BAD PICKS**

[**MOST IMPROVED**](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/xs2o8o/oc_best_bet_series_predicting_the_most_improved/)

*preseason picks*

The ""Most Improved"" award is always confusing -- made no clearer by them naming it after George Mikan (who averaged 28.3 PPG right out of the gates as a rookie). Given that uncertainty, we divided our money on potential breakouts **Devin Vassell** (+6000), **Cam Johnson** (+5000), **Jalen Green** (+2500), and **Alperen Sengun** (+4000).

*current outlook*

We misjudged the market here. Historically, the award has gone to lesser-known players, but recent trends have veered to already-good players who took it up another level. Current favorites Lauri Makkanen and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander would follow the template set by recent winners like Julius Randle and Ja Morant. In the future, we need to adjust our strategy and go for players with a higher starting bar.

---

[**DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR**](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/xqdq25/oc_best_bet_series_predicting_the_defensive/)

*preseason picks*

We picked **Rudy Gobert** (+400) and **Ben Simmons** (+2500), figuring they would have some narrative value if they led their teams to a defensive turnaround.

*current outlook*

Sure enough, they did have some narrative value -- but unfortunately it was the wrong type of narrative. In their wake, the current landscape suggests a two-man race. Brook Lopez and Jaren Jackson Jr. are the two favorites. Notably, both Memphis and Milwaukee are in the top 3 in team defense. That's always been a key part of the criteria for the award.

---

[**SIXTH MAN of the YEAR**](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/xwbs4x/oc_best_bet_series_predicting_the_sixth_man_of/)

*preseason picks*

Historically, this award tends to go to high-scoring, jack-'em-up shooting guards. Knowing that, we went for two upside fliers who fit that bill: **Tim Hardaway Jr.** (+7000) and **Malik Monk** (+8000). Both appeared to have the potential to score 15+ PPG, which tended to be the mark you'd need to hit to contend for the award.

*current outlook*

Our logic to target scoring guards made sense, but neither Hardaway (14.2 PPG) nor Malik Monk (13.7 PPG) made enough waves nationally to garner much attention. Instead, it's become a two man race between two *other* scoring guards: Malcolm Brogdon and Immanuel Quickley. 

----

######**CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR**

[**ROOKIE OF THE YEAR**](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/xjbih4/oc_best_bet_series_projecting_the_rookie_of_the/)

*preseason picks*

After an early injury to Chet Holmgren, who knew that Paolo Banchero would be the most likely winner. So did Vegas. They listed him at +180 in the preseason, one of the biggest awards favorites. Looking for more upside, we bet on two wings in **Bennedict Mathurin** (+900) and **Jalen Williams** (+2500). Our logic was that they were polished rookies who may be more ready to hit the ground running than their one-and-done counterparts.

*current outlook*

Our two longshot picks are actually the # 2 and # 3 favorite to win at the moment, but they're miles behind Paolo Banchero. Chances are, we're going to have to settle for a runners-up trophy (which is valued at $0.) 

---

[**MVP**](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/xxzi5u/oc_best_bet_series_predicting_the_mvp/)

*preseason pick*

In the preseason, bettors tend to gravitate to a new winner and new storyline. To that end, Luka Doncic has been listed as the preseason favorite to win MVP for three years in a row. However, the idea of ""voter fatigue"" is somewhat overrated if you look at historical trends. For that reason, we eyed Nikola Jokic (+1000) and settled on **Giannis Antetokounmpo** (+700). We also thought that Antetokounmpo may be well positioned for a statistical boost given the initial absence of Khris Middleton.

*current outlook*

Our argument regarding voter fatigue appeared correct at first -- as Jokic and Antetokounmpo looked like they'd finish 1-2. However, Jokic's campaign has taken some damage lately for a variety of reasons; voter fatigue has presumably played at least a partial role in that. Time will tell whether Jokic can withstand the heat, or whether Joel Embiid will win on another buzzer beater.

---

######**OUR BEST BET**

[**COACH OF THE YEAR**](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/xm19cz/oc_best_bet_series_predicting_the_coach_of_the/)

*preseason pick*

For most entries we spread our money around, but for this we put all our hypothetical eggs in the basket of **Mike Brown** (+2500). Our logic was that the Sacramento Kings had an underrated roster and would clear their preseason over/under of 33.5. If they could push that up to 40-45 wins and sneak into the playoffs for the first time in 17 years, it'd also add an excellent narrative.

*current outlook*

Turns out, Mike Brown's turnaround of the Kings was even more pronounced than we expected and has made him a clear favorite at the moment (-250). Hopefully, he can hold on to that momentum and allow us to cash in our second 25:1 longshot. While going 1/6 on awards doesn't sound that great, hitting on that big money (+2500) means you'd have made $2,000 profit if you bet $100 on each.

Hitting on a 25:1 longshot every year isn't a sustainable goal, but hopefully we can continue to study the trends and make smarter picks in all categories in the coming years.",ZandrickEllison,9,5,0.65
1,"Ryen Russilo on Embiid's mentality when it comes to MVP: ""He does care, and you should care.

Normally this guy is getting shit on at this stage of his career and I don't think that happens from a national or neutral level."" 

Thought that since that sub has been getting bombarded with MVP posts that this was a valuable look into the psyche of Embiid and his burning desire to be the best.

It’s only been a few games, but the early returns are encouraging: the Heat are 3-1 when he has played in this stretch.

Lowry has been a boost to the Miami Heat bench unit since returning and has proven himself to be a steadying presence that sharply contrasts the sporadic play of Victor Oladipo, who he has replaced in the rotation.

He will still be the owner of one of the worst contracts in Heat franchise history, but it’s nice to see that Spoelstra is finding ways to maximize him in a limited role (and that he apparently is accepting of this new role).",lopea182,7,16,0.83
8,Why do people think Steph and KD have declined?,11whyw3,"For the past year I've been seeing people saying that these 2 have declined. Sometimes it's outright explicitly saying it and sometimes it's putting players like Giannis or Jokic over 2 guys whose peaks are top 15 all time at the very least. I just want to know why people think these 2 have declined. 

In 2021, these guys were top 3 locks according to everybody. Both had arguments for best in the world with Lebron's decline that year. Steph had his best or second best regular season that year while KD showed that while he had changed, he was still at least as good as he was in OKC/GS. KD was pretty much the consensus best player after the Bucks series that year(which I thought was undeserved because Steph and Harden both outperformed KD in the RS and didn't really get to show out in the playoffs to sway the public). Last year KD looked just as good while Steph started the season on an absolute tear. They were the leading MVP candidates and people said that they were better than ever. KD ended up missing too many games while Steph went on a months long slump after Thanksgiving that was clearly unrelated to his body declining. Steph ended up breaking out of his slump became a monster in the playoffs as usual and won a ring+FMVP. KD had a bad first round series, but that was clearly due to factors outside of his control like Ben Simmons' salary not playing and Kyrie not showing up while KD was getting swarmed by the Cs. KD has proved this season that he's still the same player though and both of these guys are putting up some of the best stats of their career, even when adjusted for pace and efficiency. Watching them, I legit don't see any difference between 2023 and 2021. 

While I can see how KD's less varied and more specialized shot selection can turn off some people, I don't get how that doesn't make him even better seeing as how his midrange jumper is wetter than ever. His defense is back to GS level despite having less help too. Additionally, even if we ignore all context in last year's playoffs, 4 games doesn't compare to the 35-50ish RS games he's played each year since 2020-21, many of which featured KD coasting due to age and recent injuries. 

On the other hand, there's absolutely no argument for Steph being any worse than he was at his peak. Statswise, he's been pretty consistent with his past seasons. Going off the eye test, he's better than he was in the early dynasty years due to his added strength and improved defense and virtually identical to 2021. Like KD, he's had random contact injuries this year, but Steph has never been the epitome of good health and his injuries haven't slowed him down one bit. 

How are these guys not the consensus #1 and #2 in the league? Do people not watch their games anymore? These guys have adapted their games like Lebron did in his second Cavs stint to become better than ever. Saying that anybody else is close to these 2 is straight up disrespectful.",NotUrAvgShitposter,20,0,0.3

12,NBA - who would you pick if you had the power to make a Super team? And why those players? You can move players to their positions.,11wgov0,"For me 

Pg - Magic Johnson - magics passing would be a show to watch on its own. His length would makes up for steph being undersized. But steph is also excellent at playing off ball and would get a crazy amount of clean looks of magic.
Sg - Steph Curry - Curry is a player who excellent at playing off the ball and moving through picks that’s his game.
Sg - Micheal Jordan - MJ is there for ISO’s and taking over the game if needed
Pf - Kareem Abdul Jabbar - Adds another unguardable dimension with the sky hook. Kareem wins chips in highschool, college, and 6 nba rings? 
C - Shaquille O’Neil - Shaq would easily be one of the best screen setters which would open crazy looks for steph and better spacing for magic to move around. Shaq had a very high ball iq and a lot forget he was a great passer! If shaq could shot freethrows that alone would make him the best of all time.

Bench 
Dennis Rodman - every successful team needs hustle player. Hustle to players who do that do well on other stats besides scoring with first class defence at any position while having the ability to get into players heads to the point their playing bad is underrated with results! 
Robert Horry - last shot? Horry or Jordan nothing more to it! 
Hakeem Ojuwan - I think I picked all the players who revolutionized the game and the last one would be Hakeem. The footwork revolutionized the sport and players up to this days come to him for advice and we’re talking the kobies, and lbjs
Lebron James - Lbj can’t be left out. He’s better than curry yes but these pieces bring better chemistry.",Reasonable-Tour4147,7,3,0.62
13,Anthony Davis since the trade deadline,11wgnef,"Without D’Angelo Russell in the lineup: 

5 games (3-2 record) 

33 PPG / 14 RPG on 21 FGA per game

With D’Angelo Russell in the lineup: 

9 games (6-3 record) 

19 PPG, 13 RPG on 15 FGA per game 

During the 2022-2023 season Anthony Davis is averaging 25.8 PPG on 17.2 FGA and 12.5 RPG in 46 games played. 

But it seems that he becomes very passive with D’Angelo Russell in the lineup. 

His PPG drops from 25.8 to 19. 

His FGA drop from 17.2 to 15. 

Is this because D’Angelo is not a true point guard, but more of a scoring guard? 

He doesn’t seem to have a good passing ability, but he shoots and scores well. 

I think he is a perfect fit next to LeBron and AD for spacing and scoring purposes, but he is detrimental to AD’s offensive game when he is the main ball handler.

If you take his stats without LeBron and D’Lo we can see why some consider him the top 10 player: 

His PPG increases up to 33 PPG and he takes 4-6 more shots per game. 

This is the Anthony Davis the Lakers need to make the playoffs. A 33 PPG monster who takes 20+ shots per game and grabs 15 rebounds. 

It’s sad to see him play like Kevon Looney so often. 

Just running around, grabbing rebounds and setting screens that don’t turn into PNR opportunities for him.",ThunderClown101,13,7,0.77
14,The Warriors road struggles are mostly related to their inability to win in clutch situations. Here is the statistical proof:,11wfokm,">Warriors offensive rating in the clutch on the road: 83.6.

That's worse than tanking teams like Spurs and Rockets, and absolutely dead last in the entire NBA. Embarrassing.

>Warriors defensive rating in the clutch on the road: 112.3.

This isn't really bad. In fact, it's in the middle of the pack.
But here's the thing, when you use both of these ORTG and DRTG ratings of the Warriors, you get this:

>The worst net rating in the clutch on the road: 

-28.6. That's three points worse than second worst team, Spurs, who have a -25.4 net rating in clutch on the road.

>Most 3 pointers attempted in the clutch: Warriors.

Threes aren't exactly the best shots to take in the clutch, especially when guys not named Curry/Klay are the ones shooting them. Everyone except Curry is shit at making  threes in the clutch on the road barring a red hot Klay.

>Third highest TOV% in the clutch on the road: 17.6%.

Only the Nuggets and Rockets turn it over more in the clutch at 18.4% and 19.2% for both respectively.

> TS% in the clutch on the road: A miserable 45.2%.

That's the absolute worst in the league, second are once again the Spurs with a 47.4% TS in the clutch on the road.

5 years apart from each other, the Houston Rockets and Miami Heat embarked on winning streaks of at least 22 games, an NBA rarity. The Boston Celtics had the unique opportunity to try to snap each streak before it reached 23. The dates of each game were March 18, 2008 and March 18, 2013, respectively. Given the odds of these events taking place on the same date, I thought I would see if there were any other strange coincidences surrounding these streaks/games.
 
The streaking teams involved are the T-Mac/Yao - ""Ming Dynasty"" Rockets and the BBW's Heat (Bron, Bosh, & Wade) (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  better known as ""The Heatles.""
Here are the links to the streaks:

***
### Streak Similarities: 
 
+ Both the Rockets and Heat won 26 of 27 games, thanks to their streaks.

+ Both the Rockets and Heat were victims of each other's streaks. [Meaning the Rockets beat the Heat during their streak, and the Heat beat the Rockets during theirs.]

+ Both the Rockets and Heat had winning streaks of exactly 4 games immediately preceding the start of their 20+ game streaks. The last 2 wins of those 4-game streaks took place on the *same dates*, 1/23 & 1/25. Both 4-game streaks ended on 1/27. By the way, the days of the week for these dates are exactly the same (i.e. 1/23 is a Monday for both years, etc.). ^**Because ^2008 ^was ^a ^leap ^year, ^and ^2013 ^was ^not, ^the ^days ^of ^the ^week ^are ^no ^longer ^synced ^after ^2/28.

+ Both the Rockets and Heat beat the Atlanta Hawks on 3/12, 6 days prior to their showdown with the Celtics, AND it was their 2nd time beating the Hawks during their respective streaks. Atlanta scored 18 points in the 1st quarter in both of the 3/12 games. 

**Now on to the 3/18 games: Celtics vs. Rockets and Celtics vs. Heat.**

***
### Game Similarities: 

+ The Celtics were on a 2 game winning streak coming in to both games.

+ Guess which referee reffed both games (1 guess):          >!Infamous NBA referee Scott Foster officiated both games (because of course he did, but you already knew that didn't you?).!<

+ The winner in each of the 3/18 games went on to win the NBA Championship later that season.

+ Boston made exactly 15 FTs and had 3 players in double figures in both games.

+ The ""No Stats All-Star,"" Shane Battier played in both games for the team that had won 22 straight. He finished with a +/- of **-15** in both games. 😂

+ Paul Pierce played for Boston in both games. 

***
### Notable Missed Similarities: ###
+ Both Ray Allen & Kevin Garnett *could* have played in both games, but each were inactive for 1 of the 2 games, but NOT the same one. 
+ Rajon Rondo *could* have played in both games, but was inactive for 1 of them.


***
### Other tidbits:
+ Coming into the Boston game, the Rockets had a differential of +272 during the streak. The Heat had a differential of +257.

+ Mike Bibby was beaten twice (2/13 & 3/12) by the Rockets playing for TWO different teams during their streak because he was traded from the Kings to the Hawks on 2/16/08. 

+ Larry Hughes took 3 L's (2/7, 2/19, 2/24) from the Rockets because he was traded from the Cavs to the Bulls on 2/21/08.
  Drew Gooden and Shannon Brown were also traded with Hughes, but were inactive in 1 or 2 of the 3 games.

+ Patrick Patterson was beaten twice (2/6 & 2/26) by the Heat because he was traded from the Rockets to the Kings on 2/20/13. Cole Aldrich  and Toney Douglas were also traded with Patterson, but were inactive in 1 of the games.



***
### Related side note: 
##The Boston Celtics played the Golden State Warriors on 12/11/15, who had won 23 straight, so they were ***1 game*** too late from being the opponent in 3 of the 4 instances in which a team was going for their 23rd straight win. Boston, AGAIN, was on a 2 game winning streak coming into that game.

29,Austin Reaves leads the Lakers vs Orlando Magic: 35 points 6 rebounds 6 assists on 9-14 shooting from the field and 16-18 FT shooting all in around 30 minutes,11w7qwm,"Saucetin Reaves shows out for the Lakeshow. He forced his way into being a Laker and he is showing why he deserves to get paid, the Lakers needed this game in a big way after the last one.

35 points 6 rebounds 6 assists and on a insanely efficient shooting night

30,"It almost seemed as if Jokic's insane stats were becoming old and boring until the Nuggets went on a 4 game losing streak. If the Nuggets recover and maintain the first seed, & Jokic goes back to dominating like he was, could the little slump have unintuitively helped Jokic's MVP chances?",11w7d6r,"It almost seemed as if Jokic's dominance was becoming stale, and we had more or less stopped talking about him. It wasn't until this 4 game slump that everyone is considering the idea that maybe Jokic isn't as good as we thought he was. Maybe he isn't invincible! He can be stopped!

But if he shuts everyone up and ends the season absolutely dominating with a 70%+ win record, the 25/12/10 he had going, do you think it might actually benefit him? Because there was no narrative for Jokic to shoot-down before, it was simply, ""He's really good and its getting boring, but Giannis is going on a 15+ game win steak, and Embiid is healthy and his numbers are becoming historic."" Giannis and Joel were becoming the talk of the town.

Now, with a new found purpose to prove himself to the critics in the closing of the season, has Jokic revived excitement about him winning MVP? Is he better off this way?",aged_monkey,61,0,0.31
31,Eric Gordon had 20 points tonight on over 100 ts%.,11w73yb,"20 points on 9 fga and 2 fta translates to a 101.21 ts%.

He shot 3-4 from 2, 4-5 from 3, and 2-2 from the line.

He played 28 minutes.

32,Westbrook with 9/12/10 and a +13 in a Clippers bounce back win in Portland,11w6yty,"Shooting was bad but he played with excellent effort, crashing the glass and creating several scoring opportunities with offensive rebounding, and setting up teammates at a very high level as usual. Typical Westbrook game tbh

How far can this Clippers team go in the playoffs?",BasedChad69420,83,405,0.89

It's his 5th career 40 point game despite being a 21 year old sophomore and is a incredibly talented tough shot maker, just needs the rest of the team to make it easier on him so he can be more consistent

47,"The Other, Other Guy: The Third ""Star"" of NBA Championship Teams",11w48r4,"PRELUDE: My method of determining the third best player on teams is absolutely terrible, but I'm sticking through- I took the third best player of each championship team by win shares and ranked them all- first of all, I don't necessarily agree with every take from win shares, and some of them CERTAINLY don't match up with popular consensus. Anyway, on to the overly pretentious opening. 

Of course, a championship team is anchored by its super star- you think of the Jordan Bulls, Magic Lakers, Lebron whatever team he's on. Sometimes, there's even a duo involved, be it Duncan and Robinson, James and Davis, or Jordan and Pippen! Then you have the third guy. The mythical big three calls to mind images of super teams, but how does EVERY championship team's third guy shape out? Do you need a star to fill the role? To explore this question, I ranked all 73 ""third"" players by win shares! To go with the regular season stat (winshares), also throwing in a few rudimentary stats from their playoff run that year! Who contributes more to winning? Another premier scorer or that rock solid glue guy?

67,The Denver Nuggets might need to trade Jamal Murray,11vz652,"BEFORE YOU RESPOND, please just read the post first because the title is not what you might assume!!!


Nikola Jokic is making the Nuggets look a lot better than they really are, and if they want to have any shot at winning the championship, they need to get some more pieces around Jokic. 


However, looking at their salary situation, that is going to be a problem. Denver is currently $35 million over the salary cap, and they may very well have the worst contract in the NBA right now with Michael Porter Jr. Right now he’s in the first year of a 5 yr/$180mil deal that he’s on until the end of the 2027 season. I say this because while he’s an elite shooter, he provides little to no value in just about every other aspect of the game. He’s an adequate rebounder, maybe, but he’s a cone on defense and provides zero playmaking ability. He’s essentially a black hole on offense and a non factor on defense, and he’ll be making $180 million through 2027. I didn't even mention him being injury prone too. Not great.


Now if we take a look at their other pieces, the players that fit well with Jokic that Denver should absolutely not look to trade (if they can avoid it) are Aaron Gordon, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Bruce Brown. They all provide defensive value, can stretch the floor, and don’t need the ball in their hands to be effective. Outside of those 3 guys, the only tradeable pieces of some value that Denver has are Jeff Green, Ish Smith, Thomas Bryant, Zeke Nnaji… not really enough to get Jokic any legitimate help.


Now Denver obviously could package either 2 or 3 of the aforementioned players (Gordon, Brown, KCP) in order to find another star to pair with Jokic, but that would gut their defense and depth even further than it already is. And since the MPJ contract is one that I don’t think any other GM would be willing to touch, and Denver can’t do anything in free agency in terms of really bringing Jokic more help, Jamal Murray seems to be the odd man out here.


Murray had a great run in the 2020 bubble, but outside of then he’s mostly just been looking like an above average starting combo guard. He can create well enough for himself off the dribble, shoot pretty well, and provides some playmaking value, which could make him an enticing option for some teams, although the $160mil contract he’s currently on isn’t exactly team friendly either. I haven’t gone through a rundown of every team to find the one(s) that would bring back the most value, or that would even accept a trade for Murray, but given Denver’s options if they want to compete for and win a championship, it seems like pretty much the only way that they can go. Do you guys agree?


TLDR: Denver is in contract hell with the shitty MPJ contract and they’re way over the cap so they can’t do anything to get Jokic more help in FA, so presumably the only way they can get Jokic more help to compete for a title w/o gutting their defense and depth is trading Jamal Murray.",C-DogDriver,70,0,0.32

Not stuff like taking Giannis first overall when that was never a possibility at the time.

Like an example for the Sixers is they drafted Mikal Bridges in the lottery and traded him on the same day and/or Fultz not having a bizarre injury as the number 1 overall pick and/or letting Jimmy walk for Tobias Harris and Al Horford (ugh).  Obviously the butterfly effect would drastically change how the team operated if any of these came to pass but the Sixers werent that far away from:

PG: Harden

SG: Fultz

SF: Butler/Bridges

Talking about Kenny Smith from Inside the NBA. While he was never a superstar level player, he put up decent numbers and would probably be a starting guard  on a lot of teams in his prime. Would constantly get above 40 percent from 3 point shooting too.  

He averaged 17.7 ppg, 7.1 ast and 2.1 rebounds in his best statistical year which was his 6th season.

He was also able to average a similar stat line his sophomore season. 

I feel like he would have had a massive contract if it was negotiated after his 4th or 6th season, just going off the consistency and potential.

Beyond the stat line he was able to co exist with a superstar player like Hakeem and was able to bring out the best in each other. Valuable trait to have for teams that built around a star.",Aktor56,18,18,0.8

But, if Wembanyama is still under contract, would his drafting team have to pay a transfer fee to Metropolitans 92? This phenomenon is not unheard of in other European sports. For example, when Cristiano Ronaldo went from Manchester United to Real Madrid, Real Madrid paid his former club 80M euros. I don't think Wembanyama would command more than a few million, but I'm sure any NBA team would pay it if given the opportunity to draft him in the NBA player.",JJWhatWhat,21,25,0.78

92,(O.C.) All the players who've been the best player on a championship going back 1969,11vrl05,"I think this is one of the true lists in this sport. It happens quite often where the guy who won MVP seems like the best player in the league, but then it's the guy who brought home the ring who really gets that praise. Giannis for instance, after the playoff exit in 2020 was getting widely slammed despite being a back to back mvp but, upon winning the ring in 2021, he became the top dog. Only 5 active players have done that. and the list of active nba players who've been the best player on a finals team but not win the ring isn't too long either. (Tatum, Booker, Jimmy Butler, and if you want you can include Dwight Howard since he's technically still playing basketball).

So let's list them I'll put the first year they did it, which should help for multiple time winners. I'll be starting from the latest.

**Any miscalculations here**

Let me explain any ""controversial"" picks I made in the making of the list here.  I am putting David Robinson as the best player on the 1999 Spurs as Duncan was still young, but I genuinely am unsure and will trust a random spurs fan on here if they say otherwise. I also have heard that Joe Dumars was up there with Isiah Thomas for those late 80s Pistons teams. and I think you can make the point for either Ben Wallace or Chauncey Billups for the 04 Pistons.

Also, I should note that I put Magic's first year as the best player on the champion lakers as 82. I wasn't sure if there was a solid argument for Kareem that year. I know for a fact Kareem was better in 1980. I am also putting Moses Malone, not Dr J as the best player on philly in 1983.

I'm not an expert on 70s basketball. I had trouble finding much about the 1979 Sonics, but Dennis Johnson seemed to have the superior accolades. I may have overrated Dave Cowens and maybe should have put havlicek in 1974 but cowens was the mvp in 1973 and John was older at that time so I made some assumptions.  Also, because I'm stopping at 1969, players who lead their teams to victory before that year(namely, Wilt and Bill Russell) will be getting credit at the first point in the timeline.

&#x200B;

Hope that all makes sense.

**The Actual List**

&#x200B;

2021: Giannis

2019 Kawhi Leonard

2017: KD

2015: Steph Curry

2012: Lebron James

2011: Dirk

2009 Kobe

2008: Kevin Garnet

2006: D-Wade

2004: Ben Wallace or Chauncey Billups

2000: Shaq

1999: Tim Duncan

1994: Hakeem

1991: Michael Jordan

1989 Isiah Thomas

1983: Moses Malone

1982: Magic Johnson

1981: Larry Bird

1979: Dennis Johnson

1978: Wes Unseld(or Elvin Hayes OR Bob Dandridge) 

1977: Bill Walton

1975: Rick Barry

1974: Dave Cowens(or Havlicek)

1972: Wilt Chamberlain(or Jerry West?) 

1971: Kareem Abdul-Jabar

1970: Willis Reed

1969: Bill Russell.

Edits: took out David Robinson for 1999 and  Joe Dumars for 1989. added in some other options for several teams in the 70s.  thanks u/[**bonziwellsayo**](https://www.reddit.com/user/bonziwellsayo/)**,** for that suggestion.   
 

&#x200B;

In total, that's about 27 unique players over a 54 year span, with the 70s having the most names with 8  unique mvps. where as the 2000s(the second highest) had 6 unique MVPS and the 80s and 90s had only 4 unique MVPS.

&#x200B;

If you cut it off at 1980, you get a pretty even average of a new best player on a finals team emerging 5 times per decade. and it's been 2 years since Giannis did it for the first time. Maybe this is a sign a new player will do it this year?

&#x200B;

of the 27 players only 6 never won an MVP award. The ones who didn't are Kawhi Leonard, whoever you pick from the 04 Pistons, Isiah Thomas, Dennis Johnson, and Rick Barry.

&#x200B;

Players who HAVE won MVP but are not, as of right now, on that list: Nikola Jokic(2020-21-2021-22), James Harden(2017-18), Russell Westbrook(2016-17) , Steve Nash (2004-05, 2005-06), Allen Iverson(2000-01)  Karl Malone(1996-97, 1998-1999) David Robinson (1994-95), Charles Barkley(1992-1993) Julius Erving(1980-81) and Bob mcadoo(1974-75). Note though that Dr. J and David Robinson did win a ring as a top 2 option on the team, unlike others on this list so i don't think they should count in the same way. 

&#x200B;

In compiling this I used [this list of previous finals MVPS](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/finals_mvp.html) and cross referenced it with a list of mvps from the same source (bball ref), and would clarify with wikipedia and LandofBasketball to be sure i was picking the right guy.

(League average, for comparison, is 54.6.) Among the players who have the most half-court matchups against All-Stars, Brooks is allowing the lowest percentage. In short, he has matched up against All-Stars more than any other NBA player, and he has defended them better than anybody else. Just one player - Lillard - has scored 40 against him this year.

We tend to cite “pace and space” as the reason for the league’s scoring spike, but that wouldn’t explain the recent jump in FT%. The league FT% has been fairly steady for decades but it’s spiked recently.

There could be several factors for this —

— teams are playing fewer “bigs,” who traditionally aren’t good free throw shooters. They’re also running the offense through the post less often, which may mean fewer FT attempts for the big dudes who are still there.

— the league-wide emphasis on shooting may mean the perimeter players (guards and forwards) are better shooters than the past. We don’t see many defensive specialists anymore, or even traditional point guards who aren’t shooters (like a Rajon Rondo type.)",ZandrickEllison,34,166,0.96

After tonights win, the Sacramento Kings are only 4 games behind from the #1 Seed Nuggets in the East, with the final game of the season being Kings vs Nuggets on April 9th. Could Could the Kings win the West?

It certainly seems possible when we look at the remaining schedule for both teams.

Kings play:

* Jazz x 2
* Suns
* TWolves
* Trail Blazers x 2
* Pelicans
* Warriors
* Celtics
* Spurs
* Mavs
* Nuggets

The Kings Strength of Schedule is: 0.498 (source: [https://www.tankathon.com/remaining\_schedule\_strength](https://www.tankathon.com/remaining_schedule_strength))

The Nuggets play:

* Wizards
* 76ers
* Suns x 2
* Rockets
* Jazz
* Nets
* Bucks
* Pelicans
* Warriors

The Nuggets Strength of schedule is: .529. (source: [https://www.tankathon.com/remaining\_schedule\_strength](https://www.tankathon.com/remaining_schedule_strength))

It may very well come down to the final game of the season where the Kings have the chance to end the season with a BEAM and #1 Seed. The Kings need to win 3 more games than the Nuggets and then beat them in the final game of the season to achieve this (with about 10 games remaining to do so outside of the final game).",6lackDino,41,131,0.92

In the West there’s GS, Minnesota, OKC and Utah. 

- I personally want to see OKC play GS to see how Shai and their young team reacts to a heavily experienced playoff team (and reigning champs) 

- Warriors in the first round against Denver could have major upset potential and add to the list of 1-seed collapses.

122,is it legal to offer a upper mid tier free agent a huge one year contract (well worth their value) with the caveat of signing a minimum the next year?,11vcap8,"



Let’s say your team (mid/large market) has a summer where a max slot (however it may cost in any given year) frees up, but no big stars are available, but, the next year - multiple top 5 players are - however, there are quite a few decent starters (like we’re talking B- to C tier dudes who are great contributes, think of guys worth 10/20 mil, for example. These guys can’t lead a team, but they’re very solid contributors. However, if you sign them to multi year deals - you lose out on your max slot. 


Now, what i want to ask if the following would be legal:

Let’s say you offer two of these players, who are normally worth 10-20mil each a huge one year contract. Ex. Two one year 30mil to them, and mention that they intend to sign a big star the next year, however, if you wish to win the championship, you must sign the minimum the next season. You don’t have to sign, you can even turn this down if another team pays you more, but just know that this is the only condition i would have to give you this large overpay for one year. 


Is such a thing legal? or would it count as tampering? you’re not giving them money under the table per say, you also aren’t making them commit to the min the next year and are basically giving the player to go to another team in the next summer if they so wish. The move does look suspicious, but is is legal?",KayRay1994,19,7,0.69

He’s averaging 14-3-4 for the full season on 45/36/89.

Also: the Kings had 13 road games (with Monk) over that span and went 10-3! Monk is unflappable and utterly fearless and a big reason for Sac having the 2nd best road record in the league this year. He ignites the offense off the bench as the only player after Sabonis and Fox who can consistently create a shot for someone else. (Don’t ask about defense, though it has improved, and he’s had some crazy highlight blocks)

138,What's the blockbuster trade you want to see (not including one for your team),11v9kgw,"I.e. A trade that you just want to see because you think it makes enough sense for both sides, and/or you think both teams need a shake up. And ideally, you're going stars being traded. 

&#x200B;

I'd like to see Bradley Beal and KAT switch teams this off season personally. I think it makes enough sense as a shake up, and the wizards might have to give up a first or something but I think that both teams are moving in a weird direction. You officially hand the keys to Ant edwards, you have these two weird teams and I think they can help each other out.",Handsome_Kian,58,15,0.74

> Dillon Brooks from the bench to Klay before the game ended:   “You suck.”

**In response to Klay showing 4 fingers, Brooks pointed at his head as if to tell the Warriors, ‘I’m in your dome***


The rivalry continues as the Grizzlies beat the Warriors again. I hope we see a playoff matchup and get to see how Brooks plays against them! He’s still a bit dirty but I love rivalries

145,New viewer: Why are the Warriors so bad on the road?,11v8ssx,"Am studying abroad in America and decided to watch and learn the sport. I don't mean disrespect to the fans of course, but as a new viewer, I have to ask why are they so bad on the road?

Of course I'm aware KD isn't on the team anymore, but Warriors crush at home with everyone scoring, a decent rotation of players, tough shots being made, etc....

It's the exact opposite on the road, they can't figure out a rotation, some players are good and others aren't, and they may even struggle with simple shots

To be fair, I've only seen the games this season, but I mean these guys are last years champions with minimal roster changes. Shouldn't they be a lot more dominant? What does this mean if a team is only good at home while being lackluster on the road?",throwaway4513786,64,36,0.74
146,If the Kings and Warriors faced off in round 1 who would win?,11v8rt0,"Imo Kings win in 7 their playoff inexperience wouldn’t help but the Warriors can’t win a road game to save their life I mean todays loss to the Grizz is the Dubs 11th straight road loss so if they met the Kings in round 1 imo while it would be a close series even as a Warriors fan I would say right now the Kings would win in 7 games.

A lot of trash talk, a lot of shooting and the Memphis Grizzlies outplay the Warriors without Ja Morant yet again.

150,"With tonight’s loss against the Grizzlies, you guessed it, the Warriors once again have an inverse home-road record.",11v8owf,"Home: 29-7

Road: 7-29

What do I even say anymore? They have the 3rd worst road record and the 3rd best home record.

Early in the season it could be written off as them simply having bad luck, or missing shots, etc. At this point is it fair to say these are essentially two different teams? If this is the case, without home court advantage in any series, what are the odds we see them bounced in the first round in 5-6? 

Furthermore, with the West play in race being so tight, it’s plausible they end up the 8 seed or worse the 9 seed and potentially have to play one of the games on the road. Many have already pencilled in the Warriors as a playoff team, but with a rough schedule and plenty of road games left, there’s absolutely no guarantee they stay afloat. 

All this to say, if the Warriors miss the playoffs, or they get bounced early in an uncompetitive series, will we see this core broken up in the offseason?",william4534,52,363,0.95
