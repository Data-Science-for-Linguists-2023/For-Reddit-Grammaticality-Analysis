* Every line is connected to every other line in one national or international grid, meaning load has to be very carefully managed both on the trains' power units, and at the links to the power plants, and presumably lines have to be able to be isolated in the event of some freak accident to avoid it bringing down every train nationwide.",Careful_Yannu,3,2,1.0

So if a lung cell mutates and is defined as cancerous, but still a lung cell how do these “anti cancer fighting” properties target it without targeting the other lung cells?

It sounds like absolute bs because with each mutation it’s made up of our own DNA which is unique to each and every one of us therefore each cancer is unique on its own. So how would these properties know what to target lol…

My mother died of cancer recently and I got this thought that all this is absolute marketing bs and seeing it on products or pushed (Soursop fruit and other stuff) really makes me angry but if I am wrong I will take the L I just need it to be explained to me like I’m 5. 

I’m assuming it’s just properties that help minimize the act of mutation itself but then that would be MINIMIZING the odds of cancer, not “fighting” already present cancer.

And... I don't think that is right? From my understanding of it, the analogy shouldn't go that far. While they might be comparable, it's certainly isn't like that for the jaguar perspective. I've read it that some things people do might transform it into another animal (like a peccary from the jaguar's perspective), but I don't think it would be exactly the same? It'd be more like.... finding a berry bush that seems safe to eat because while the tree is somewhat different the berries look tasty.

954,ELI5:Please help me understand PySpark fold method,10x2q8x," 

    `sc.parallelize([2,1,8,5],4).fold(2,lambda a,b:a+1) ` `sc.parallelize([2,1,8,5],4).fold(2,lambda a,b:b+1)`  

Spark gives 6 for first one and 4 for the second. I am not able to understand these outputs. Below is my intuition for the second example:  
Spark divides the data into 4 partitions:  
P1 -> \[2\]  
P2 -> \[1\]  
P3 -> \[8\]  
P4 -> \[5\]  


Now I apply the lambda function on each partition taking 2 as my zero value for each partition. So a is the zero value and b is the current value in each partition. So now data becomes:  
P1 -> \[2,2\] -> b+1 -> 3  
P2 -> \[2,1\] -> 2  
P3 -> \[2,8\] -> 9  
P4 -> \[2,5\] -> 6  


Now lets do the final combining for all partitions with 2 as zero value  
\[2,3,2,9,6\] -> \[4,2,9,6\] (*since a is 2 and b is 3. so b+1 = 4*) ->  
\[3,9,6\] -> \[10,6\] ->  
\[7\]

I am getting 7 as the final answer but spark gives 4. Please help me understand where I am going wrong. Looked it up online but not able to find an answer.
