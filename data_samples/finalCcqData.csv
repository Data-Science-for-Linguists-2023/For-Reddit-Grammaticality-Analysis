4,How to enforce good practices in my workplace?,11viy3c,"My team doesn't enforce good practices, and my boss said ""good practices are bad, just make what you need to do and that's it"". 

This has led to a shitty codebase, where for example, every time the use of a modal was needed, my coworkers would just create a custom modal instead of having a global one.... and we use modals EVERYWHERE

I made a big refactor (not even a refactor, just remade the codebase) since the project wasn't that big, but it's going to be, and I want to avoid technical debt. 

Normally I would just leave, but these projects need to be done right, they could help a lot of people.

8,2 YoE mentoring a 1 YoE. Tips?,11vr7au,"This is my first job and I've been called a top performer and really really sound technically. 

My manager said the next skill I should pick up is mentoring other juniors and some peers. So he's given me complete control of a mid size project (~3 months ish) execution wise. I have another junior collaborating closely with me. 

Now, my manager explicitly told me that I am not to develop anything in this project since my technical skills are already proved and it's time to go into larger stuff. My task is just overseeing execution, help my junior in designing the feature technically and identify risks. I am to help her in development only if the delivery date is at risk. 

Now, based on my interaction with her, I know she's smart. But she's unaware of a lot of design principles so most of the times, I have to explain it to her with a toy example, correlate it with our use case and then we can progress. 

She's able to grasp a lot of this stuff but she's not able to come up with this on her own when I hint at the solution. A lot of the times, she would propose something, I intentionally don't tell her why it's a bad idea and give her an alternate but fairly plausible scenario. She still can't figure it out and I point out why the design is not flexible.

Now my manager has clearly said that he's having a look at my mentoring skills to promote me. I just want to make sure both her and I get the most out of this opportunity which hopefully turns into promotions for both of us.

12,What do you do when you don't want to be a staff engineer?,11v2hvh,"Currently a senior software engineer who has about 13 years of experience. I found that recently that some of the other people I work with are getting a bit more in terms of salary than I am because they have more experience. Although they don't necessarily do more work or provide more value. So I had asked my manager what she thought was a good way for me to increase my salary. I didn't compare salaries or anything like that. I just focused on me and what I offer.

She told me that other than the annual cost of living raises. The only real way for me to get any substantial raise would be to become a staff engineer. Which I guess is the next rung on the ladder.

The issue is I really don't want to be a staff engineer. The people I've worked with who are staff engineers are all people of a certain type. It's just not something that I really want for myself.

He has a lot of relevant experience and I was told he was a good people manager so I was excited to meet him. Last week he scheduled a 1:1 with me and I gotta say the call did not go as well as I expected. Now with all my previous bosses the first 1:1 is always just a polite intro discussion where we talk about our past experience and what we hope to achieve working together. But this guy was the opposite. He didn’t introduce himself at all, and wanted to know exactly what I was working on and started assigning me tasks that he wanted done by EOD. His tone the entire time was very condescending and he sort of laughs off any of your answers (nervous tick?). He didn’t give a shit who I was at all and I could also tell he has little sense of humor. Maybe it was just a bad first impression and I would like to give him the benefit of the doubt.

22,Really conflicted between ML/CS PhD vs. fully funded MSCS,11vudmc,"Crossposting from r/AskAcademia \- thought I could get some useful knowledge from a different group of folks.

I'm in a really tough situation and have been feeling acutely ill over making a decision. I would be really grateful for some advice.

I graduated from a prestigious university with a bachelors in CS last spring, and have been working and making a really comfortable salary in a big tech company (return offer on a summer 2021 internship). I had worked with an assistant professor on ML research for the last two years and had a good and productive time; the professor really believed in me, and towards the last semester, suggested that I apply for PhD programs in that area.

I did not believe that I could get into any PhD programs this cycle, as this particular subfield is extremely competitive, and so figured that I would not seriously decide whether or not to do a PhD unless I get in. I only targeted very competitive places and applied to my undergrad's fully-funded, research-focused MS program (most likely I'd be working with the same advisor again) as a backup.

All my results came in, and I have gotten into a number of very good PhD programs, as well as the MSCS backup. Among my PhD offers, one is from a non-top 4 CS school which ranks among the top 3 of my subfield, and the advisor that I got is very, very good. The prospective PhD advisor is extremely well-connected and super nice, and my undergraduate advisor was previously affiliated with their group and could not have anything more positive to say.

Among the academic folks whom I've spoken to, the overwhelming consensus is that I should just go to the state school and work with that professor. And I feel like if I were to pursue a PhD, I would definitely take up the offer. But I've been getting very cold feet about the whole business of doing a PhD; my undergrad experience was very stressful and I just could not imagine 6 more years of lowish pay (that particular school gives the lowest stipend, despite being located in a fairly expensive city). I have zero interest in becoming a professor and would ideally like to be in research-oriented roles in the industry, and that's why I'm seriously considering the MSCS backup. At this point, I'm pretty set on going back to school, given the turbulence and ongoing layoffs in the tech industry.

Here are some direct concerns about going into the PhD:

1. Earning a livable wage and having savings are definitely very important to me and I can't justify walking away from an six-figure annual salary and living for 5-6 years on a $30K-ish PhD stipend. Comparatively, the MSCS stipend is on the higher end (\~$50K) with a good exit opportunity to industry after 2 years.
2. I love parts of the research process, but I won't deny that it was highly stressful and I came out of undergrad feeling extremely burnt out, with horrible work-life balance and a lot of unprocessed emotional issues. My quality of life has greatly improved since getting into a normal 9-5, but I just can't imagine 6 more years of going through that again.
3. Maybe the one slightly negative thing (and it's not a big issue) is that the PhD advisor is pretty hands-off given that they already have tenure and are affiliated with some industry connections. I am definitely not a very skilled researcher and would need a lot of hands-on guidance, especially in the first few years. The group is very nice, with senior students, but for the most part it seems decentralized (some people are remote / WFH), so I worry that I wouldn't be getting enough mentorship.
4. Not a huge factor, but something I'd have to mentally come to terms with: the PhD program itself has incredible prestige within the subarea, but the school's lay prestige is much lower than my undergrad's.

The primary reason for moving forward with the PhD is that this is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; this advisor is the dream advisor for many other applicants and I feel that I would not get as good of an offer again were I to decide later on in life to pursue a PhD. I am also feeling extremely pressured by a lot of people in academia to just go do the PhD and not even consider the MSCS (not a good feeling).",6ottle,1,1,1.0
23,Career switch into Software Development,11vtlig,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a 38M, and I'm in the midst of leaving my current job as a retail marijuana dispensary manager, for a company I've worked for since 2010 and I am wrestling with a couple different routes to take. My first thought is to enroll in an online coding bootcamp as that is the shorter path and from what I have found, it doesn't necessarily make you job ready, but if you really apply yourself, in time an entry level position can be found. The other option is to go back to school and take the longer, but accredited approach, and come out earning a CS degree that opens more doors than if I had no college degree and just a bootcamp certificate, which to be honest, doesn't mean much. I've been self learning for almost a year in my free time (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python) so I'm not completely uninformed of the basics of building out websites, syntax, etc., but with all the craziness of tech layoffs, hiring freezes, on top of the recession only feeling like it's gonna get worse before it gets better, I'm wondering if the slower approach of going to school for a CS degree is the safer option for someone like myself that has no college degree of any kind, and has gone from managing a medical marijuana dispensary to a recreational dispensary for the last dozen years. I'm single, no kids, no debt and will be moving in with a relative in Seattle, and they're letting me live rent free for the rest of the year until I either finish a bootcamp or start taking classes and getting myself settled in as a student again, so I am very fortunate to have a pretty easy road in front of me to pursue this career change however I decide to.

Now I feel even worse because he is watching my every move and my mental health has been deteriorating. 

In retrospect, it seems like I wasnt ready for this job and I should have studied more. I dont know what to do because we are dealing with complex logic and I don't have a mentor so no one can help me when I get stuck. 
I tried asking for help from my boss but when he tries to explain to me he loses his patience (and I barely undertand what he is saying). This gives me so much anxiety I avoid asking for his help.

36,First job as a Software Engineer: Electronic Warfare or Finance Industry?,11ujxmn,"Hello guys, I am a fresh graduate in Engineering and I am looking for my first  job as a Software Engineer. I have two main offers, one in the field of the Electronic Warfare (not in a big defense contractor, but it is still a big company of 1000 people) and one in a Banking & Finance (in a company from the ION group). In the defense company I would work as a software engineer for Electronic Warfare simulations, while in the finance company I would have the opportunity to work in the field of Trading and Execution, Compliance and Risk management in the Finance sector (the company is actually more focused on the latter two rather than trading).

So I am very confused, and I don't know what to choose (the pay is more or less the same). Indeed, while the work in the Electronic Warfare company seems to be very technical and challenging, I am  afraid that I would not bring home any relevant skill useful in other sectors. On the other side, working in the ION group would help me to understand better the Financial industry, which is always a plus point, and I would acquire more transversal skills. Nevertheless, the attention to innovation, to coding and training seems to be less present here than the defense company (which is a rarity). Moreover, the finance company has some bad reviews on Glassdor while the defense company is way better in this regard and also have some certification as ""Great Place to Work"".

Considering that I do not plan to work in either of them for more than 3/4 years, what should I prefer? I don't know anything about Electronic Warfare. It seems a lucrative business, and it will also enhance my C/C++ coding skills, but I don't understand how there exist such a big market behind ""radars"". On the other hand, the Finance Industry is always a secure choice, but I feel like the company I would go is not the ""top-notch"" in the field and there is so much competition there.

Do you guys have suggestions? What should I consider to make a sensible decision? Thank you all for the help!",ColdBlood01,40,47,0.88

My concern is the following: I don't want to end up in a job with almost no coding. I know a lot of data analysts end up doing Excel. That is not something I find appealing. I am not sure now what to do. I would like to say that I am not one of those people that want to have 3 jobs at the same time. I'd rather be paid less but have more free time.

I am applying to internships right now (I'm a junior in college) and I am fortunate enough to be one of the final candidates in consideration for this one consulting firm( top 3). They asked me to complete a Codility assessment and seemed to not put too much emphasis on its importance, but I am a little nervous as I received a 3/5. 

Will this score automatically reject me? The next stage is a casual chat with the Chief Risk Officer and then they extend offers to the top two candidates. This is my first time applying to internships so I have no idea if a score like this would normally eliminate someone outright in the tech industry, but they seem to really like me, and again, didn't place too much emphasis on the assessment so it might be used as a way to eliminate one of us if they cannot decide.

44,"26 year old fuckup, should I continue to try and learn code to be employable or just give up?",11vjvwe," 

Hello everyone I'm 26 \[M\], back when I graduated HS at 18, my mom made me go to university so we could keep up with the Joneses. So I moved to a bigger city 1 hour away to study to be a Dental Technician (making dentures, implants, crowns, veneers for dentists), fast forward during Uni I was really depressed/very high social anxiety so I could not make any friends from my class or keep up with school work due to depression and laziness.

I managed to get a few internships, interned at like 4 dental labs during the 3 year period from which I was either fired or left due to not liking the job itself and not pushing myself hard enough to learn the trade from the people there.

After finishing Dental Tech Uni, I found a place to work, at the start I was working for free for 4 months, then I got paid lower than minimum wage for 2 months before quitting due to not advancing or learning anything there, because the people there were too busy to teach me anything, so at this point I would have interned at 6 labs so far and nothing fucking sticked, so I decided to leave Dental Tech altogether.

At this point I was 22 and bought into the whole ""just learn to code bro"", so I decided to pursue that. I told my mom I was going to try to pursue coding, she told me only if I enrolled into Uni again (Uni was paid for by the government since I had good grades in highschool).

So I went to Uni for IT and my first day there I met the biggest shithead 18 year old dude which I became friends with to not be suicidal and lonely for 3 years again, this guy wanted to do alcohol and drugs every single day while his parents drove his ass to Uni and back everyday and paid for everything.

So I skipped most classes because they were way over my head (Uni level math, which I had never done in Highschool) and went drinking with that guy most days.

During my first year I tried teaching myself web development through courses and tutorials hoping for the best. Last year I finished IT Uni and got my degree and realised I barely know any programming since following courses and doing tutorial projects did not solidify barely any coding information in my brain.

Now I'm almost 26, have some very basic web dev projects on my GitHub that I can barely explain and failed my first 3 interviews that I got during the span of 6 months of applying for jobs.

I guess my question really is, should I quit programming and go back to being a Dental Technician even if I wasn't successful in that field for so long? (I would have to go back and take a couple of exams and finish my thesis since I didn't get my Dental degree).

I live with my mom and am depressed to the point where I can barely study coding for 2 hours, there are barely any jobs in the small town that I currently live in and if I did get a minimum wage job here I would be the laughing stock of everyone, since most ppl here know I went to Uni for so long.",necropoly,25,0,0.41

Worked  pretty laid-back remote jobs in smallish companies in small teams. Then I  decided to change my specialization to iOS. Started learning Swift  before moving to Canada. Then I got into an unpaid remote startup (not  Canadian) and somehow worked there for 2 years and applying to a lot of  places everywhere. Eventually I have burned out in August 2022 and quit -  just couldn’t stand a thought of working for free more than 2 years.  Now it’s almost 3 years of not having a real job or income.

I  guess I’m having a whole mix of problems here - no formal CS education,  a new specialization, no Canadian experience, questionable tiny startup  experience. I’ve been looking for Frontend jobs as well, but no luck,  not a single screening interview so far. I feel like I’m loosing my competency in web, and working in web is something I don’t really like  anymore, so it’s hard to force myself to keep the skills up, make new  projects, learn new tech, and all that on top of mobile domain, which is  my priority.

I recently completed  iOS certificate program taught by Meta. It was huge and it took me 7 months to complete. But I understand that I simply wasted my time and  money pursuing this useless certificate. It won’t help in my situation.

It is not that I was having a good time or relaxed being through all this  frustrating nonsense. I worked hard for nothing, and still working hard.  I have planned, created, modified, got through month of hoops fighting  with AppStore to release the app for that startup for nothing in return.  I completed paid certification for nothing in return other than more  knowledge which now feels unnecessary for some reason. Sometimes I feel  completely broken. I contemplate leaving tech completely every other  week when I get hit by another wall of desperation.

But at that time I got big task, and they were questioning me how much has left to do and I did not know exactly and I knew it will go over the deadline which was causing stress.

So I decided while this is so stressful period, to not study, but just relax as much as I want.

And now this stressful period ended. But I am not finding motivation to study. It feels so good to chat on social networks, watch youtube videos.

When it is work hours I work normally, not being lazy. But just when work hours end I just want to have fun. I also see on linked in so many reqruiters writing me if I want to talk. Also my company raised my salary even without me asking to do so. So it feels I am so safe and that kills motivation probably.

But I had been fired many times from jobs. So when I get fired, I think now I will get a job and on the side I have to make my business, so I can finally be my own boss and never be fired. And once I feel that safe, I lose motivation.

But knowing the history, there is no guarantee that I will not be fired. Or there can be that I myself might want to quit if I will have to work with people with whom I do not feel good, who are mobbing me. So it would be nice to still have my business. Or at least learn technologies so that I would have what to tell what I learned in the next job interview. I have something to tell. But I know learning little by little is good, adds up overtime.

&#x200B;

now if i try to force myself, I think - I might become old always workiung. Do I want to have as much fun or be as productive as possible.

I might die with lots of wealth but not used my time for fun. Is it really worth? Thats why the motivation question comess - do I need that much motivation to work/study to live best possible life? I am already getting used to work but I remember as cghild, I used every possible free minute to have fun, I did not care about money And I kind of miss those times.

On the other hand having money made me less dependant on parents who did not let me relax while playing computer games.

Mow I have money that I could buy new car for example without problems but I think the toy would soon not guve me the joy. It quickly becomes boring so its not worth to spend big money on toys. Only one reason to buy new car is safety - hopefully it would be much safer than my 2009 year car which works well and is much cheaper and in case somebody damages it - also less loss.

So I kind of do not need mucg money.

But much money could be needed if I want to easily find nice girl. I am not good with girks but with money you can buy them even if you are computer nerd. But that requires lot of money. I notice no matter how much you spend on girls, they are still not happy. So then you have to work all the time and if you have fun they start not letting you to relax. So again do I want that? I like company of girls but not sure if I can be happy in a relationship with them, considfering the price paid in money, time, emotions.

I was hired remotely for a niche tech company based in NY, also where I live. Have been here about 7 months. I took the job mostly because it was the first and really only job offer I got after an internship and a long and frustrating search. I am grateful for my first break and understand that movement elsewhere will be easier with experience. My frustration currently is that the company culture is VERY laid back if not simply lacking structure/leadership. My team consists of me another junior, and our team lead. 

**The Issue:** I want to move upward in the field and expand my knowledge of CS and development in general. I am not learning any industry-standard practices where I am. There are very few meetings, no real code reviews, no performance reviews, etc... I get that at a small (10-15) person company some of these practices might waste time or hinder efficiency but it brings an aura that lacks motivation. I am generally an outgoing person and soft skills have never been an issue for me but haven't grown these skills in the context of tech. I am learning when I have time (cs50, leetcode, building personal projects), but also don't want to make development my waking life.

**The Question:** How long should I stay before looking to move on without it looking bad? I feel bad because they do rely on our work. The other junior dev is comfortable just getting his work done and not being very present but he is probably working another job. The only positive I see in staying is having a real dev job under my belt so I don't want to take off too early. I do not think I am being set up for success and staying motivated is hard. I do not want to fall into a bad routine and also want a higher salary lol.

**TL;DR:** Bootcamp grad working first (remote) job (react dev), being underpaid? (60k) at a small tech company. No company culture, feel like I am not learning a lot/gaining industry-standard practices.

63,"First week of work after graduation, work environment feels too toxic, demanding and frustrating, Is it just me or is it with most of the startups/ companies?",11uzz6p,"To start with: I'm an international student on F1 visa - so quitting is not an option unless I've another offer. I've already used 70% of my OPT unemployment days as well (and it's very difficult to land a job in this market).

**TLDR:** Poor onboarding, worked 55hrs on weekdays, expected to work on weekends, my opinions are not valued or even acknowledged, super ambitious goals - at least from me and super low pay to justify any of the above. Week 1 into work and I'm frustrated, annoyed and pissed. I was 'expected to solve some problems', but here I'm just thinking over my decisions to join this company. Is this because I've never worked in the industry? Or is this beyond being crazy? **TLDR ends**

A bit of my technical background: I consider myself to have strong hold on programming, particularly Machine Learning. I do not have any ""industry experience"", but I've had few interns, about a year of freelance and loads of 'good' academic projects; if it matters, I've a Masters degree. I fairly consider these to make up for lack of experience and put me in a batch of 1-2 YoE. I've always loved the idea of working at a startup for following reasons: working on comparatively cooler work, brainstorming, value for my opinion, high paced work (not the work-is-life kind of high pace though).

A bit about my behavior (based on how I see and what my close one's have told): I'm (brutally) honest, and upfront about everything - if I don't like X, I'll let you know; and in terms of work, I'll expect you to work on it. The current codebase is trash. I'll let you know. The current build is not worth to make it to deployment. I'll let you know. I don't agree with you, I'll let you know.

Longer version:

Now, to start off with the actual scenario (warning: 90% rant below):

*Everything in italics are the founder/ other member's comments summarized.*

So, I start working with Company A as a Machine Learning Engineer (in theory, there's one more MLE for the past 2 years - but he knows NOTHING about ML except maybe ResNet18). Apart from me, there are 3 core engineers, the founder and a few non-tech people. Company is in a very early stage, seed phase, but already in profits so unsure about the next investment round. Below is my journey so far.

Day 1: A 30m call to tell me what project I've to work on - no examples, no samples, no onboarding, no introduction to current codebase. I was invited to the repository and asked to do everything else on my own. I was even on the wrong track for half of the day. I told myself, okay it's day one, let's see how things go.

Day 2: I come up with 'suggestions' that these are some models, techniques and ideas that we explore and see what works. *""le them: good, now deploy it in production by tonight""*. Wait what? I suggested we can spend time to figure out how this works, what options we've. Keeping most of the part anonymous: we're trying to build a model for a task that has NEVER been done in the domain. There's no dataset, there are no examples, there are no leads. To sum it, I've to come up with a solution which should takes at the very least 2-3 weeks (possibly even months) of work; and finish it in a day. EOD: I tell them this is best we've right now, and it doesn't even look like 5% accurate.

Day 3: *We're still going to push it, so do it.* All frustrated, clueless, I wrap the code, tell them it's done and guess what? I have to integrate it with existing code without any knowledge and the other members denying to hop on a call because it is supposed to be *""my task"".* All they did was point me to 2 utility functions that are a part of what I'll use after everything is done. Other than that, I've no clue what's happening (there's no documentation/ comments - only way is to go line by line and trace process; this triggers me because they can literally hop on a 10m call and explain me instead of asking me to spend 4-5hrs trying to do it on my own). Finally, I push out the model, as expected, it barely keeps up with expectations and that's done.

Day 4: *Okay you deployed it, but it's not exporting correctly.* Wasn't I using YOUR code to export? Why am I to debug that? Anyways, I do that, and I'm directly assigned another task which is to be deployed by end of next day. To ensure we're on the same page, I confirmed it with 2 people (founder and 1 team member) that I see a function which uses external API in location X, which I'm to change with an in-house model. They agree and I start working on it. Summary: Change X with Y.

Day 5: I had commitments in the evening, so I login earlier (8am) and let the everyone know I need to leave at 6pm (10hrs of work is already MORE THAN ENOUGH). I make a deployment, not happy with the results, I rollback to previous version and 5:30pm I let them know the status. History again, forced to deploy *('if it doesn't work, we'll take the responsibility').* I push it back, deploy and done. Now guess what? They don't just want it to be \`X -> Y\`, they want it as an API - which is pain, because of its dependency on the existing codebase. I let them know I've a commitment to keep up and I need to leave. If needed, I can take a look when I return, or have it on priority on Monday (PS: the old X works as well, so it wasn't like the customers would see any difference). But no, I'm to build the API and push it today itself before leaving. Fair, I do my part. I test locally, everything works; I let them know. The other co-worker, who takes care of pushing the deployments, wasn't around - I waited around 10m. I was already 2hrs late for my commitment, so I sign off letting them know that I've pushed and left.

Day 6 (today - we schedule a 'chat' for yesterday's events): *You weren't allowed to leave before you test everything* (FFS? I TOLD YOU I NEED TO LEAVE AT A PARTICULAR TIME. I'M STAYING BACK FOR YOUR LAST-MINUTE CHANGES AND YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT MORE FOR A COWORKER TO COME AND DEPLOY FOR WHICH I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN?). *Since your joining, your work isn't meeting our performance criteria* (Hello? You want me to understand the complete problem statement, come up with a novel solution, collect the dataset, research all possibilities, experiment with the models, implement the final one and test it - all of this in 2 days while also dealing with your existing codebase? Sorry, but this is not ""select \* from table"" we're talking about: not saying SQL is easy by any means\*) *Now, I want you to fix the yesterday's deployment before Monday AND work on your previous model and give me an improvement.* (Um, I thought you were taking the responsibility for the yesterday's work? And why am I asked to work on weekdays if I already poured freaking 55hrs on the weekdays? And for the previous model, I WILL NEED MORE TIME, A LOT MORE THAN 2 DAYS). *So, get working on it, and finish it before Monday. Also, we need further improvements on the previous model before next Friday and you're being assigned to 2 other tasks as well.* (No comments, I was just quite after this part).

I'll break down both perspectives, so it'll give a better understanding of where my frustration is coming from.

Their POV:

* I'm one of the initial hires, which makes it fair for them to expect more from me.
* The current employees had never followed 'best practices', which explains the current state of codebase.
* They may have some deadlines to meet, which explains the quicker deployments, even if unfinished.

My POV:

* If you're expecting me to work 55hrs on weekdays, AND THEN work on weekends; I'm not taking 55-60% of what an average engineer is paid in my region (I'm paid way less than average pay for a SE).
* Fair, your current codebase isn't too easy to deal with for a newcomer. Care to have an onboarding to tell me where to look for? Right now, I just have access to the repository, and the rest is on me to figure it out because apparently, ""it's my job.""
* I don't see how putting out a useless model to production makes any sense - this is available to all the existing customers. Doesn't that have a negative impact over your reputation?

For me, no matter how much I try to improve my mood and push myself to start liking the work; all of the above keeps pushing me further away and makes me want to see the job only as a placeholder for my visa till I get another job. I tried having a conversation with the founder. For any doubts I've regarding existing codebase, *""this is your job to figure it out""*; and for any questions regarding the work culture/ quality/ ambitious goals: *""this is how we work""*.

So, at this point, I can't tell if I'm being overwhelmed by the amount of work, or frustrated because of being ""bossed around"", or angry because they ""don't care"" for my personal life and commitments (this is what the founder said outright to me) but they expect me to care about their product and take the responsibility. I had a talk with few of my close ones and everyone had a different opinion. Some say it's almost how everyone works (or every company has its own issues), let few weeks pass. Some argue it's too much and I should start looking for other offers ASAP (if so, how do I justify my 1 week of experience?).

66,Advice for asking boss to relocate and work remotely permanently?,11ut3ps,"Some background: I’ve been working at medium sized company for about 2 years out of college now as a full stack developer (node, react, AWS). I started out with a very low salary with no internships. About a year ago I got an offer from another company and accepted a counter-offer to stay for a salary in the low six figures. I’m happy with my job and the company is still doing well despite the economic downturn with no signs of slowing down.

I worked remotely out of state for a couple months last year and have been looking to move there since. My job required a return to office 3 days a week 6 months ago and almost no one including upper management shows up more than once a week. We also have a bunch of employees out of state that will work remotely indefinitely, but HR is not allowing “remote conversions” at this time.

I’m in a weird situation in that I’m well respected at my current job, but I can’t find a new job that will pay close to what I make with the market downturn. I’ve had around 10 interviews over the past 6 months and received a couple offers below my current salary so far, but I wasn’t really interested in these companies anyways.

One thing I have to my advantage is that I have a good rapport with my boss and the tech VP and they have struggled with attrition over the past year, so I don‘t think they are willing to just let more people go. My boss said he personally won’t enforce any office mandates and won’t be complying with RTO. The company can clearly accommodate remote despite HR policy, as they have remote employees around the country. 

I feel like it would be foolish to leave a solid job in this current market as it puts me on the top list for layoffs, but at the same time it has been rough for my mental health living here and looking to move asap.

Any advice for pushing to be allowed to relocate and work remotely at my current job? I’m trying to make a case in a way that I don’t risk losing my job, while also conveying that relocating is something that’s really important to me.",philodendron305,1,2,1.0

I have been with a small but very active company for the past 5 years.  I got hired before I even finished an associates degree and never finished it.  I have always delivered on time and have done some really amazing things.  Building entire applications from scratch and integrating new ideas into existing software (often on my own and alone).  Going to customer sites to debug and fix on the spot, Given an idea and told to make it work without proper planning.  Getting things done in tight deadlines.  But that's just how the company is and has been normal given I got hired here as my first interview into the field. They gave me senior software engineer title this year.  

Here's the kicker, I never really thought I was a particularly good programmer.  I sometimes struggle with structuring my program and often times can't see the bigger picture until it's to late and I'm stuck rewriting code.  I make a decent salary and anyone that leaves our company moves on to get a 30k a year pay increase (often after a single year or two).  They say how much easier the work is and I've always been scared to leave due to my personal life and needing something stable in it for one reason or another.

He put into perspective that the way we work is NOT how big companies work.  In big companies they have an idea, draw it out, get exactly what they want you to do before it ever reaches a programmer.

I have been averaging a few hours of work a week for a while and this iteration (about 2 months of work) they assigned me a bunch of work that I have basically already done. I told my tech lead, (who is my direct report) and he told me not to say anything on our standup to our PM. It seems like he wants to keep a huge buffer in case of extra work, but it feels like massive inefficiency to me. I thought I must ramp up to a consistent workload soon and instead it's going in the other direction.

Having so much downtime is a blessing and a curse. I'm grateful for it much of the time but I also can't shake these feelings on the downside:

1. I feel incredibly expendable and thus fireable if budget cuts come
2. I still have to be near my computer for unscheduled calls, so I sit around on my phone or ""wasting time"" during work hours
3. I'm not growing very much. I could practice leetcode or study other things but I'm not always motivated to do that without some external motivator
4. I live in some fear that I could get on a call with a higher-up and if they grill me on what I've accomplished recently it's gonna be a bunch of BS

* I am a maintainer for a dotenv linter.
* I've contributed a few bug fixes to a game engine library (Bevy)

They figured that training IT professionals on the service offered would be just as much work as training someone from the industry on software support, so they were open to either. 

I recently started specializing in integration support issues, I'm on a plan to move to Senior Support this summer & my manager spoke with me about a potential API Integration Specialist career path. I spoke with one of our Integration Specialists who thought this was a great idea as they need to grow their team. Here's the thing, I'm pretty sure he assumed I have a stronger IT/CS background than I actually do because he shared a bunch our clients API pages to so that I could familiarize myself with them, told me to brush up on REST/RESTFUL API testing, JSON, XML & to start playing around with Postman. The problem is that I have zero idea where to even start because I don't know how any of this stuff works. I'm also feeling a bit out of my league because the Integration Specialist I spoke with has a Masters in CS & here I am with diddly squat that relates education wise.

But the thing is, I really want to do this and I have 6 months at the very minimum before I'd need to start making any moves to transition to the Integrations team. So I started doing some research and the consensus was that I should really get the fundamentals of JS/HTML/CSS down before I start with XML, studying REST/RESTFUL APIS & messing around with Postman/JSON. I've started Udemys JavaScript 0-Expert course and I'm  planning to move to the rest once I've got the fundamentals down.

97,So I overslept my last 2 daily standup meetings and it seems like my manager did not notice or just did not care/mention it? A bit scared idk,11tzstw,"TLDR: junior dev overslept 2 standups in a row. Manager has said nothing and seems like he hasn't noticed. Very worried he has and will pip me.

I'm a junior dev currently wfh and I've been at this company for about 3.5 months. This is not a normal occurrence at all I am always at standup but yes I've been an idiot and overslept past today's and yesterday's (well for yesterday I missed the entire standup and today I was only in it for the final 3 minutes of a 15 minute standup). 

Our current standups for the past 3 weeks, since we got our new manager, have been 15 minutes with about 12-15 people and we no longer do individual updates like we did under our previous managers standups so most standups I do not speak at all (I really only speak if I need something or have a blocker) especially now that there is this super heavy focus on this migration project and the more senior developers are far more important for that. 

I've only every missed standup once before these past 2 days which was about 3 months ago, when I had just joined the company, and I had overslept. Since my old manager did make us all do individual updates he did notice that I was not there and he emailed me on outlook, called me multiple times on teams, and called me on my personal phone number to reach out. When I finally woke up I told him I had had painful headaches that morning so I was unable to attend and I took PTO for the 2 hours I wasn't online as requested by the old manager. Since then I haven't missed standup before the last 2 days 

I have actually communicated with my current manager both today and yesterday for things not related to standup (like gaining access to a certain database to modify a stored procedure and discussing a bug I am working on) and it has been just a normal conversation with me missing standup not being brought up at all. Like it seems like he did not notice or does not particularly care. Normally if I missed something he does let me know immediately (like 2 weeks ago I forgot to submit my timesheet on time so he let me know) but he hasn't mentioned anything at all or asked me to take PTO or use any flex hours for missing standup

We have one on ones every Wednesday and last one on one he just asked me how I was doing, wanted to check in cause I'm still relatively new (and I have not been properly onboarded yet since my old manager forgot and my new manager is either too busy or also forgot after promising to start onboarding me about a few weeks ago this company is a chaotic mess) and it was a normal Convo. I have never been called out for performance or discipline/conduct yet or received any warning yet in fact I have been previously praised for performance and communication 

Idk I'm just hyperworried about getting PIPed at the next one on one with my current manager due to this (plus the fact that I'm kinda taking longer than expected on this bug and not getting much help from senior devs cause they're all busy. Plus I feel like compared to all other devs I do less work esp cause they are far more important for this new migration project).",miMinaminoManeMinoMo,27,15,0.68

Looking at the state of this sub, things aren't looking really good right now.

Would it be better to get the degree over with ASAP or to wait out a bit?

Or, if you're more pessimistic, is getting a degree at all worth it now?

I feel extremely unmotivated to do the work, and when I do do the work, I feel horrible afterwards, get a headache, or a stomachache.

I'm leaning heavily towards just quitting this QA job this Monday. But I'm scared this would make it very difficult to break into CS again, since now I would have a red flag on my resume. 

I still live with my parents and I have a decent amount of personal savings, so it's not like my life depends on it, and I think I could go back to my old decently paying job if I end up jobless for months, in the meantime I could really double down on learning data structures and algorithms and other gaps in CS knowledge I have as a self taught person, and focus on getting a job that doesn't make me miserable, if my red flags don't end up too big.

The advice for projects usually seems a little abstract, people just say “find a problem in your life and fix it” but I really can’t think of any problems that would require a new piece of software to fix, and even if I did I have no idea how to go about making it, even though I can do algorithm questions.

Just need a little bit of guidance, if there are any online courses that would be worth taking, or any books you could recommend, I would really appreciate it. Thanks guys!",carti-fan,7,1,0.6

Every week it seems like this guy manages to merge something that breaks shit, and I end up being the one who finds it and has to take time to fix it.

I'm at the point now where I can't trust anything this guy puts out. I've at least got him to stop putting up 70+ file PRs but somehow bugs are still getting through.

I'm currently in the process of trying to make our tests more readable and maintainable since currently they are extremely difficult to change (guess who wrote them) but in the mean time I feel like I have to put each PR of his under a microscope if it touches any critical code paths. He also rewrote one of our APIs a few months ago but it now is slower and less performant and we are having to go back and try to rework things to be more performant.

What's frustrating about this is he's supposed to be a Senior level engineer. Every week i get pulled off of sprint work to fix this guy's bugs or performance issues he introduced and it's really starting to get to me.

And maybe part of this is on me, for not knowing the system well enough at first and thinking his changes seemed OK at a glance when I was still ramping up.

This sprint I was really hoping to work on some new functionality and architecting a new service but of course that got pulled out to work on API performance issues that were introduced by my coworker a few months ago.

Our software architect is aware of this guy's shoddy work and I've vented to him a few times but it doesn't change the fact that I still have to spend time cleaning up after him. Which inevitably leads to me feeling incredibly frustrated and demotivated. Our APIs are used by other teams in our org and it's embarrassing that every week someone had a new bug to report and inevitably the git blame points back to him nearly every time without fail.

130,Thoughts on working with proprietary low-code tools and technologies,11tqsw5,"I am interning at a company where I work almost exclusively with proprietary tools and technologies. Think Salesforce but for other business cases. I do coding in python, JS, and SQL but not as in-depth nor do I spend my time coding as much as a regular developer would. My manager confirmed that he will give me a return offer.

As I am only an associate's student, my knowledge of the industry and of theoretical CS is not as fleshed out. Therefore, I would like to ask some questions.

Should I be expecting a higher-than-average salary for a junior developer role (relative to where I live) considering that I am expected to specialize in obscure low-code technologies that do not have as much overlap with regular developer roles, therefore it makes me less employable for those roles later on? If so, by how much? The average here for a junior dev is 40-45k in USD with a bachelor's degree.

Is OpenAI allowed to attempt to automate proprietary technologies which they or Microsoft do not own such as the Apex language for Salesforce? Yes, I am asking this for job security.

134,Need Career Advice,11u1wse,"Hello, everyone. I'm writing this in hopes of receiving some constructive advice on my situation and future in the industry.

Quick background: I'm graduating remotely in two months with my master's in CS, but my bachelor's was in Computer Engineering, so I understand low-level and embedded systems a bit as well as circuitry. I found ARM and PicoBlaze Assembly extremely easy, but C++ rather difficult since I was self-taught and skipped C++ courses in college. I enjoy Python nowadays and am trying to break into Robotics or AI. I have one year of experience at a Fortune 500 company in a Firmware Validation role, but it's totally unrelated to what I'd like to pursue. I recently started an Android app project where I plan to learn Firebase and Tensorflow for Computer Vision. I don't have much experience with Computer Vision, but in my grad program I have taken 2 ML courses, advanced algorithms, and graph data mining. I have nearly 2 years of experience leading teams in school projects and at previous jobs. I can read some Japanese and Spanish, as well as understand + speak even more. Additionally, I'm currently living in Japan and waiting for my wife's spouse visa to be processed before moving back to the US, but was hoping I could use a job offer as a means of visa expedition for her.

My questions are:

1) Will a company be willing to hire me remotely and let me begin work overseas before moving back to the states if I kept my US bank account and don't plan on remitting money? I figured they might be able to hire me based on my previous state of residency?

2) With a master's degree and 1 year of professional experience, do I qualify for a mid-senior level role? If so, would that be a Senior, Staff, or Principal Engineering position?

3) If I don't feel confident in my desired role, but really want to work at the company, what route would you recommend?

4) I can't seem to get interviews, but I've updated my resume to be ATS-friendly and since I have many years of projects and a diverse set of skills, it is now 2 pages long. Any advice on getting a recruiter to notice me?

5) I recently created a portfolio website. I have so many programs I wrote in school, but only a few personal projects. Should I keep my GitHub to relevant/impressive projects or upload everything?

6) With all of the big tech layoffs recently, what's the general consensus in the industry as far as what companies are stable and/or easy to get a job at?

7) I feel like there's so much more depth to my personality, leadership skills, and experience than I can fit on my resume. However, I'm having trouble getting an interview. Any recommendations for how I can showcase my entire self beyond a resume?

8) I really want to work remotely because that's what I've become accustomed to, I know where I want to live, and my wife is not comfortable being alone in the US at first with her broken English and inability to drive (she's never owned a car). Any tips on appealing to companies for remote positions? (I noticed most remote positions are mid-senior level)

9) Has anyone used a job agency to assist in finding you a job? Did it work? Was it expensive? Is it worth it?

10) I read that levels.fyi can negotiate offers of ~$30k+ on top of original offers. Is this a legit service?

As someone who has spent majority of their career in startups, this is a new concept for me to ""catchup"" with a manager. I figured early on that sharing status updates is moot since senior/lead engineers are the ones who keep track of that stuff and my manager isn't bothered by them.

I've already discussed few career progression topics such as ticking off the ""things to do"" list before getting a shot at a promotion. Now i'm beginning to find it increasingly difficult to keep the conversation lengthy and worthwhile enough in successive meetings that i'm starting to wind up these weekly meetings within minutes.

All in all, I guess I feel a bit guilty that I dont know how to effectively use their time and whether I even know what I should be using this time of ours for.

Please DM me if you fit the requirements. If you have a clearance, you WILL get good comp from my understanding.

Love all of you <3

Edit - Pay band is between 90-140k depending on what you can do. We dont care too much about YOE. Maybe im silly but I dont think its that bad.

Edit2 - I also want to clarify, our barrier for entry right now is that you can solve problems and dont have a problem if you dont have a developed skillset in testing. We are willing to invest the time and training.

140,AI/ML Startup or Famous Non-tech Company for Summer internship? Struggling to Choose,11tzw3i,"Hello! I am very fortunate that I have two offers for the coming summer and I am struggling to choose, and I would like to hear what others think of this. The first option is an internship with a famous company (but their product is not tech) and the second option is an AI/ML startup. I'm currently pursuing my bachelors in CS, and AI/ML is the CS field I want to go into after I graduate; I've heard that it is very difficult to get roles in that field without any grad school, so I feel very fortunate to have this opportunity. I'll list some points about each role that might inform your advice if you have any:

**Option 1: Big Non-tech company**

* \~$40/hr and housing is covered
* On-site in Bay Area
* Some friends from college would also be doing it with me
* It's a company everyone has heard of
* The company's product is not really tech related - ofc they use tech since it's 2023, but I don't even know what my work would involve (could very well be 'go work on the website')
* Someone told me it might look better on a resume, since its a big name and its bay area
* I've already 'accepted' this offer bc it presented itself in November, vs the other just recently

**Option 2: AI/ML Startup**

* \~$30/hr
* Remote (which I think I prefer)
* I am currently working with them this Spring so I'm familiar with the managers and the tech used
* It's in AI/ML, which is what I want to do for my career
* It's a startup which is less 'secure', but I don't get the feeling they'll crash and burn soon (they've gained a few hundred-thousand users since I joined them a couple months ago)
* They have a sort of hands-off management style and trust me to get work done on my own which I like bc it forces me to problem solve and learn more things on my own
* They've given the implication that they're interested in continuing to work with me in the future/post-grad

Hello all,

I know this will strengthen of the stigma of self-learners ruin the industry but please let me explain.

I have worked in IT and started as Service Desk Support and moved up to Technical Support Specialist for the software that are used by customers so I used JavaScript mainly to identify issues. I was looking for work and saw an opportunity for Junior role and passed the interview and got hired.

I was very clear with my hiring manager that I would not call myself a developer and I am lacking in a lot of areas and he said ""We will see your technical expertise with the homework that we will assign"" so I passed it and they were very pleased.

Now I started working I took over a project that around 10k lines of code and it is 80 percent done. The previous developer left the company and I was tasked to finish this project. This project has been going on since 2021 (I looked at the initial documentation).

The issue is I have never even wrote a project that was over 300 lines. I was not told that I need to know CSS,HTML because this project is GAS web App. I am trying to understand the codebase but everything is referring to another function or another variable that was created in another file. There were 30/40 files that was in source file (GAS sucks with foldering system so I started using CLASP to utilize VSCode) 15 of these files have comments on the beginning that says //DEPRECATED and I do not know why they are still here and I am afraid to touch them.

I feel like this is a bit unfair( Yes, I am aware I am being a whiny person) The previous dev had 2 years of time to develop and talk with the customer (It is a web app to be used internally so customer is my colleague actually) I did not have any of those perks. I am struggling to understand what the code does. I feel that trying to understand other's code is much harder writing it on your own.

I was stupid to stay quiet because I was afraid to be seen as a stupid person so 3 months have passed. I really don't know what to do. I got stuck with a codeblock and asked senior colleague. The answer was really vague. He told me that this code should work but does not know why it gives an error in the console.

I am really open to any ideas and suggestions. You can downvote this post but I would be really glad for and CONSTRUCTIVE critism to come through other side as a stronger developer. Thank you very much for reading this long post. IF need be, I can provide more information except personal ones.

159,How would I be using SQL as a Sales Analyst on daily basis?,11tnfwc,"Sort of anxious as SQL experience was mandatory but still got the new job. Funny enough, with Python/VBA and lacking SQL 'company' experience. Don't know what made the employer tick. Its not like I have massive SQL experience, writing queries daily or something.

I have 1.5 years without commercially using SQL, but I did practice SQL queries with problems here and there, just in case my ideal company came that required SQL skills.

For 1.5 years, I was trying to keep my SQL afresh in case a job landed that did required SQL.  Therefore, I did tell them during interview I am familiar with TSQL and SSMS since that is where I largely practised my queries on personal laptop with dummy data.

My experience with SQL has mostly been doing exercises (e.g. SQL problems book) and Udemy courses where SQL was mostly used as DQL.

Never used SQL in my previous jobs on daily basis. Only used SQL query in Microsoft Access and built a warehouse for connecting to PowerBI.

So I am anxious and have got 1.5 weeks to revise SQL so that I am not stuck at my new job without a clue what I will be doing with SQL on a daily basis.

* Any clue how I would be using SQL in a sales analyst role on a daily basis?
* Would I be connecting these queries with PowerBI?
* Using these queries to answer quick questions within SSMS or exporting tables?

Just trying to get the idea, you get what I mean.

160,Where do I go from here?,11tdkw4,"I'm almost entirely self taught, I don't have much formal experience, but got through most of a degree before dropping out because it wasn't interesting. most of it was online, it also wasn't doing great things for my mental health and felt like a waste of time and money.  I passed when I was healthy, and spent most of my time just working on personal projects instead of uni related things, especially since the work took very little time and felt like I was just jumping through hoops. I've won a few CTFs and am mostly interested in cyber security and networking.  

I've been working  a new job as a ""network engineer"" for about half a year, it's my first real job.  Since I've started, I've been given full responsibility of the network at this company of around 50 people.  I am writing ansible scripts for the vyos routers I deployed, and have to maintain the pfsense routers that are configured in the most.... interesting.... ways and still need to exist for existing things that have yet to be migrated.  I'm maintaining most of the servers in the rack and have been the one deploying them, securing them, networking them, and documenting it.  Existing servers are Xen based, with some esxi servers, and I'm deploying servers using libvirt on gentoo.  I've also made a passbolt server for the team that is used heavily, prior, we just used one password for everything.  I'm also currently having to write custom software to wrap the entire process our department mostly relies on, because the software we have to use is super shaky and things have been falling through the cracks a lot, something that has been a growing issue since before I joined.  On top of this, I have to be on call for 40 hours out of the week, something that I will apparently not have to do any more if the department grows, but for the time being, is a requirement.

I feel like this is a lot of work/responsibility and my total pay is below 60k, and I live in a major city in the US.  I feel I'm providing a ton of value, but not really being paid well, and I it was a real pain even getting a job because I didn't have a degree, or other work experience despite being more than qualified.  I'm the only one at the company that seems capable of doing this networking/sysadmin work, and on top of that, these are all tasks I've taken for myself. Nobody is telling me do do this stuff, I just see what is currently in place needs improvement, and I've been very successful in integrating new things.  Within a month of working there, I was able to set up a new VPN, and supporting things which allowed the entire team to work from home, something that we leverage heavily now.  I just don't see a raise coming and I feel the market isn't great right now, and I can't list very much ""experience"", but have so many technical skills, especially when it comes to Linux.

164,"Getting super annoyed at my CEO's (and general management's) obsession with ChatGPT and ""generative"" AI... Anyone else?",11sd631,"This ended up sounding more like a rant so I apologize in advance. Please skip if you're not up for that.

I'm a MLE for a startup. I've done research in ML/NLP in grad school and am also currently doing research. My CEO also (supposedly) has an AI background but can't stop talking about ""how amazing"" ChatGPT and other ""generative"" AI is (I use double quotations for ""generative"" because I think it's a misnomer, but that's for a separate conversation).

That's fine. Again, as someone who also does research in AI I think the state of generation models is remarkable. The problem is that my CEO (and other management) keeps thinking that we could implement ChatGPT and co. into our business without really thinking about it.

A typical conversation that I have at least thrice a week goes something like this:

```
CEO: Why aren't we using ChatGPT?
Me: Well I don't think that we really have any use cases for it and it'd be too expensive to run.
CEO: Well how about we do something like automatic labeling for our data?
Me: We already have trained models to do that. We could just use those and manually inspect the outputs.
CEO: How about we do something like product recommendation through text generation?
Me: There are tons of open source text generation models that do that without having to be ChatGPT.
CEO: You're being too close-minded. It's so hard to communicate with you.
Me: Um okay.
```

What's funny is that my CEO supposedly went to grad school at one of the best technical universities in my school and has a background in AI.

I thought my Twitter and LinkedIn feed being flooded with ChatGPT was bad enough, but having to deal with these questions that the answers are clear to with just a tiny bit of thinking is starting to really irk me...

**Edit**

It's a little funny. You can tell who's actually studied about or knows about AI just from the types of comments they're making. Anyone who's serious about AI knows to give credit where credit's due, but not to take it too seriously.

I made a couple of shitty little beginner web apps when I was first applying for jobs because I had no experience, but none of them are an accurate reflection of my current experience and most of them are broken anyway since I haven't maintained them for 4 years. Nothing I've worked on at my company can be directly shown to anyone since it's all proprietary code; the best I can do is vaguely describe the apps and specific things I've done to improve them.

I could make a handful of new portfolio projects of course, but to make something that's actually impressive for my current skill level would take a lot of time and energy that I could be spending applying to jobs. So I'm wondering: if I have 4 years of experience already, how much does a portfolio really matter?

To add to that I was hired shortly after graduating and I worked there for approximately 4 months. However, as a result of a change in circumstances, I found myself needing to move back home to be with my parents.

""Luckily"" I managed to secure a fully remote role that paid more than the role I had been working at for four months in person. It seemed like a no-brainer so I took the job offer. At first, everything seemed great. I had regular weekly meetings with my manager and they always told me I was doing a great job and thanked me for my hard work. Despite that, the reason I say ""luckily"" is because 4 months after quitting my first job and moving 500 miles. I was laid off in a company-wide layoff from the remote role I quit for. They stated it was due to a refinancing deal that fell through which left them lacking cash flow.

This brings me to today where I have been applying daily for four months with nothing but a single interview to show for it. I don't understand what it is I am doing wrong. I suspect my disjointed work history is scaring off potential employers but I am not certain. I am an honest person and I don't like to lie, but I am starting to consider simply pretending I worked at 1 company for 8 months before being laid off instead of 2 companies for 4 months each.

I don’t really have any intent to try to go FAANG, or anything of that sort. I live in the Midwest, and don’t intend to relocate. So are these challenges in the career field hitting everywhere across the country? Or are these more isolated to the major tech hubs? 

Thank you in advance!",KeyLong5412,233,294,0.86

185,How to Find my Path?,11t97f9,"Hi, I am from Italy and I am in my early 20s. I am struggling to find a path in my life. It's been a year of research on how to figure out how to travel and work remotely at the same time. I hate my life, I still live with my parents (tbh it's normal here in Italy) and I want to move out and start traveling/moving to a new country and living life while also getting an income, possibly as far from here as possible. 
My life is shit right now and I need to press a reset button.

My idea would be to be a freelancer working from anywhere in the world living in low cost of living countries in SEA/Latin America so that I don't even need to do freelancing full time since even with 1-2k I can live well in those countries.

I am trying to learn how to design and make websites on webflow and then start looking for clients on Upwork or other freelancing platforms. I know that in the beginning it's gonna be hard but maybe it is doable. I don't want a full time job because I would hate it and also because it's hard to find a company that would let me work from anywhere in the world due to tax/timezones etc. (can you confirm?).

It's also been a year since I am having no-sleep nights where I try to think on a possible solution and after some months I found out that that part time freelancing idea could be a good fit for me but I am still not sure about that and I'm not even sure if I would really like to design and develop websites but I don't have other many alternatives besides digital marketing or maybe UX Design.

I am going through quite possibly the most discouraging time of my life at the moment. Throughout undergrad I slacked off and just didn't apply myself as much as I should have. I didn't really feel passionate about software engineering until around senior year which is right around when things started to go downhill, just my luck.

As it stands, I graduated fall 2022 with 0 internships and have been feeling completely lost. Even if I do somehow build a decent portfolio of projects, I then have to face a competitive, over-saturated junior dev job market.

I have applied to startups, government jobs, looked into contracts, anything you can think of to get my foot in the door, but nothing. When I was applying to new grad roles last fall, I got a couple bites, but since those roles have been filled I have not heard back from anyone. I apply to around 10 roles a day on average. I have considered grad school but it's just too expensive for me and my family.

I no longer qualify for new grad roles, which means I now have to go for roles that require 2+ YOE.

I am grinding Leetcode everyday and just trying to pick up new tools (React/Express) in the meantime to build projects so I keep my mind sharp, but it's getting super discouraging.

I know that my lack of internship and professional experience is my fault for not dedicating myself in undergrad, but it honestly feels like I will never land a software engineering role at all and I'm terrified that I'm gonna have to let my degree go to waste and find something else.

I will try my best to keep trudging along and building projects/grinding Leetcode, but is there any hope for me? Do I just have to wait out this bad market? Recent news about SVB just added onto my anxiety rip

189,Should I write a cold email to the team lead at my dream company?,11thc9y,"Hi!

This week, I applied for a data science job at my dream company.

From what I can see on LinkedIn, the data team lead has the same academic background as I do. He completed his PhD the year I was born, became a professor, and then transitioned to DS around the 2008 recession. I completed my PhD a few years ago, and got my first data science position shortly after. For additional information, the field of academia we share is tiny - a subfield of physics with about 2,000 people worldwide.

**Should I write a cold email to the team lead?** My goal is to boost my chances for an interview.

I'll add that the job posting did not have the team lead's email. I ended up finding his email on RocketReach. It does not look like he's very active on LinkedIn, otherwise I'd send him a message there. Unfortunately, it also doesn't look like he's kept up with anyone in our field of academia, otherwise I'd wrangle an intro.

I know that it is often recommended to get into various companies, and in certain areas like Data Science and AI, I see many people saying that it is even mandatory to get a job.

My problem is the following, does it matter much what university the person graduated from? I speak because I currently take CS at the University of the People, an online non-profit university that the U.S. government recognizes, currently I do this more for having in the curriculum an American university and everything else with the goal of applying for jobs outside of Brazil. The point is that as I do not earn in dollars, this is weighing for me the amount I pay that is little for those who live in a country with a strong currency, but for those who do not live, it is costly.

I was then thinking of doing a university here in Brazil, which ended up being cheaper. The problem I see is this being an issue after applying for jobs in other countries, especially for areas like AI that I mentioned above, which I would like to follow; what about this?",KingMaster80,2,0,0.33

* Ability to work remotely
* Easier to start a startup
* Ability to work in any industry

Background:
- I am finishing up my PhD in Spain and would have to relocate
- i am a US citizen but have lived in EU for the last 15 yrs (moved when i was 16) 
- i do not know how to drive because EU has great public transport and have never needed it. 

Things i need advice on 

- How is the work life balance in California Bay Area ? 
- is the salary enough to live comfortably? Rent, extra expenses i would need to pay to live in Cali etc. (after doing some research, damn is California expensive in comparison) 
- can i get to work without a car? 
- Would it be difficult to relocate coming from Spain without much savings and the savings I have would maybe last me like a month at most 
- Would i be able to rent a small 1bd apartment from abroad or is that sketch?

203,Is it normal for US based companies to lowball remote senior hires from EU that much?,11tb92k,"Just had this weird experience:

Applied to a US based company as a remote senior android dev. 

Told them my rate was 55usd/hour. 

Their internal recruiter who is based in Poland told me that their budget is max 45 usd/hour max for a senior role. 

I was like ok maybe its worth a shot.

Passed the initial interview, did the technical interview, seemed like I did really great.

Today I receive an offer from that recruiter of 30 usd/hour. Feedback was that Im senior in some areas but in most of them Im a ""really strong mid level"" so they cant offer senior rate for me. Right now Im thinking of how to respond to that.

What is this? Seniors are expected to know everything 100 percent? Every senior I worked with usually specializes in 2-3 areas and looks up others as he goes. I guess shes trying to lowball me or something.

To be honest this is hilarious for me. If I wanted I could land a contracting gig with same 30usd/hour in my city 5 miles away from my home (Im based in Latvia, capital city Riga). But this is US based company so what the heck? Am I being gaslighted? Or is this rate the new normal?

Maybe Im being delusional here, should I manage my expectations or something?

204,Recent grad worries,11t1xbj,"Hello everyone. 

I just graduated from UMD in the winter with a BS in computer science, and I’m pretty worried about getting my first job…

For starters, I am an older graduate, turning thirty next week actually, and so throughout college I had to work full time. I worked in retail and restaurants to support myself. Consequently, I didn’t ever get an internship, and work sometimes interfered with my studies. My gpa was only around 2.3 after a long and complicated college career spanning from age 18-29. I also never really had time to develop personal projects, so all I have to put on my resume is my degree and class projects. I still put my work experience down for now, but am planning on taking it out…

As of now, since I’m out of school and have free time, I just apply everywhere I can, and decided to start some projects. My best class was web development with JavaScript, so I decided to learn reactjs, and I want to develop a MERN stack app to put on my resume. Right now I’m doing some react tutorials to get a feel for the framework and refresh from the class, since I took it a while ago… but I think the career path I want to go down is full stack development. I enjoy all aspects of it, designing ui/ux, coding server side logic, setting up and populating databases, I want the whole package. But obviously I’d take the first job I can land. 

So far I’ve had to turn a couple of interviews down because they required security clearances which I don’t want to deal with (am not eligible). I started applying in the beginning of February and have had 4 phone interviews so far. I haven’t had a technical interview yet, but I’m kind of terrified of them tbh. I do get emails from company’s like Synergystic, but it seems kind of scammy and maybe more of a last ditch effort kind of deal.

So I guess my questions boils down to this: is my plan… good? Am I going about this the wrong way? I look at the requirements for entry level jobs and I feel so unprepared from university. And I also know the job market is less than ideal at the moment (to put it lightly). I’m trying to not be too disheartened, as I’ve read about people on here who took 6-18 months to get a job post university, but it still feels like I was thrown into the deep end after just learning to swim.

\---

I'm in third-year CS taking a course about modern software engineering.

I feel like I'm spending 90% of my time in meetings and writing notes, goals, retrospectives, all this stuff related to Scrum. I think it's a meaningless waste of time. I'm not engineering anything.

We were taught the purpose of Scrum: develop the application so that it can be deployed as a product at any checkpoint. To me that's just a different way of saying ""rush developers to squeeze the most out of a product with the little time that they have so that the company can make as much profit as soon as possible.""

Articles about developer burnout and wasteful meetings only affirm my beliefs. I get that the world operates on working products, businesses want to optimize and eliminate problems. That's always been the case. I want to work for a company where I have the time and space to be creative, to think about different approaches, backtrack and redesign. I want time to brainstorm with my coworkers without rushing to complete something just because we said we would two weeks ago. I want breathing space, I want the time needed to craft a product with thought and care.

On the other hand there are other days where when I finished my tasks I have nothing to do and I feel like I’m just staring at my screen or reading internal wikis for hours. My team does a careful job of assigning me easy tickets (basically grunt work to them because they know the process) that let me figure out the system, so it’s either I get it quickly and have nothing to do afterwards, or I don’t and I ask for help. And when I’m done and ask for more stuff it’s usually too difficult and I need guidance/to bother someone about it.


I have guilty if I just don’t do anything for most of the day. Sometimes like I have a single task left and my teammate has to walk me through it (specific procedure) and I have literally nothing to do until they’re free 2 hours later. At the same time my team and company always seem very busy. Even though WLB at my company and team is constantly praised by the employees I still feel bad if I don’t have like 8 or so hours of screen time even if I don’t do much. Like my teammates will tell each other to take breaks or stop working so hard (in a genuine way) but they themselves will be quite busy. And I’m sort of the opposite.

The work culture is awesome and I really like my coworkers, although I work remotely. I don't have a degree, and this experience has been paramount to my career thus far.

My dilemma comes from a recruiter on LinkedIn who has a remote position offering that fits great with my experience. I don't know too much about the company thus far (I recognized the name when he mentioned it, but that's the extent), but I see my resume fits about half of what they want which I see as enough to apply (not to mention a recruiter referral).

As far as salary goes, I currently make just over $50k, and the position offers $90k.

My current company has done so much for me in terms of growth, and there's much more to come. I received a raise recently as well, so I feel like leaving would be a big slap in the face. On the other hand, nearly doubling my salary and moving upwards sounds really enticing.

235,"Considering getting into this field, I have a couple questions/misconceptions I’d like to get cleared up",11sa7e3,"I’m 19, at 18 years old I moved to nashville to pursue a music career. Music is a huge part of my life and I seriously could not live without it. However, in the music business it’s extremely hard to make even a livable wage. The sky is the limit but it’s so hard to get there and I’m kind of tired of going to bed every night wondering how I’ll be able to pay my rent and even eat. The money is jus weird in general and I might make 5 grand in a month or 0. There’s just no financial security for me and it’s stressful. Nashville is also really expensive. 

So I started looking on indeed for some steadier income jobs related to music. And a lot of the things I saw had to do with audio related programming for video game companies.

I had a friend of mine who dabbles in this stuff show me how he coded a website and I found it really interesting. 

So these two things have really made me consider getting into it. I love music but I also love not being stressed out so if I could have a career in this, and do music when I have time that would be ideal. 

So here’s the questions:

Is the pay really as good as I see on places like indeed, and videos? (Usually between 100-200 grand in salary is what I’m told). I’m under the impression that starting out you can make 50-90 grand depending on the company and you can quickly work your way up. 

What does the average week look like? Is it 9-5 M-F? Like I said I’d still like to have a little time for music. And work towards that at least a LITTLE bit because at any moment it can blow up. And what does the title “software dev” entail as your day to day “activities” at work? 

Is this industry more “one-off” gigs or is there security in a company? 

The music industry as well as most other industries have moved away from requiring a degree from a university, is that a safe assumption for this as well? (Obviously there are outlier companies but I’m talking as a whole)

If so, a coding boot camp seems like the way to go, so what are some credible camps that I should look into? 

What are the chances of landing a good paying secure job right out of a camp? I see alot them advertised that you don’t pay tuition until you get a job but I’m a little skeptical of that. 

These are my questions, and if y’all have any other things that I should consider please let me know

Working with analog gear in the music industry, I’m pretty damn good at problem solving in high stress environments. 

At the end of the day I just want to provide financial security for myself and my family, and at face value this line of work seems to be that thing. And this stuff actually interests me.

I swear it’s making me more productive overall than if I was forced to log on that one extra day. Not to mention the wonders it did to my mental health.

When I was joining my current employer I was in quite a strong negotiating position because of a tricky embedded dev hiring landscape and already having another offer, so they agreed on a 4 day week contract with a 80% pay. It’s the kind of thing I see myself really struggle to give up, so they’ve probably bought themselves a higher likelihood of employee retention.

That said, the working culture is changing and I feel like more and more employers might be open to non-standard working arrangements.

I showed up to the office late by over half an hour (despite living across the street from my office I am late more than not) I arrived to find my boss' boss taking up the seat next to mine. The first half of the day I was met with awkward silence every time our eyes met. After the third time this happened, I figured he noticed I was late and I figured I upset him.

I thought I'd break the silence by taking to him about an email he sent out this morning. He had made some last minute requirements to some work my team was doing. I thought I'd show him what I've been working on and get his feedback on it.

He had a lot of criticisms  & asked several questions I didn't know how to answer. The entire time I was talking to him I had the subtle feeling that my coworkers near by were upset by the discussion they were hearing.

After speaking to my boss' boss I PM'd one of my team members.

TLDR:

* Lay off 10,000 employees and close 5,000 open roles.

* The changes will happen over the next few months, with the majority of them occurring in late April.

* A plan to flatten the organization by increasing the number of direct reports, while still keeping it below 10.

* Lower priority projects across the organization will be discontinued.

* Emphasis on RTO. 

This time around, the changes will primarily affect managers at the M0-2 level, and so on.

From Zuck:

>	Here’s the timeline you should expect: over the next couple of months, org leaders will announce restructuring plans focused on flattening our orgs, canceling lower priority projects, and reducing our hiring rates. With less hiring, I’ve made the difficult decision to further reduce the size of our recruiting team. We will let recruiting team members know tomorrow whether they’re impacted. We expect to announce restructurings and layoffs in our tech groups in late April, and then our business groups in late May. In a small number of cases, it may take through the end of the year to complete these changes. Our timelines for international teams will also look different, and local leaders will follow up with more details.

I've been caught in a bit of a limbo. I'm a contractor that didn't really know much out of college about the difference between different CS positions. After a little over a year, I was let go by my last client, and have been unable to land a new one, since it was the only local option, and external factors prevent me from relocating at this moment.

I've been getting paid to do absolutely nothing for several months, and I'm not naive enough to think my company will put up with this indefinitely. I've yet to reach that magical 2 years experience, and what experience I do have isn't applicable to dev positions, which is where I eventually want to wind up, even if it's not immediately achievable.

I need to do something, if only to minimize the damage if I am let go, but don't have the vaguest idea what.

&#x200B;

For reference, I'm a college freshman probably graduating in 2026. Currently, GPT4 is out and it can take in \~8192 tokens (much bigger input size) allowing it to take in documentation or advanced and really elaborate queries to make it write much better code than ChatGPT used to a few days ago. This means that if your specification is elaborate enough, it can actually write decent code. Now obviously it can only write code based on its data (whether it be the data OpenAI fed it or the query itself) so it can't do anything it does not have information about but isn't this exactly what junior engineers do anyway? 

&#x200B;

Obviously, AI is only going to get better from here, and if GPT4 is already not that far off from being equal to a junior engineer then by the time I graduate won't it be very possible that it becomes equal or better than most junior engineers? Obviously, this will not eliminate junior engineers because companies will still need future senior engineers but wouldn't this make their demand severely decrease and increase the competition even further?

The ""non-technical"" management doesn't understand the difference between building a feature like ""make this button blue"" and ""create a whole ass framework"", and I'm really getting pressured into working overtime (unpaid) to deliver it because a framework takes much more time than the non-technical management estimated.

258,Received an offer from a ~50 person tech startup in NorCal. What are non-obvious questions I should be asking the recruiter about the offer?,11rghst,"15 YOE and I received an offer for a tech startup that has \~50 employees and recently got a Series A.I'm being hired as a ""Software Manager"" which will be the first time I'll be in this role full time.  I previously had this role in addition to an IC role that was wrapped into the title of ""Team Lead"".

I've never worked for a company this small nor have I worked for a company where I had the chance to acquire stock.  I feel like I'm in a position where I do not l know what I don't know and looking for some advice.   If there is a better place to post then please let me know.

I have the chance to acquire ""options"", which if I understand correctly from googling around is basically the right to purchase stock at some price in the future.  This is different than RSUs which is what a company like Google would offer.  The options have the stipulation of a ""1 year cliff, 5-year vesting"".  Is this pretty standard?

Pretty much the options are worthless in my mind.  It's basically a lottery ticket, but salary is double than what I'm getting now which is why I'm considering this.  Granted I currently live north of Boston, MA and I would have to relocated before the end of the year to NorCal to work in a hybrid office.  This is a robotics company working with an embedded team, so it's not unreasonable.

The company actually gave me 2 offers to consider with varying amount of options and base pay. I'm not sure if I should read in to this as to how much they think their options are worth today.  The 2 offers are the follow with a ""1 year cliff, 5-year vesting"".

    Salary:  $210K
    Options: 19,000
    
    Salary:  $220K
    Options: 9,500

A question I already have is how much would I have to pay for the options since that was not listed.  I think this is called a strike price, if I googled correctly.

Should I care about the number of outstanding options there are out there?  Does the percent that represent the 19K they are offering me matter?

I previously asked about the Silicon Valley Bank issue and while they had their money there they assured me that they have access to it and is in process of moving to a new bank.  I feel like I should be asking more questions around this, but I'm not sure what I what would be good to know.

I already have questions about relocation assistance, signing bonus, health care plans, 401K plans, and so forth.  Is it unreasonable to expect to see the details of the various plans vs the name of the plan?

I'm sure there are tons more question I don't even know I should care about.  Thanks for any suggestions!

=====================================================================

Edit:

People are asking the same questions over and over again that I already got answers to.  So I'm just going to post them here.

This post was mainly looking for questions about the stock and business side as it is a series A startup.  I've vetted the cultural and engineering side to my satisfaction and have asked all the basic and non-basic questions.

&#x200B;

Q: What does the runway look like / what kind of funding does <company> have and looking to acquire in the future

A: We are currently going through our series A funding and have a runway that carries us at least through the end of the year. When we consider runway we always like to have a plan A, B, C, etc. that we can shift to based on how fundraising is looking which is why I say at least through the end of the year. The series A round we are currently going through is to carry us through launching our first production units and covers the next few years.

&#x200B;

Q: How do you see the company growing in the short and long term?

A: We are slowly ramping up our hiring (in conjunction with our funding round) to be able to staff what we need to complete our first production satellites that enable our first phase of service to users. This will roughly double the size of the Engineering team in the next year. Longer term, it depends a bit on what ends up coming into scope in the product roadmap which is still an evolving plan beyond our first phase of service – some options only require very little additional growth, while other options will require more growth.

&#x200B;

Q: Who are <company's> competitors and how are you better positioned than them?

A: <company I never heard of> and a few others but no one has launched anything yet. We have patents for our core technology which also helps give us a better position over/against competitors.

&#x200B;

Q: Where have engineers at <company> worked in the past?

A: I like to say “the whos who of <industry> including both new <industry> (SpaceX) and old <industry> (Maxar/Lockheed)” and “from our customer segment (e.g. Ford and Waymo)”

259,Internship Dilemma - College Freshman,11si2ug,"Hello, I am a first-year cs major and I am trying to decide what my strategy should be for internships. I feel pressured because I hear that internships make studying cs at uni worth it. At the moment my only skills are python and java. So I have a long way to go in terms of learning. Is it best for me to try to have a basic understanding of numerous skills in order to stack up a bunch of internships before graduating? Or should I focus on perfecting a set of skills and only try for internships where I could see myself working at that company or field?  


One of my professors recommended I take the second route while a lot of students I see usually follow the first approach. I am conflicted because I am not 100% certain what career I would like to pursue but I would like to keep as many doors open as possible.

260,Is it normal to be split between two teams if you work at a big tech?,11sc29z,"I have been in my main team for over a year. About a couple of months ago, my new manager (the old one got assigned to a different project) asked me if I wanted to work on some other projects, in a sister team. It wasn’t really a suggestion, more of a “go do it”.  I only have 2 YOE, and with the recent layoffs, I was hesitant to argue with him. My company is known for giving managers a lot of power. And I also thought that the work on my main team would wind down a bit, so I would be able to maintain my wlb, while being split between the two teams.

However, the last couple of weeks have changed my perception. Turns out my original team had more work planned for me, and my new team expects me to deliver my work in the next couple of months. It seems that they are softly pushing me to put in more hours, by imposing more aggressive deadlines on me.

261,Recently unemployed dev. Need advice on learning roadmap for my next job,11s58bq,"I'm a self-taught novice/intermediate developer. I'm unemployed now, but my last job was pretty much an introduction to full-stack web development.

The focus of my job was breadth across the front and backends, rather than depth in any one area. I went into the job knowing little to nothing about web development. I learned a lot in my time there, but I don't feel like I truly became competent, or close to competent, in any one part of web development.

I've thought hard about what I need to do to land my next job, hopefully in web development, as that's the domain I've gotten professional experience in over the past year. I want to leverage that experience.

I have three avenues I believe I can travel over the next several months in terms of my learning, and would love people's feedback on them.

**Option 1: The Odin Project**

Focus all my attention on the [Odin Project, full-stack JavaScript curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript?). My web development fundamentals definitely need work and polishing, and I think this project will give me that.

**Option 2: Data Structures and Algorithms and LeetCode**

I have very little training/practice with data structures and algorithms. Seeing as how so many companies require leetcode-style tests as part of the interview process, doing this feels necessary. I would take a course on data structures and algorithms, then immediately jump into practicing LeetCode.

I'm not sure which is more important though... having solid web development skills as stated in Option 1, or having solid LeetCoding skills. I can only study one or the other (see more on this in option 3).

**Option 3: Both 1 and 2**

Do both options 1 and 2 at the same time. If time and resources weren't a consideration, I would choose this option. But my time and resources are limited, so this doesn't seem like the best option. Then again, maybe it's doable. I don't know and ideas on this are appreciated.",ShylotheCurious,13,6,0.87

264,Rejected after 3 rounds. In need of guidance and advice as to how to improve as a better candidate,11saeax,"Apologies in advanced as this is a common request here in this sub.

I recently went through 3 rounds of interviews for a data analyst position, with the last two rounds being 2 hours each and the last one being in person. None of these interviews were coding interviews, just questions about personality, experience, and previous projects. Each interview I feel like I did better than before, but I ultimately got rejected. I was mentally devastated as I thought I was so close. 

I am a new grad (Fall 2022) that has been applying to jobs since October 2022. There were times I was close to getting one, but I couldn't work full time due to me being in school. I have applied to closer to 200 positions. Majority have ghosted me or rejected me. This isn't me not leetcoding as only 2 of the interviews I've had have had me code. 

Here's what I've observed had me a less than stellar candidate:

1.) No security clearance. Several entry level jobs where i fit the criteria require clearance 

2.) Little experience. I have less than a year (4 months) experience in the tech field as a Cyber Security Engineer intern. 

3.) Unfamiliarity with common languages, technologies, and frameworks.  I know about as much as I was taught in university, so I don't even know common programming languages like Java or c#.

There's probably more but I don't what they are. I can understand how number 3 can be fixed, but in what manner? I don't want to have to teach myself another language or technology, but it looks like the only way. But what should I learn? What would give me the best opportunity to get considered or even hired?

In September 2020, I started a job as a contractor in Boston. My title was 'Associate Engineer' but I was dealing with Data Science/Machine Learning in my job. I was paid $36.5/hour and I didn't have any PTO, stock, bonus, and I was paying half of my health insurance.

I'd had some previous experience going in and even though I was apprehensive in the first few days, it turns out that the technical challenge hasn't been the problem but the co-worker who wrote a lot of the source code of the application I have to rewrite. He's not a software engineer at all but did well in that he learned to program on the side and built out the development application using jupyter notebooks for this department while they had nobody else before I joined. Sadly, that's the end of the positive. I was hired to make it production-ready.

Turns out, this guy had been mandated as my supervisor (like from day 1) even though he knows far less than me about software engineering. The problem is he has been making life a hassle for me due to just being jealous that I've been getting the work done well and quickly without a fuss. I've shown him respect but he is deeply insecure and none of that is my making. I really tried to make it work and get him on board but he is waiting for me to fail on something.

When it was implied that he has a supervisory role for the first time today after I brought up an issue I had experienced with said person, I told the boss that a supervisor needs to know more than the supervisee and it didn't go down well.

283,Mid-Career Change... Overseas,11rwdag,"I'm 33, have my bachelor's in Industrial engineering from Missouri S&T, and for 10 years have been doing lots of mechanical design and modelling and simulation, along with lots of industrial engineering/quality stuff. Have worked for Ford, Harley-Davidson, Hitachi, and others. 

Not quite 2 years ago, I got married to a girl from Spain, and due to the circumstances, we have been living in Spain since July 2021. When I moved, I knew zero Spanish and only had my passport and American marriage license. I now have a decent conversational and technical level of the language and have all my paperwork in order and am on my way to becoming a USA-Spain dual citizen.

Job market here is notoriously bad. I took the first even-sort-of-technical job I could find, which saw me being a waterjet machine technician, travelling Europe maintaining and repairing waterjets for a 25,000€ salary. After a year of that, I had a decent level of technical Spanish (driving a car with another tech that is native for 8 hours a day will do that) so I jumped to an engineering job working for a solar panel systems company. I am earning a 35,000€ salary here, which is considered very good.

Generally, I find engineering miserable, even moreso when you earn 1/3 of what you are used to and the Spanish office culture grinds you down. I did a deep dive into my university memories about ""which classes did I actually enjoy most?"" and the answer was programming. My C++ classes were my favorite, but it never occurred to me that I could change course and go with Comp Sci (I was a first-gen college student, I made lots of mistakes).

My goal now is to find a fully remote developer (or similar) position that would allow me to work from either the USA or Spain, and the salary is not super important. Obviously, landing a USA-based gig with USA pay would be amazing, but I'm a simple man.

Another twist: A few weeks ago we found out my wife is pregnant. Accidental. So the ability to work from home would be double fantastic if I could change diapers between coding sessions.

Right now, I am learning Python and have Javascript next on the list, so I can work toward knowing a full stack. 

I just want to know from others who have had similar career changes or situations, am I headed in the right direction? Am I working on a solid stack? What advice would you give and what do you wish you knew before pivoting?",gremlinguy,0,4,0.83
284,I'm a new junior developer and suddenly the only developer!,11r5rz7,"I was hired a few months ago at a small company to join two other junior/mid developers as a late career change. The lead developer had just left and they were working on hiring a new one.   

Flash forward to today and we still haven't found a lead developer, and the other two developers have left, leaving just me to support our existing customers, develop new code and fix bugs/answer support tickets as they come in, and onboard another Jr developer. There's already customer impact as problems arise in more technically complex areas of the code where I risk doing more damage than good. Even in areas where I'm capable of developing a fix, I have no one for code review, best practices, etc. Basically flying blind.  

I'm new to the industry so I guess what's the move? I know I'm pretty lucky to have landed a junior role, so just suck it up, learn what I can, and continually remind my managers that this isn't sustainable and will impact customer satisfaction?

I am employed. I've been on a job hunt since a little after the new year, but I've been somewhat picky and not really in a rush.

About a month ago, I started interviewing at Company A. I've done 3 interviews with people of varying levels of seniority, and most recently I've completed a small take home assignment I was given. All direct communication has been with a person from the company's HR department (scheduling interviews, etc). I would LOVE to work for Company A.

About a week and a half ago, I started interviewing with Company B. I think it would be a fine place to work, and have no reason to be concerned about the work environment or people I'm working with. Company B gave me a verbal offer on Monday, and were happy to give me a week to make my decision. 

After receiving this offer, I reached out to Company A to let them know I had an offer at another company, and I have a week to make a decision. I didn't mention any details aside from that, and simply asked if the team at Company A would be able to get a decision to me in this timeframe. This email was sent to the HR person I had been in communication with, the same day I submitted the take home assignment I mentioned.

I'm getting a little stressed with the clock ticking and not having heard back from Company A. I understand that sort of decision does not rest on the HR employee I've been communicating with, and I would assume they want to review the assignment I submitted.

With the very few opportunities available, I did fairly good in my interview process and was lucky enough to get an offer from two well known companies. I plan to be a Software Engineer and would love to pursue an internship opportunity that will prepare me for this role, however I have a counter offer which will make almost twice as much as a Data Analyst. I am having trouble deciding which offer to accept so my question is would I be better off taking on a position I don't have any interest in pursuing a career in and making more money or sticking to my career path and making less. Lets break down my two offers:

Offer 1: This offer is a Data Analyst Intern position for a very big Bank. I have been told that I will have the opportunity to work alongside the Tech team and we will be collecting data to train an AI. I am very interested in AI and the role sounds more like a Data Scientist/Engineer than an Analyst so I feel like I could just put that I was a Data Engineer on my resume. They are offering me around $40/hour. The only things really keeping me from choosing this position are the title of the role and the location. I plan to be a Software Engineer in the future and would love to have an experience that will prepare me for internships next Summer, and a Software Engineer title to put on my resume.

Offer 2: This offer if a Software Engineer Intern position for a less known Tech company. In this role I would be working alongside people who are Software Engineers and working on a Summer-long project specific to Software. The location of this internship is perfect and I believe I will get much more experience in the field I am interested in. The only downside is they are only offering me $22/hour compared to the $40/hour for the other position.

Which position will set me up better for my future? Will taking the Data Analyst role and having that on my resume hurt my chances at getting a better Software Engineering role next Summer? I am torn between the two options and can't decide.",Brilliant_Maximum328,4,0,0.33

While I've been as open as possible when i was looking for a part-time, since the kind of job doesn't matter too much to me as long as it allows me to keep studying, it would be nice if it was something tech related, as i can get some experience under the belt and an idea of what it's actually like to work in this field 

 The problem I'm facing is that all of these entry positions are usually full time and require being proficient in 5+ coding languages with 2+ other languages added in where they dont ask proficiency but expect you to still be able to read/modify code in.

While I like the courses we've studied, most of the classes we've had so far are pure math and logic, the only coding language we've actually studied is java, with some touches of SQL and Lisp (though I have been studying python on the side, and i think i can code in both java and python with the same proficiency).

I've been mostly looking through Indeed, and I live in Italy.

My questions are:

\-  is this considered normal for those kind of positions? 

\- am I looking in the wrong place?

This company exclusively contracts for the government and works with various agencies. The first round is with the CEO and his ~~wife~~ HR manager.

Once introductions are done he starts talking about the training regimen I will be receiving from him and the various team members. I will be highly trained to wear multiple hats unlike the monkeys out there in big tech corps. Yea dude called developers at big corps monkeys. He elaborated by saying big corp devs only work on miniscule portions of the codebase with limited scope.

Dude then proceeded to gush on and on about his excellent bs detector, how he can sniff bs from a mile away so no one dares to cross him.

Next, he asked if I smoke (WTF). I asked if he is referring to smoke breaks, he said yea, but more importantly in meetings the smell of cigarettes is a no go (I guess smokers can't work office jobs then by his logic). Next he proceeded to school me on dress code, like how the data centers kick people out for not wearing business formal so employees should always turn up in suit and tie when trips to data centers are required.

Afterwards I was told I cannot be actively developing public facing side projects because whatever tech I'm trained on by this company is used for ultra top secret government projects. By that logic I cannot have public ReactJS projects on GitHub lol.

I was then grilled on whether I have any criminal convictions, bankruptcies or whatever because government.

Tbh the entire interview was weird and uncomfortable. This CEO also uses the word ""shit"" very liberally. Each time I answer something he would try to one up me. His ~~wife~~ HR manager would always interject with stupid questions for some reason.

320,"Number of CS field graduates breaks 100k in 2021, almost 1.5x the number from 4 years prior",11qmy69,"These numbers are for the US. Each year the Department of Education publishes the number of degrees conferred in various fields, including the field of ""computer and information sciences"". This category contains more majors than pure CS (the full list is [here](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&cipid=88073)), but it's probable that most students are pursuing a computer science related career.

The numbers for the 2020-2021 school year recently came out and here's some stats: 

* The number of [bachelor's](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_322.10.asp) degrees awarded in this field was 104,874 in 2021, an increase of 8% from 2020, 47% from 2017, and 143% from 2011.

* 22% of bachelor's degrees in the field went to women, which is the highest percentage since just after the dot com burst (the peak percentage was 37.1% in 1984). 

* The number of [master's](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_323.10.asp) degrees awarded was 54,174, up 5% from '20 and 16% from '17. The number of [PhDs](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_324.10.asp) awarded was 2,572, up 6.5% from '20 and 30% from '17. 25% of PhDs went to women.

* The number of bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering decreased slightly (-1.8% from 2020), possibly because students are veering to computer science or because the pandemic interrupted their degrees.

Here's a couple graphs:

* [Stacked bar graph of BS and MS degrees 2001-2021](https://imgur.com/dcDxD0K)

* [Line graph of BS degrees from 1995-2021](https://imgur.com/h8m5Mol)

These numbers don't mean much overall but I thought the growth rate was interesting enough to share. From 2015-2021, the y/y growth rate has averaged 9.6% per year (range of 7.8%-11.5%). This doesn't include minors or graduates in majors like math who intend to pursue software.

Entry level appears increasingly difficult and new grads probably can't even trust the job advice they received as freshmen.  Of course, other fields are even harder to break into and people still do it every year.

Mid level and above are probably protected the bottleneck that is the lack of entry level jobs. Master's degrees will probably be increasingly common for US college graduates as a substitute for entry level experience.",acctexe,471,884,0.96

Other potentially transferable experience would be working in an Agile environment.  A CS degree is not required for the job, and most of the people in the role have an IT degree or an Information Science degree to give an explanation of the actual amount of CompSci expertise they were looking for.

Due to life events/trying to get through school in a shorter amount of time, I took summer classes instead of taking an internship during college (a mistake I know), and I know this is one of the reasons it is so difficult for me to find a job.

I was only able to find a few people who went into software engineering after holding my position on LinkedIn, and they either had a Masters in IT prior to taking this job or a prior SWE internship.

2- data science (similar to software development but replaces some of the webdev classes with stuff about big data, data mining, and statistics).

3- Intelligent systems (has an expert systems class, virtual reality.. Etc)

4- Machine learning (replaces some of the mentioned with deep learning, big data, internet of things..)

5- systems and networks (I've always been interested in systems and low level programming, but I am not a fan of the nature of must jobs involving networks).



I know many people argue that these specialisations are not important when you graduate, and an internship is much more useful but I am trying to work with what I have and I feel like the type of classes that I take even if they won't prepare me for a career, at least they would push me toward a general direction.

A bit of background: I'm 35yo, I've been working in Video Game QA for the past 14 years, climbed the ladder, promotions, yada-yada... and I want to leave. I just can't anymore, and the road ahead looks somehow promising, but not something I want to do for the rest of my life.

Navigating the internet, I started digging a bit about coding, web dev, software dev, full stack, and started a crash course on YouTube for the basics of HTML/CSS. I really enjoyed it. Did the whole 7 hours in 3 days.

I researched a bit and found out about Odin Project (not for me right now) and a Javascript course from Udemy with Jonas Schmedtmann. I'm really enjoying it so far, and I just finished the module about functions (yay me).
After this, I'm planning on jumping into (possibly) React, and I have no idea what next (CS50?).

The question is... is it a doable path for me, not on my 20s anymore, to be able to shift to this career?

Did anybody here change from a non-related field/no coding xp to land a decent job and climb the ladder?

How did you do it? Straight to what you wanted to do, or started as front end, then software dev... is there a recommended path to follow?

TLDR: Went from full stack developer to gloried CRM manager. I'm looking for experiences similar to this and how it effected your career, how you represented it on your resume, etc.

My background:

1. Bachelors of Computer Science 3.5 GPA & a Bachelors of Psychology
2. 1+ year of experience as a full stack developer with a small start up. React/Typescript/Python/Postgresql/GCP/Docker. Company was sad to see me go and the founder and my manager both stated they would definitely give me positive referral.
3. 8+ years of management experience (not in code)
4. Decent amount of side projects using other languages

I recently got a new job as a ""Database Developer"". I applied to be a full stack engineer at the company and got to the interview portion. I heard I wasn't chosen and thought that was that.

I get an email from someone at the company wanting to talk over the phone. They were very long winded explaining their opinions on a lot of tangential things, as well as the direction for their department, mentioning things like spinning up new repos. They ask about my experience with databases but eventually got to the point of offering me a job with them for a different position. Said I didn't get the job I applied for but that I would be a good fit for this role given my experience.

In the offer letter the pay was 150% more than what my previous job was paying me, closer to where I live, and some better benefits in terms of 401k.

I finally start, and I come to find out I'm a glorified CRM manager. I'm managing their app in Quickbase. I don't think I'm going to be writing any code for this job, and can't help but feel like this is going to be black mark on resume.

The work environment also doesn't seem like a place where I would grow much, even if I was writing code for them. They seem very disorganized in terms of roles. No one seems to know what anyone else does and apparently the turnover rate for many of the positions is high.

My previous job stated the door was still open if I didn't like my new job. I've never done that before and I have my reservations about returning to a job I previously left. I've already started applying to new jobs.

I'm a fresh CS graduate. I worked for a couple of weeks in a company without negotiating my position and salary. The company used to have a fixed structure (starting $8000/mo, increment every \~3mo) which I knew beforehand from seniors and assumed it would the same for my case.

After 4 weeks, I was let know that they're gonna pay weekly basis and it's $2000/wk for external projects (projects that they get from other clients) and $1000/wk for internal projects (their in house softwares).

After expressing that I thought their starting is $8000/mo, they decided, to my delight, to give me $8000 for the 4 weeks I worked (I mostly worked on internal projects) and wants to negotiate the salary for future.

It feels like they are going to ask me to work on internal projects which may also be on weekly contracts (that poses possibility of not having work in some weeks) And it's $4000/mo (assuming I get to work the whole month) which is below the median in my area ($5000/mo). I worked real hard to get into the company and now at a complete loss what to do. Ideally, I would like monthly contracts and $8000/mo. How should I proceed with the negotiation?",lullabyXR,2,0,0.33

COVID then further inflated the tech bubble, and the ""a day in the life of a Meta PM"" girls and ""break into tech"" influencers did the rest. Now, 3 years later, the economic downturn will bring the tech industry to pre-COVID state or below.

The problem is that tech companies like Meta are overstaffed, overinflated, overvalued, inefficient, and have 10 layers of useless middle management. If you want a proof, think about it this way - why does the stock market react so positively to tech layoffs if layoffs usually are a bearish signal?

Unfortunately, Meta has the worst future outlook of the big tech companies. No one except non-tech-savvy people thinks that Metaverse will be the next thing, as proven by the stock price again. The 11,000 + 10,000 employees laid off are a first correction of the COVID overhiring, the new RTO policies are further silent layoffs, and the 5,000 open roles closed will prevent any growth in the near future.

We made a lot of assumptions in our conversation and I am writing this post to hopefully gain some perspective on things :).

My friend and I are both final year computing students in university and recently we were having a conversation about fresh graduate roles. I specialise in Web Development and have a preference for frontend dev. My friend however, has focused much more on the backend side of things in both his internships and university education.

He mentioned that since we are computing students, it might be wiser if we start our careers as Backend Devs since he feels like the barriers of entry are higher for non-computing students. 

Additionally, it’ll be easier for us to hop from Backend Dev to Fullstack/Frontend Dev as compared to Frontend Dev to Fullstack/Backend Dev because you learn much more (“technical”) things that are harder to pick up later in your career such as writing code for business logic, diving into some infrastructure stuff, learning how to set up load balancing properly. 

I was also wondering if it is easier for a Backend Dev to rise to a management role/promote as compared to a Frontend Dev since you might have a better understanding of the business logic.

One thing I've noticed is even though I'm confident in my work, both soft skills and technical skills. 

My issue is speed and focus; my development speed is slow; I've written plenty of code over the years, but I feel my speed has never increased. 

I'll plan and start to code, lose my train of thought, reread my code to remember what I was doing, lose it again, double/triple/quadruple reread the same code before I move on to the next part I want to write. This cycle slows down my coding considerably 3-10x sometimes, depending on how often/easily I'm losing it.

Subjectively speaking, tickets that should take me less than a day can take up to three, and tickets that should take me three days can take up to a week. 

I know because I've had weeks (few and far between) when I'm hit with a flow state of hyperfocus and speed where I can finish so much work I make my normal self look incompetent. I haven't figured out how to replicate it on demand.

Of late, I have been very intrigued by low latency programming and would like to explore the field in depth and maybe work in this field.

But, I have very recently graduated from uni and my day to day work is nowhere close to those things.

How should I go about learning more about it ? I understand that blogs and YouTube videos of conference talks can be a good way to start but I think(and correct me if i am wrong) there is no resource that provides a structured way to learn them(basically what to learn after what and so on) and also getting hands on experience is difficult as I definitely don't have the infrastructure on my personal pc.

Some posts by people working in this field tell that you learn while you work on these things. But doesn't that create a situation that you can't work in this industry without knowing about it and you can't know about it without working in this industry?

363,Switching tech stack as a backend dev,11r2tdp,"I've been working with Java for 2 years and at this point I'd like to try something more modern. I never really liked Java and haven't grown to appreciate it these 2 years, but other than the tech stack it was a nice job and I was gaining experience so I didn't want to switch. Before that I worked about 3 years part time as a student, but mostly on embedded applications so it's not very relevant experience.

The issue I'm having is that I'm just getting rejected right away from any job I apply to and I'm not sure why. My guess is that my CV technically doesn't match the requirements because technically I can't say I have X years of experience in Golang or Rust or whatever, even though any developer could tell you it really doesn't take much time to adjust to a new language. I'm eager and willing to learn and I try to show that whenever I can, in my CV, in any ""Tell us about yourself"" question etc. I can understand that companies want relevant experience, but I don't understand why I'm not at least given a coding test to assess my skills.

It has to be said that I'm not searching in my current area because I'm planning to move abroad, within the EU, idk how much of a factor this is. Based on my research, I think I've been giving completely reasonable salary expectations for the area I want to move to as well.

I guess I'm probably not alone with this, so can you guys give any tips for what I might do better in this situation? Even just getting an interview would be great at this point.

364,Toxic insecure non-programmer at my neck: how to deal with him once and for all?,11rdjx6,"Hey all. I started in a junior role recently as the sole programmer. I was brought in to rewrite a legacy application that's disorderly and where the code was mostly written by a mechanical engineer who did it part-time. His code is unreadable. He had been pushing reams of comments and notes to himself like educational links, with no overall organisation and no comments on the code itself. It's some of the worst written code I've ever seen, magic numbers, everything you can imagine. I've come in and I've been doing really well. Meeting task deadlines set by myself in tandem with our boss, and I have a hold on the entire project and its architecture.

Sadly this mechanical engineer is playing up. I was nothing but polite to him since I started, I even gave a bit of praise where I could to build a rapport, but he has this gigantic ego and is incredibly insecure on top. He thinks his code is the best thing since sliced bread.

Now he is getting involved in my work as if he is my supervisor or boss or something. When I accomplished the task he had not been able to do before I joined, he kept gnawing at me trying to catch me out on my solution. I answered all of his questions with confidence and correctly and I had the working solution to back up why it had worked - like why these technologies and so on.

Then today I kinda needed his help about a domain related thing and he basically told me to look it up. It was literally a domain question that he could have answered off the top of his head, it was looking for a selection of something. I super rarely asked him anything since starting since he is so bad at explaining, but even this request to give me a simple list of things he would not do without patronising me. He is looking for chances to undermine me whenever he can. And I mainly asked him in an attempt to build rapport with him on his home turf and to set the stage for our future interactions. There are a few other examples of him trying to undermine me.

So far how I've dealt with him:

When he got involved in the task he failed to do, by trying to tell me what to do when I had already done that thing, I immediately told him to leave the implementation to me. He didn't get the message and went back and forth on the technical a few times rather than help me with the domain knowledge. Our boss has started to notice it and has tried to nudge this guy to focus on the domain/knowledge side of things.

I will have to work with this guy for this domain specific knowledge though I am limiting that in so far as possible.

What can I do about him? If I'm answering back sharply, nobody else cares. I'm the only programmer and non-member of the core mechanical engineering team. He has also completely unnecessarily and arrogantly mentioned his domain expertise when there was no call for it at all. I am sick of him. HELP!",FormNo,13,0,0.5
365,I am in a difficult situation and I don't know what to do,11q8xd0,"Two years ago, I started freelancing as a fullstack engineer after burning out from working for a startup for two years which, in hindsight, took advantage of me. After realizing the value of the work I'm doing I left and started freelancing, which went really well (I made about 10-15k a month, which is a lot for an EU freelancer). For one of my clients, a young startup, I was developing a complex B2B platform. Business went really well for that startup, and it became my main client, making up most of my monthly income (which of course you should avoid as a freelancer).  8 months in, the approached me with an offer: They wanted me as the CTO of their company (that's now 7 months ago). I really didn't want to work for a failing startup again and avoid repeating the same mistakes, so I clearly stated my demands, which aimed at minimizing the risk of the company failing and me still making a decent salary along the way. The demand was €10,000 salary a month + 10 percent of the company, take it or leave it. As I was already making a lot as a freelancer, and my actual plan back then was to scale my freelance business and hire additional staff, I thought that's a fair deal. I have 7 YoE and am really passionate about my work, don't mind doing over hours, have experience managing teams, and don't mind hopping on a call with a customer at 10PM to fix a problem. I did know that I probably would have to put in a lot more work than previously, work on weekends, and have practically no holidays, but that's all acceptable looking at the possibility of a potential and not so unrealistic exit.

They accepted my offer, we were all happy, celebrated, and started working. From that moment on, I was actually publicly presented as a co-founder everywhere, which is strongly needed when searching for investors (a software startup without a co-founding CTO is not well received as you can imagine).

It was indeed one of the most stressful and challenging times in my life, I am the sole developer building a whole platform used by 120+ enterprise clients, and the number is growing. I didn't take a single day off since then and fully free weekends are rare.

The business is going well, and our CEO is working nearly full time on raising money (until now we bootstrapped).

Today, our CEO calls me, and says our cashflow doesn't look that well, but it's manageable. Thing is, he said to me, it is very difficult for him to justify my high payroll to investors, as I am earning as much as all the other 3 co-founders combined (who hold the rest of the company shares). He argued that investors don't like to see the unequal pay distribution and that it could become a problem, if not \*the deciding factor\*, for receiving investment.

I said to him, I honestly don't know what to respond now, our initial conditions were quite clear and reducing my salary because of investor relations... I don't know, just seems wrong, as I really put so so much effort in this, and after all it's a software company... and I am the only person developing and maintaining the software, and I didn't join as a ""traditional"" co-founder right from the start.

Now I wanted to ask you folks: Am I the asshole here? Do I demand too much? Should I steer in and offer to reduce my salary?

**Note**: From the 10k I make monthly, I directly pay 2k to one of the co-founders, because I bought the 10% from him and I essentially ""pay them off"" this way. So, after taxes, all in all, it's about 4-5k.

This situation really puts a lot of pressure on me currently as I really like the company, the people, the co-founders and the overall product vision. But this makes me really anxious now, and I don't know what to do, as I don't want to be the person who ruins it for everyone.

I'm probably too emotional on this to see things objectively, it feels like I can't see the forest for the trees anymore.

Since we had a lot of talent in our team, at the engineering level, several of my colleagues, including myself, have recently received contacts from other companies to conduct an interview.

I ended up talking to a startup that has an extremely interesting project, and that is currently growing at an overwhelming speed. 

The head of engineering contacted me after former colleagues (from the company that was shut down) he interviewed praised my work, he told me that he would love to have me on his team, and sent me a simple take-home challenge just to check my skills.

Some of my former colleagues will most likely accept the job offer from this startup because they were very satisfied with the approach, and they were assured that the environment was not bureaucratic, and that everyone had ownership over the product

Unlike the startup that I was before, this one has many more seniors, and they dominate the market globally, they basically don't have any competition yet.

What makes me undecided is that, at the moment I only have 3 years of experience and I would like to work in a big company. It's good to work in startups, but it's all very unstable, you never know what might happen in the following day. I was quite happy where I was working and suddenly I became unemployed

1. Computer Engineering might be looked at by employers as a hardware degree even though at my school 75% of it is software. I want to focus on software, so I’m worried I’ll be looked upon negatively when compared to other CS students.

2. I’ve heard that minors don’t actually mean anything significant, so if I ever decide to go into embedded stuff, an employer would rather hire an EE/CmpE.

At this job, I learned that I might have to devote my entire life to software development (eat, sleep, code) if I ever want to be competent in this field.

“I graduated from college with a degree in electrical engineering after which I started my career as an electrical design engineer, mainly focusing on the design and construction of electrical power systems. Although I enjoyed the work, I quickly realized there were a number of day-to-day tasks that could be automated with programming. So I began building custom Python scripts to help automate a few of my tasks, and eventually began building a full suite of internal company software tools that helped increase productivity of the design engineering department I was working in. Eventually my role transitioned from electrical engineer to software engineer in our internal software development department, where I mainly focused on building full stack web applications automate tasks to help with engineering productivity. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time with my current team but feel my career may be better served by working for a product-focused technology company, which is the reason I’ve applied to this role and hope to work with your company in the near future.”

I currently have another job that pays the bill so I am learning development on my own at the moment. I want to switch to freelancing as a dev on the side after some time . 

What makes me reluctant to get a proper software job is that my country only has lots of sweatshop IT talents that I can get into. They pay way less than my current job and I am not sure I can learn much from those places at the pace I want . Most people I have talked at these places want to move to management rather than code. 

My current plan is to complete Odin project nd work on some open source projects, build a portfolio and switch to freelancing. 

Is this enough? Or do I need to have experience at some place to start freelancing? What are your thoughts? I figure these open source projects run like big companies any ways so I might learn better things from there.",Netero1999,2,0,0.14

Simply put, I don’t think industry coding is for me. I do genuinely enjoy programming on my own time, but over the years Ive discovered that I do not like it within the confines of the industry and wanted to start exploring/researching different career paths.

I’d still like to remain in tech and potentially do a bit of programming, I just don’t think a full on software engineering role is the right way forward for me. I’m not looking to transition right at this moment, but I do want to start researching options for the future.

For math, degree won't really make a difference in interviews but the knowledge can be very useful since I'm planning to master in AI and machine learning after completing Bachelor's. But what concerns me is math will consume too much time of mine and I won't be able to participate in possible project. I'm also really into algorithms and wondering if math will contribute to my understandings. But if I won't be able to participate in projects then why learn all that stuff?

For physics, the main reason is I always loved physics and really keen on learning advanced physics. But the problem is same that It will consume too much time, plus won't really make a difference to my cs career. Only benefit is my personal satisfaction which is not enough.

For psychology, I'm only considering this so I'll have enough spare time to develop my cs skills and work on as much as projects with my colleagues.

432,How do I transition to a more developer focused job?,11qlv30,"I joined my current job after I graduated about 2 years ago and at first it seemed like I could get some good developing experience right from the get go. I started to learn how to develop in Java with some parts in Springboot and also learned Selenium for testing. I then transitioned over to working on Tasktop and ever since then I haven't so much as even opened an IDE in months.

I only joined my current job because I wanted experience right out of college and wasn't intending to stay here for a while. I have stayed (so far) because it allowed me to learn other non-technical skills outside of work while I (thought I would) learn software development skills at work.

On paper I ""should"" know how develop in Java working with Selenium, (basic) Springboot, Maven and the like; and while that's kind of true I've never worked on a coding project before. I've only worked on personal projects to help out one/two people or programs that automate manual work I'm doing elsewhere. I have little knowledge on how version control works, never done code reviews, or worked with other developers on a code project before. Management is also pushing me and other developers towards more devops roles over time, since my company isn't mainly software focused.

The only area I know a decent amount about is, is game development since it's the entire reason I got into software in the first place. I took a hard turn away from those jobs after hearing non-stop bad news from that area and ended up where I am now. It's not all bad, it's not stressful and allows me to learn other things, it's just that my location and job type are not what I want to settle in to.

When I look at other jobs I see technologies & languages I don't know or have worked with. I know you don't need a deep knowledge of any of those areas as long as you can transition knowledge between languages/technologies, but I'm worried about my lack of actual development experience. I've done a few code challenges personally to see if I still have some skills and I still remember how to program luckily, so it's not all too bad. I'm just unsure how to go about job searching down the road.

So I guess my question is: how do I transition to a more developer focused job without much developer experience?",thechief120,2,0,0.43

This person is now in a position where he has enough passive income to live comfortably, and can now invest in a career that more aligns with their interests.

473,No Return Offer Post Summer 2022 Internship,11pm9f1,"Hi all! I'm still processing this news as it's still pretty fresh. I interned with a company for essentially 3 summers (started in Fall 2021; ended in Summer 2022). I never received an ounce of negative feedback my entire time there. I was really hoping I'd get an offer after graduation (because how could I not???). 

Last September I receive a survey from the company saying that they were interested in my next steps and I filled it out immediately. It wasn't an automated email but rather sent from a real person who works there (we connect on LinkedIn - he's very nice). I'm thinking, ""ok great! They didn't forget about me! I have a fat chance of walking away with a return offer"". Now, my roommate told me to always have a back-up plan and that I should still look for jobs. I thought to myself, ""nahhhh nothing is going to go wrong. I'll get my offer :)"". I was wrong.

February 2023 rolls around. I email the woman in charge of talent acquisition and inform her I'll be graduating very soon (this May) and am interested in potential full time opportunities. A few days later, I get this heartbreaking email:

""Thank you for reaching out! I hope all has been well.
 
At this time, I’m unfortunately not working on any positions that would be a fit for you. However, please feel free to check out our career’s page and apply to openings that look of interest.
 
Best of luck with your last semester!""

Now, when I first read the email, I was in SHAMBLES, rightfully so, as I was really banking on this job. I was thinking, ""oh dear god WHAT DID I DO WRONG?"", feeling like an absolute failure ( I still do). After re-reading it a few more times, I realized it has nothing to do with my performance explicitly, but rather there are no roles for me straight up! I'm thinking that since I wrapped up my internship last Summer, there hasn't been any entry level SWE roles under this company AT ALL (which makes sense given the market we are in currently). It's crazy because I have not seen any entry level SWE openings on the career's page since I looked last Fall. Now, when I checked the career's page just now, I ONLY see senior SWE roles. Upon doing the whole job search, I'm finding mostly senior level roles which is disheartening. 

It took me a while to realize that the email doesn't say ""you can't EVER work here again!! Don't come back!!"". She said she doesn't have anything for me RIGHT NOW. Which doesn't mean forever. Who knows?? A role could open up in a couple months or even 6 months to a year.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for my internship experience, I think I'll have a leg up on some candidates. However, it would have been a dream to finally make that, ""I'm pleased to announce I'll be an incoming SWE at 'X company' after interning with them"" post on LinkedIn. Because that's what LinkedIn is, you basically jerk yourself off right?

I know it's not the end of the world, but it sure feels like it. It really sucks how this ""recession"" is eating up the tech space. I'm also going to stop looking at my feed on LinkedIn for a while. I love seeing folks land their internship/full-time roles and I'm excited for them! Just a little sad for me, you know? When I was applying for my very first internship role, I made a big a** spreadsheet with like 50 rows on it. Now, I don't even have the motivation/energy to do that. Resisting the feminine urge to crawl into bed and not come out. 

How does someone intern with a Fortune 50 3 times but doesn't land the job?

Anyone else in the same boat as me? Anyone not get a return offer because of this f*cked up market we're in?? Please comment down below.",nybaldwin714,14,11,0.61
474,USA CS salaries are insane!,11otekw,"I always hear people on this sub talk about $70k + starting salaries, as a Brit this seems insane. Most starting salaries in software here are between $25k - $33k (equivalent in £). I see senior jobs advertised as $60k + but that’s with years of experience. 

There is outliers, I see the odd graduate job advertised for $40k - $55k (equivalent in £) but they are few and far between. 

Not sure what the rest of Europe is like but I had no idea how well you guys get paid! 

What is the average starting salary you guys see in whatever country you are from ?

Edit: for those questioning the legitimacy of my claim, [save the student](https://www.savethestudent.org/student-jobs/whats-the-expected-salary-for-your-degree.html#IT) estimates the average starting salary to be £25 k.

475,Some questions about starting a course in full-stack web dev,11q3w2f,"I'm considering doing an [**8-month course**](https://www.hackeru.co.il/course/web-developer) (In Hebrew, but the syllabus is at the end) that **costs 5800$\~**. Yes I know resources online exist but I don't trust myself to stick with it and I need the socialization and guidance, not to mention the place supposedly has a contractual commitment to getting you a job when you pass. So:

&#x200B;

1. **What's the day-to-day like?** What's the work-life balance? How difficult is the job itself (I know there are different jobs, but generally either backend or frontend, at least your experiences)? Honestly I'm kinda worried it's too much for me.
2. **How stressful is it / can it be?** This is huge for me. I'm very worried that this field would be too fast-paced and too much would be expected of me and I'd have to constantly keep up. Right now in life I just want something that pays ok, will get my life actually moving (NEET and stuck for a while now) and won't make me wanna Roblox myself.
3. **What's actually most important to getting hired**, at least as a junior? How hard is it to actually get a job?
4. **How much math is there?** I'm not horrible, but I'd rather not.
5. **Is Python necessary?**
6. **Is part-time work viable** or will I be dismissed offhand if I want that? Financially I'm fine RN.
7. **What's the general vibe, in your experience?** This sorta ties back to 2. I'm just scared of getting myself stuck in a big impersonal corporate constantly online machine, tech screams that to me. Obviously it varies from place to place, but I'm guessing there's a general baseline. How advertising / commercial / corporate is it? I know it's a general question.

477,Which subjects are important in a CS degree?,11qa4fl,"
A bit of a back story, I'm doing a Bachelor of Business (Finance major).   
My previous years and former self were a fog that I want to get out of, I didn't really put much thinking in it when I choose to study business, I also hate it, really hate it. That combined with untreated ADHD made me a very bad student...  


Everything's getting better this year though fortunately, I got diagnosed and started meds, read Atomic Habits 3 times. I'm finally doing better at uni. But unluckily for me the only subject that could made me sit and enjoy and actually eager to learn is Programming.   
It's a basic Programming 1 subject which teaches fundamentals Java and Python (from variables to classes, objects, inheritance). Man I love it... But Finance still gives me yawning episodes but it's a bit better than before. 

I've also started TOP foundation (front-end stuff) and absolutely love it. YES. Finally something I like to do and find really interesting.

So long story short, I changed my study planner from doing Acct + Finance to Finance + Electives.  
I get to study 7 Electives! My Finance major is only 8 subjects, so I basically have the chance to study a major-minor in CS! Although without the official name... :( 

So I'm trying to pick the diamonds, the absolute chads in a CS degree to study, here's my list after researching online:  


Programming 1  
Programming 2  
Database Fundamentals  
Data Structure and Algorithms  
Advanced Algorithms  
Discrete Maths  
Last one - undecided.

I can choose to study basically anything (from OS to CS theory to Web Dev to Data Systems...)

People seem to prefer OS to CS theory here? So I kinda don't know what to do... This is where I need your help, please help... 

I'm also aware of [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) and it is definitely on my list for the future, the guide said itself that if you're not a competent programmer as of this moment, go become one then come back to the guide in a year or two... So I'm planning to do that!

Recruiter hits me up and asks me to fill out a questionnaire with some easy technical and soft-skill questions. I send it and she replies with basically ""congrats you got the job, send your address and well get an offer letter together.

They're about to send a whole home office setup to my house. The offer letter also requires images of my driver's license, so if this is a scam then that would be the endgame for them.

I responded today asking for a video meeting with someone from the dev team or the dev manager, and mentioned my reservations about accepting an offer without having spoken to a person.

I guess my questions are, how common is this? Am I doing the right thing asking for a meeting? Will they rescind the offer because I'm giving them a hard time?

I have been an IT kinda guy since I discovered Linux in the mid 2000s. I never pursued anything tech related though and did my undergraduate in a non CS field. Then in the mid 2010's I really got interested in coding and started learning PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. I build a few applications and by 2018 I was confident enough in my abilities and what I had under my belt to apply for a masters program in the UK, which accepted me thanks to showing my strong self taught CS background and a letter of recommendation from someone that worked with me and the institution I studied at. I completed the course in 2021, and have been trying to break into development on my own, remotely, for over a year. 

My situation is a bit unique. I am an American living abroad (have lived abroad for over a decade) and would like to do development work for EU/NA clients. I've registered and signed up for upwork and have been making bids on projects for over a year with no responses. I've also been continuing to develop my skillset, and have been learning Rust (more because at this point I want to learn something that I want to learn, a whole degree in everything from mobile development, project management, fullstack development, etc, while exciting and educational, hasn't always been what I would choose to learn), and have started working on some applications of my own in Rust, and I'm contemplating beginning to contribute to a couple projects on github. 

**My Goal:**

Short term, I just want to find a part time/freelance work in NA or EU working with technology I know and am confident using, such as PHP+MySQL (regardless of framework. I've tried Laravel and feel pretty comfortable I could get up to speed with it quick. for example). But I am not currently working in development or technology. I'm working in Education and am making a comfortable living with this and would like to do free lance/part time until I have a stronger CV/Resume and portfolio to actually transition to development as a fulltime job. Quitting my job for the next year+ is NOT an option for me now and I really want to gain real world experience

**Problem:**

How do I break into development? I have knowledge, background, and have built some applications for a former employer (server side tools), but I would probably still come in as an entry level programmer based on my lack of developer experience.

499,Are people really just landing jobs with nothing but a degree?,11op96p,"The amount of times I hear ""went back to school for a CS degree, best decision of my life, immediately landed a 200k job before graduating, had better work-life, better wife, better wifi, blah blah blah""

No internships, no projects, just pure degree. This is what 99% of college students are thinking is that just study and graduate with a high GPA and you'll land 6 figures easily, this is the best bachelor's degree, everything is else is trash.

Is this a lie? I'm seeing people with internships struggling to land jobs a year out from graduation after hundreds of applications.

500,Questions on Freelancing,11pdzcj,"Background:
* Completed Software Engineering Immersion Boot-camp about 3 years ago
* Proficient in JavaScript, Python and can finesse Ruby
* Proficient in front-end frameworks such as React.js and back-end frameworks/tools (django, rubyonrails, mongodb)
* Currently working as a Customer Success Engineer for about a year and some change (querying databases, working with APIs)

I'd like to get back to more coding/programming work and improve my skills and eventually land a role as a Solutions Engineer at my company. Additionally, and more importantly, I just need the extra cash so I figured I could start some freelance work on the side. I understand this may be filled with n00b questions, but I'd like to learn the intricacies of freelance work.

1. Which websites/sources can I find freelance work to begin with?
2. How would you recommend building a site for a potential client (i.e. Wordpress/SquareSpace vs building your own project from scratch)
3. What are the pros and cons of the methods listed above?
4. Is either method preferred over the other depending on the ask of the customer?
5. Let's say I did decide to build my own project for a customer. What happens once the project is done? Do I ask them to acquire their own domain? Have them set up their own Heroku or AWS account to host the database I've set up for them? Should I give them access to their project's repo on my github or have them create their own github? I guess I'd like to know how to hand off the project to the customer. (Somebody please let me know lol T-T)
6. If I used Squarespace/Wordpress (FYI: haven't learned them yet), do I have them create their own accounts and then basically just work on their sites there?
7. Are there any tips/pitfalls anyone can share in regards to freelance work?

Again, my apologies if these questions are really entry level. If anyone has any guides or sources I can reference for this kind of thing, it'd be much appreciated!

502,Should I Obtain PM or IT Certifications Given My Background?,11pmc3z,"As a quick outline, I’m looking to transition careers and/or continue obtaining certifications and am looking for advice to the best approach. Input as to where to focus next is highly valued and I want to thank you all in advance for your input on this inquiry.  


Objective: 

To transition from Real Estate Sales into Project Management. I have roughly five years’ of on paper PM experience (over the last ten years) in the small business environment.   


Recent endeavors: 

I obtained PMP® and PMI-ACP® certifications in early March, and I have seen a slight increase in outreach already. I have reached out to multiple recruiting services over the last two weeks and have received basically no follow-ups. Additionally, I’ve applied for roughly 150 jobs over the last two months which I’ve had roughly five over the phone interviews.  


Future possible endeavors: 

Now the question is, do I start applying for positions only, focus on online networking, continue a balance approach of applying for jobs while also obtaining more certifications, or something else?  


My current path: 

Given my situation I’ve narrowed it down to two primary paths which include moderate levels of both job applications and continuing certifications. 

1. PM Path - This seems the simplest from here given that I have one of the highest and most accredited certifications (PMP) you can have in this domain. Continuing certifications, in order of operation, if I wanted to continue down a mastery path would be:

a. Certified Scrum Master (CSM)

b. PMI-RMP® - PMI Risk Management Professional 

c. IASSC Certified Lean Six Sigma Black Belt™ (ICBB™)

The only drawback I see to this approach would be that I may be viewed as overly specific. 

2. Analytics/Software Path - I’ve had a few interviews for PM roles that I’ve been looked over because they want someone who understands specific systems, most commonly SAS, SAP, Salesforce, BlueYonder, MS Project, Xactimate, or insert one of a hundred other applications here. 

While worthwhile, I feel it would be difficult to obtain certifications for specific software packages until I acquire a job with an existing set of systems. Therefore, I thought a good offset for a lack of individual software experience would be to acquire Analytics and IT based certifications. Certifications, in order of operation, if I wanted to continue down this more general path would be:

a. ITIL 4 Foundation > ITIL 4 Managing Professional

b. Google Data Analytics Certificate for introductory phase (not really a certification)

c. Associate Big Data Analyst (ABDA™)  


Conclusion/Advice:

Does being more rounded with generally certifications seem to be a better use of time than mastering the PM approach? Do these seem like good potential certifications to take if the former? Are there certifications out there you would recommend instead? Should I focus on individual software systems instead? Should I focus more on blanketing my resume and work on acquiring a position now? 

Finally, it may also be worthwhile to potentially go back to a brick-and-mortar university for a B.S. Civil Engineering Degree, but I’ve been reluctant to do so given the cost and that I have a M.S. Business Management Degree. I feel I get overlooked a lot because my degrees, while from accredited universities, are not exactly household names. Thoughts on this?   


Education/Certifications/Licenses: 

• M.S. Business Management

• B.S. Business Management

• A.S.S. Construction Engineering

• Technical Certificate of Computer Aided Drafting Technology

• Project Management Institute - Project Management Professional (PMP)

• Project Management Institute - PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)

I am in my early-twenties(22) and currently struggling to find my purpose in life. I often find myself torn between different career paths, unsure of which one to pursue. I am hoping to seek guidance and advice from those who have experienced similar struggles or have insights to share.

On one hand, I am considering learning web development, specifically focusing on html/css/js and if you look on my post history i am doing it currently alongside with job. I am aware that this field is oversaturated at the entry level, but the potential for a high income without a degree is appealing. However, I am also intimidated by the numerous frameworks and libraries which i will have to learn, which can be overwhelming for a beginner. projects made by me are total garbage. Also to be honest i have not any interest in this field and currently learning it only for money.

On another hand, I am also drawn to the growing field of data science. I find math to be intriguing, and this field seems to be expanding rapidly. Pursuing a degree in this field seems like a viable option, but I am afraid about potentially failing at this path and wasting my 20s.

Furthermore, in regards of my current situation I have graduated law, but the legal industry in my country pays poorly so i am concerned about missing opportunities in lucrative field of tech and i constantly tell myself that if you work harder for 2/3 years maybe you will land well paying job. but since middle school i was not friend with numbers and performed terribly in STEM subjects so at least it seems safer path but less rewarding.

At the same time, I desire financial stability and the ability to provide for my family. my dream is too safe up money up to one million. I feel like i am in my turning point right now, feel anxious everyday , concerned that I may make a devastating mistake in choosing the wrong path. I blame myself to be unprincipled, inconsistent stupid, individual.

509,Data Analyst to Data Engineer or continue learning software for new role?,11piq3d,"Hi lovely people. 

I’m a 28 year old senior data analyst who has been in the data analyst career for about 5 years now.

Recently I’ve started a new job at a big company and it’s been about six months. And I think my experience has helped me learn that this field really isn’t for me anymore.

Some things I really enjoy doing is focusing on growth development, coding, problem solving and having the satisfaction of creating/improving something to help meet business requirements effectively.

In my current field and job I found the process of discussing and presenting data and would much rather focus on code and analysis. Of course this is a necessity in every field, and I think I’m good at it. But I would like to do a lot less. I also wish to be in a field that will encourage more working at home and hybrid working opportunities. Frankly I face quite a bit of dread and anxiety because of how much this is expected from me in this field. So much so I can’t seem to sleep properly due to the stress of thinking about work.

Additionally, I found coding only in SQL (which is the primary job 80% of the time) quite limiting and not much avenues for growth.

As such I’ve thought of two paths and wanted to get your opinions
1) I’ve started a course for a front end developer pathway and working through it everyday so I can switch to a new career in the software field asap.
2) I can transition into a data engineer field as I heard that this role would be aligning with what I have learnt so far, but focus more on coding rather than the client facing aspects of data analytics. Even though it’s more sql work I would be interested to hear how it’s different to an analysts work with sql and the tools/processes for a engineer and how much room there is to grow in them.

Hope there’s anyone else that may have followed the same path. But regardless would love to hear your thoughts.

I'm a university student majoring in computer science at a smallish university, in my fourth year of study. I've got one more year of study to go, doing a 4 year degree in five years to give myself a little more room to breathe.

I figure I could probably get like a B- in the course if I try to finish it out, which saves me from needing to take another math course for my math minor but leaves me with a bad mark, or I could withdraw from the course to avoid a bad mark on my transcript but doing so would require me to take another class.

528,Mathematics Graduate Who Needs Advice,11p9rsb,"Hi guys,

I am a soon-to-be college graduate from the midwestern US. I am graduating this May from a top 50 university with a BS in Financial Mathematics and a minor in Computer & Information Science.

Initially, I wanted to gain the skills to become an actuary through my degree, but I've decided instead to aim towards becoming a software engineer, preferably in a role where advanced math is applicable (back-end, AI/ML, game design, data science).

Unfortunately, I did not do well academically throughout my schooling due to a multitude of things, so I'll be graduating with about a 2.3 cumulative GPA.

In addition, I do not have any completed programming projects to showcase to future employers. I do not have a portfolio page for them either. However, I do have a GitHub, and I know roughly how to use it.

Lastly, I do not have any internship or full-time professional experience related to either financial mathematics or computer science at this time.

My coursework related to mathematics included: 
* multivariate calculus, 
* linear algebra, 
* differential equations, 
* probability,
* scientific computing, 
* financial economics, and 
* derivative pricing.

My coursework related to computer science included:
* introduction to programming in Java,
* data structures in Java,
* discrete mathematics,
* data structures & algorithms,
* computer systems, and
* information security.

Given my situation, I am wondering where I should focus my energy in the coming months. My concerns are:
* if you were someone with little academic success (but a STEM degree), no programming projects, no professional experience, but some OOP knowledge with Java, would you apply to jobs or build your portfolio?
* is completing an internship necessary before finding a full-time software development position?
* should I branch out to learn new technologies, such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and build additional projects with those? How far down the Node/React/SQL pipeline should I go?

My thought was to begin The Odin Project to learn to build web applications through the ""Full Stack JavaScript"" track, build and showcase my own projects afterwards, then practice for interviews on LeetCode while applying to jobs, but I'd still be months away after graduation from being hired.

I still need to pay rent. Should I apply for more ""finance-related"" jobs (given my major) and work towards an actual development role with projects, etc. in the meantime?

533,Work announced RTO. I don’t feel comfortable moving into such a high COL area when I feel always on the edge of PIP,11op8vb,"Took a job in September. During work, I noticed that the work culture was _insane_ (10-12 hours a day, always expected to be available). I also felt I constantly, always received negative feedback. It didn’t matter how much I did right or how much I produced. 

I think part of this stems from a very… toxic feeling culture. Everyone seems very on edge, overworked, and really spread thin. The expectations for everyone seemed to be a lot more than just what their job titles implied. The biggest red flag to me was when I told my mentor “I’m really trying but I can only do so much”, and he told me that he understands because he _got in yelling arguments in the office_ with my manager. I thought this might just be hyperbole, until I started seeing people be really rude and aggressive on public calls, singling out individuals 

Anyway, my manager in 1:1s, basically since I started, has implied that I am doing very poorly and am right on the edge of a PIP. He phrased it like “I really don’t want to but you’re close”. Because of this, when my lease expired, I didn’t feel comfortable renting a new place cause I always had an underlying feeling that I was gonna be fired the next day and I moved in with my parents or couch surfed or rented airbnbs. Basically homeless, tbh

Work announced a return to office and now I’m afraid. The places I’ve been staying would be a huge commute to the office, like 2+ hours a day. Places in relative walking/public transit accessible to the office costs 3k minimum. What I’m really afraid of is getting a place, getting fired, and getting stuck with a lease in an ungodly expensive area

This is coupled with the market being pretty poor and many other companies following suit with return to office, but paying less. I have around 10 years experience. I’ve been considering reaching out to my previous job, but I’m not sure what I’d say

I'm writing this post so some people can hopefully guide me in the right direction so I can ensure I do good on my first ever technical interview. After countless companies rejecting me(as I'm sure 99% of you can relate), this is the one I cannot fail. So, the internship I have been going through is f5's cybersecurity apprenticeship found here: [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3501314348](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3501314348) . Based on the job description maybe one can gauge what interview questions should look like.

To add some more context, I asked my recruiter what to expect and she said 'I still have not heard of what they will be testing you on but I know it will be pretty basic. Just to see what you do know about Python and your problem solving skills and how receptive you are to advice and feedback.' I also asked the manager what to expect and he said, 'We are still deciding what coding challenges we plan to use, so I don't have a firm answer yet. But I expect that there will be 2-3 challenges, with the first one easy (a ""warmup"") and subsequent ones will be more difficult. Nothing too crazy though, the questions should be appropriate for a CSC student with 1-3 years of classes.' I also asked him a couple days before this over zoom and he said data structures , min/max/avg, stuff like that. 

I have been doing my best in leetCode questions and trying to learn as much as I can. But it is just so hard to know if I am spending the right time on the right thing. Does anyone here have any sort of insight? What should I practice? Which problems? I have been learning the window sliding technique and two pointers/fast slow pointers stuff right now.

541,Experience moving from EU to US,11oluhl,"I’m a US citizen, went to college and grad school in US but never worked there. I’m currently working in EU (Barcelona) as a mid-level dev making great money (for Spain). From my experience living in the US and EU, what I currently make is very comparable to a 100kish salary in a Big (or even med-big) city in the US. When the difference on salary really kicks in is when moving to senior level. In the US salary bump for senior is insane. Here I could get like 10k more, which will have basically no difference in my lifestyle and ability to save significantly more.

So my plan is to make senior level and then move to US for a senior role. Any tips for anyone who has done this? And if my predictions are right lol.

548,Career shift: from Data Engineer to more general Software Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer? In this economy?!,11ome7i,"**MY STORY SO FAR**:

* Master’s degree in math.
* 7 YOE in roles labeled either ""data scientist"" (DS) or ""data engineer"" (DE). TBH, the DS roles have felt like DE roles (no building of statistical models, more focus on dashboards, SQL, data warehouses). 
* Currently DE at FAANG.  Been at this job since 2021.

**ISSUES AT THE MOMENT**:

* **I find the job uninteresting.** I've never been super passionate about DE work – I got into it because the interviews were easier compared with DS interviews, and the positions were more plentiful. This job is especially boring as it's mostly building dashboards or chasing down DS and SWE partners to instrument logging or figure out what to put in the dashboards.
* **I see limited growth potential at my current company.** I should clarify that I feel fortunate to have this job in the first place, and I know I’m compensated well (in the grand scheme of things). At my current company, I've seen many people get promoted to 1 level above me, but I see very few DEs who are 2+ levels above me. Here, DEs are paid less than SWEs (at equivalent levels). I am concerned that the limited focus of the work, combined with using primarily in-house tools, will make my skills less transferable later.
* **I might get laid off soon.** We've had mass layoffs and we will likely have more, and there is increased pressure to PIP people. In my most recent performance review, I was rated sub-par, so I think that makes me more vulnerable.
* **The economy is not doing so hot.**  Yeah yeah yeah, we all know.  I originally wrote a draft of this post before the Silicon Valley Bank mess.  I understand that things kinda suck right now, but I’m trying to think about my career 5-10 years in the future, and I don’t want to have regrets because I took the “safe” path just staying in my lane and keeping my head down.

**WHAT I WOULD LIKE IN MY FUTURE CAREER**:

* Build up my general SWE skills. I've started going through the curriculum on teachyourselfcs.com, and I do enjoy reading and doing the exercises in SICP.
* Build up my stats & ML skills. Even though my education was math-heavy, I'm still kinda light on stats. I have started reading ""Intro to Statistical Learning with R"" to fill in some gaps, and I intend to move on to teaching myself PyTorch.
* Work in an area that hopefully uses more math, or at least an area that solves more interesting problems.
* Work in an area that's relatively lucrative with significant growth potential.

**POTENTIAL PATHS FORWARD**:

* **Apply for jobs as an ML Engineer.** This would be a big leap at the moment since I still need to build up experience with a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow, and the job market is especially competitive. I do have experience in data at a FAANG company, and I have a STEM graduate degree, so maybe that would help me get my foot in the door at a smaller lower-paying company. Not actually sure, just guessing here. But I wouldn’t want to take a job paying less than $150K. 
* **Look for DE jobs, but aim for ones that have a broader scope.** Maybe something like a ""full-stack data scientist"" role where I would be doing both DE work and ML work.
* **Apply for SWE jobs.** Maybe I could apply for backend jobs that are more data-adjacent (to get my foot in the door), or I could look for SWE  jobs that interface more directly with ML, or specialize in some other interesting topic.

**QUESTIONS**:

* **Q1**: Has anyone here switched job titles from data engineer to machine learning engineer? Or from data engineer to more general software engineer? Do you feel it was worth it?
* **Q2**: Am I right in thinking the career path for data engineers is a bit more stunted compared to other areas in tech? Maybe I have that perception because, at my company, pay for DEs is lower compared to SWEs, and there are fewer people at higher levels. But maybe that's a myopic view. My girlfriend has tried to convince me not to fully abandon the DE path, pointing out how DEs are sometimes paid as much as SWEs  at other companies, and there is still a lot of demand for DEs.
* **Q3**: In case people here think ML is overhyped (which it probably is, though I find it interesting), are there other areas of tech that people with math backgrounds have found enjoyable?

556,Should I change my major,11oviof,"TLDR: should I lock myself into a software engineering degree or choose a degree that covers more aspects of tech jobs



I'm going to try and make this post not sound like the other broken record posts that I see here, I feel my view point is different than those. I'm currently attending WGU for a bachelor's degree in software engineering. I'm 29 and needed a career change and have always been interested in computers and dabbled with a lot of hardware and recently some software. The reddit doomers have been saying that SWE is dead and the job market is fucked and will remain to be fucked. I don't think that is true because although I may not know a lot about SWE I do know job market statistics and understand the impact tech has on the future. I believe it will bounce back and the jobs will be there. 

What I have thought about though is maybe I am locking myself in a box as far as my degree goes. My thought is to change my major to a different degree that encompasses more than just SWE, something like:

B.S. Information technology
B.S. Networking & Security
B.S. Cloud computing
B.S. Cyber Security

Yes, my program is great but I feel like every one of those other programs has more certs, a wider overview of tech as a whole, and the same timeline of completion. For example do I learn only about SWE or do I broaden my area of studies so I can have diverse career options in things besides SWE. I am early enough in the program that everything I have completed so far will transfer to a different degree. Maybe I end up liking network security better? All of those programs have scripting and programming courses but the SWE program is more robust. I feel like this may be a much safer option for me.

I'm considering transferring from the University of Connecticut (currently working on a BS Computer Science) to one of the CUNYs (CCNY has a quality program from my understanding), for a variety of reasons. As a start, I have a family which is narcissistic and queerphobic, and it's not a situation that I think I can maintain for the next three years of my education.

I enjoy software (and writing it would probably be a small part of my life even if I had all the money in the world), but I really don't like doing it under deadlines and a boss. 

As a result, I got hooked into the FIRE movement pretty early on.

However, layoffs + recent work stress have made me realize that I'm no longer interested in gunning for the big bucks. 

I used to think about pivoting to the trading industry / switching to management / leveling up the IC ladder fast, but I don't care about those things anymore.

Instead, my new aim is to hit senior and find places where I can do my 9-5, leave work at work, and spend the rest of my time on my hobbies (volleyball and screenwriting). 

Financially, I just want the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $200k / yr all-in. This would be more than enough to live my life, have fun, and still make steady progress toward my FIRE goals.

However, I'm all too aware that situations at work can change at the drop of a hat. 

So my question is this - what's the minimum level of interview-ready I can be to always be able to quickly find a $200k Sr. SWE job in (relatively) normal job market? 

Including that last piece because I know there's probably nothing I can do in this kind of employer's market as a job-seeker that would give me that sort of leverage.

1. Coding: be able to solve any Grind75 question in my sleep (~170 questions total)
2. System design: know the system design primer + designing data-intensive applications like the back of my hand. 
3. Technologies / domain-specific??? I've only worked in big tech companies, so this has never been a part of my interview loop. However, from what I've heard, startups and local shops care a lot about familiarity with specific tech stacks.

I plan to start school again in January 2024 or start in August of 2024 depending on my financial situation. (I’m working atm to save money.)

What are some things I can do in this year to prepare in this 1-1.5 year off I have? What are some books I can read? Some skills I can learn? Maybe even some helpful advice?

To any who respond, thank you ahead of time! :)",ChrisD4902,5,0,0.5
564,Toxic or not,11osy0v,"Toxic or not/ should I quit or not:  
Two of us (me and 'A') plus a mentor ('M') was assigned to create an endpoint for a new web service. 'A' was assigned their own ticket and I was assigned mine. 'A' overdid everything and even completed the part I had to complete.  Note, I'm a new hire so the point was for me to learn. 'A' had apparently assumed that my task/ticket was about something else, even though any person listening to our group conversations would realize they were doing my work (plus it was clearly not a part of their ticket at least). I was adding more features than what 'A' did, but it seems the service won't have use for those extra stuff. So now my 3-4 days of work basically went to waste. I was already very upset on Thursday to see that happen but I thought M would stand up for me and say something like ""let's add the changes from your ticket in a new PR once we finish reviewing this current PR"". But instead he also pretty much stole any chance for me to add anything (the extra stuff) by pushing a new commit today and saying that there's request for pushing this service out quicker. Note, I find 'M' sometimes working on weekends and I'm just like, ""am I supposed to work, too? If yes, why don't people just mention that beforehand instead of sending random texts during the weekend?""

It has happened in the past as well that whatever I worked on - guessing, trying my best to understand their codebase as a new hire thrown into poor documentation - got overlooked and ultimately someone came up with the same idea as I had voiced but somehow they believe they are teaching me something new. 

I'm so tired of this. I take care to ensure my language is always clear and in fact took initiative myself to schedule a feedback session with my manager (it seemed to catch him off guard but he then said he was happy to talk) to understand what they expect from me. I ask for deadlines but no one gives me any. Generally everyone is too comfortable in their jobs (we're talking people past their 40s). Everyone has been here in this suburb 10+ years and I'm just a new grad, moving from a big college to this suburb and just living here for the job. So when frustrating things like this happen, I just want to quit because I have nothing else here I'm affiliated to. I believe I'm quite smart and hard working. I believe I should and can find a new job.

565,What are you experiences with prep courses for cracking the hiring process?,11oswc5,"Hey everyone,

I am currently working as an ML SWE at a small startup and am looking to find a new job at a bigger company. I was recently contacted by someone from an interview prep course, that promises to help you ace coding assignments, review and polish your resume / LinkedIn, put you in touch with ""their people"", guide you through the interview process and then help negotiate salary. Sounds great right?

I attended their live session and came away thinking that, while the tuition is high, if they can deliver on their promise to its entirety, or at the very least actually give you the contacts and resources they advertise then it might be worth it. However, I can also see many ways how it could be a money grab operation. For one thing, the lack of concreteness during the live session, makes me skeptical about their offering.

Has anybody every gone through one of these to find a job and if so what was your experience?

566,"Got fired, what do I say to recruiters/potential new employers when they ask why I'm currently unemployed?",11o51n0,"I was properly fired from my job recently and it really sucks. I was let go for bad performance (after getting a great review, a proper blindside) and still struggling to understand exactly how I was labeled as such (with reflection I can say that I got a little behind on a deadline but I was being assigned higher priority stuff that I was completing and I was constantly context switching. I thought I was delivering a lot and was putting in long days and some weekends to get things done, but in a reasonable manner without completely killing myself, I think. Is work-life balance even real, ha). Still, it doesn’t make sense and I’ve really looked at my actions and tried to see how I could learn from this and what I could have possibly done wrong or differently. Still coming up empty and my former colleagues are confused as well. At this point, I’m trying to not be upset at what happened and just move on despite the huge blow and uncertainty around how much being fired has set me back in my career. 

All that being said, in retrospect I should have negotiated and asked to be laid off instead, but I was too paralyzed by the sheer 180 in my reality. Overnight my boss and I went from having what I thought was a good relationship to one of complete judgement with him seeming almost giddy after giving me the axe.

Now I’m here, trying to apply for new roles and I just don’t know what to say. I feel like I’m carrying a stink that I can’t wash off and I’m afraid that my chances for future employment will be severely impacted by the fact that I was fired and not laid off, especially with job market in its current state. What am I going to tell recruiters/hiring managers when they ask why I no longer work at my old gig? “Great question! I was fired/terminated/let go for being a bad performer but I promise that’s bs and I’m a great senior engineer! Hire me!” Ugh. It feels awful to even have to defend myself and I feel very low and unjustly labeled. My confidence is shot. It also sucks because I have almost 8 years of experience and was always a highly respected engineer who was known for their work quality and ethic. At previous companies I was also promoted and received bonuses pretty regularly based on my good performance, sigh. And although I have a good network, I don’t want to apply to roles my dev friends suggest because I don’t want to make them look bad for referring someone who’s been fired.  

This experience has done a number on my mental health at many levels and the timing is both a blessing and curse given the blood bath that’s been the tech scene as of late. How do I communicate this while applying/interviewing without shooting myself in the foot?

567,Advice choosing school path,11osbr5,"Hello, I will do my best to keep this concise and brief. 

I am 27/m with a wife and three children and live in the Midwest. I am a full time Journeyman Industrial Mechanic for one of the big three American Automakers. I have a significant amount of down/free time at work which has allowed me to pursue higher education. I currently am attending University of Maryland Global Campus. This fall I will be going into my 2nd year of undergrad. Now I will get to my question(s).. 

My initial plan was to transfer to Oregon State University this fall as a full time online student for their BS in CS, and to finish my degree in 3 years. I planned to transfer there because from what I've read, they seem to have a more rigorous and respected program compared to UMGC. Recently I discovered that UMGC is accepting training from my time in the military as 30 elective credit hours. In doing so, my degree would only take 2 years to complete, compared to 3 years at OSU. 

To get to my point: 

I am a full time working adult, with a family in children, and I work in a unrelated career field. So internships/co-ops are off the table. My goal with obtaining my degree is to learn as much as possible and become as prepared   As possible to change careers. My degree is not to check a box. 

Should I stick to my original plan of 3 years of education at OSU in their CS program, or should I finish an accelerated path at UMGC and try to get into the field a year sooner? Both degrees would be a BS in CS. I would still take all major and gen ed requirements. I would take little to no electives at UMGC, and would take 30 credit hours of electives at OSU. 

Neither school cost me anything because of my GI Bill and employer tuition assistance. 

Being in the Midwest, does either school hold more weight over the other? 

Since I have no work experience in this field, would OSU program prepare me more than UMGC? Or would UMGC prepare me enough and I should start working sooner?

I am very interested in the work the company does and I will be able to get a full time position at the company once I graduate (provided my work is sufficient). I like this security and the internship will look great on my CV but I will be taking out another year. 

My friends have told me that I will be missing another year, and that I can be earning actual graduate salaries at the end of university a year earlier if I just go univeristy and give up the internship. I have also been told that if I can get this internship, I can probably get another one. However, I personally like the security and don't care about delaying the university experience another year if it will benefit me in the long term. My overall goal is to be in the best possible position for my career, aiming to do challenging work that involves a lot of mathematics at a top company and maybe eventually start my own company. 

How much of a difference will my university make to my overall goal of working at a big tech company.

I understand .NET is quite popular in those countries, but what I can do in my spare time to maximise my chances of landing a job offer in the above countries? 

I am currently learning Go because its mostly used for backend and to land a job offer because of its rarity. I was planning on contributing to some of the larger Go open source projects like Docker or CoachroachDB to put on my resume. However most Go BE positions I’ve seen are more than willing to take you, even without Go experience. So is my time wasted learning Go?

I would ideally like to move into the JVM ecosystem and out of the “Microsoft tech stack” (C#, .NET, SQL Server, Azure etc.) that a lot of .NET companies seem to fall into. Should I rather build some SpringBoot projects with some GraphQL, Kafka etc. technologies added in and put it on my resume? Could I give some Scala a go?

I understand that specific technologies don’t really matter, but tonnes of companies in Europe (and including where I am from) mostly believe in “{specific tech stack} engineer” instead of “software engineer”.

7,Really conflicted between ML/CS PhD vs. fully funded MSCS,11vudmc,"Crossposting from r/AskAcademia \- thought I could get some useful knowledge from a different group of folks.

I'm in a really tough situation and have been feeling acutely ill over making a decision. I would be really grateful for some advice.

I graduated from a prestigious university with a bachelors in CS last spring, and have been working and making a really comfortable salary in a big tech company (return offer on a summer 2021 internship). I had worked with an assistant professor on ML research for the last two years and had a good and productive time; the professor really believed in me, and towards the last semester, suggested that I apply for PhD programs in that area.

I did not believe that I could get into any PhD programs this cycle, as this particular subfield is extremely competitive, and so figured that I would not seriously decide whether or not to do a PhD unless I get in. I only targeted very competitive places and applied to my undergrad's fully-funded, research-focused MS program (most likely I'd be working with the same advisor again) as a backup.

All my results came in, and I have gotten into a number of very good PhD programs, as well as the MSCS backup. Among my PhD offers, one is from a non-top 4 CS school which ranks among the top 3 of my subfield, and the advisor that I got is very, very good. The prospective PhD advisor is extremely well-connected and super nice, and my undergraduate advisor was previously affiliated with their group and could not have anything more positive to say.

Among the academic folks whom I've spoken to, the overwhelming consensus is that I should just go to the state school and work with that professor. And I feel like if I were to pursue a PhD, I would definitely take up the offer. But I've been getting very cold feet about the whole business of doing a PhD; my undergrad experience was very stressful and I just could not imagine 6 more years of lowish pay (that particular school gives the lowest stipend, despite being located in a fairly expensive city). I have zero interest in becoming a professor and would ideally like to be in research-oriented roles in the industry, and that's why I'm seriously considering the MSCS backup. At this point, I'm pretty set on going back to school, given the turbulence and ongoing layoffs in the tech industry.

Here are some direct concerns about going into the PhD:

1. Earning a livable wage and having savings are definitely very important to me and I can't justify walking away from an six-figure annual salary and living for 5-6 years on a $30K-ish PhD stipend. Comparatively, the MSCS stipend is on the higher end (\~$50K) with a good exit opportunity to industry after 2 years.
2. I love parts of the research process, but I won't deny that it was highly stressful and I came out of undergrad feeling extremely burnt out, with horrible work-life balance and a lot of unprocessed emotional issues. My quality of life has greatly improved since getting into a normal 9-5, but I just can't imagine 6 more years of going through that again.
3. Maybe the one slightly negative thing (and it's not a big issue) is that the PhD advisor is pretty hands-off given that they already have tenure and are affiliated with some industry connections. I am definitely not a very skilled researcher and would need a lot of hands-on guidance, especially in the first few years. The group is very nice, with senior students, but for the most part it seems decentralized (some people are remote / WFH), so I worry that I wouldn't be getting enough mentorship.
4. Not a huge factor, but something I'd have to mentally come to terms with: the PhD program itself has incredible prestige within the subarea, but the school's lay prestige is much lower than my undergrad's.

The primary reason for moving forward with the PhD is that this is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; this advisor is the dream advisor for many other applicants and I feel that I would not get as good of an offer again were I to decide later on in life to pursue a PhD. I am also feeling extremely pressured by a lot of people in academia to just go do the PhD and not even consider the MSCS (not a good feeling).",6ottle,1,1,1.0
8,Career switch into Software Development,11vtlig,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a 38M, and I'm in the midst of leaving my current job as a retail marijuana dispensary manager, for a company I've worked for since 2010 and I am wrestling with a couple different routes to take. My first thought is to enroll in an online coding bootcamp as that is the shorter path and from what I have found, it doesn't necessarily make you job ready, but if you really apply yourself, in time an entry level position can be found. The other option is to go back to school and take the longer, but accredited approach, and come out earning a CS degree that opens more doors than if I had no college degree and just a bootcamp certificate, which to be honest, doesn't mean much. I've been self learning for almost a year in my free time (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python) so I'm not completely uninformed of the basics of building out websites, syntax, etc., but with all the craziness of tech layoffs, hiring freezes, on top of the recession only feeling like it's gonna get worse before it gets better, I'm wondering if the slower approach of going to school for a CS degree is the safer option for someone like myself that has no college degree of any kind, and has gone from managing a medical marijuana dispensary to a recreational dispensary for the last dozen years. I'm single, no kids, no debt and will be moving in with a relative in Seattle, and they're letting me live rent free for the rest of the year until I either finish a bootcamp or start taking classes and getting myself settled in as a student again, so I am very fortunate to have a pretty easy road in front of me to pursue this career change however I decide to.

My manager said the next skill I should pick up is mentoring other juniors and some peers. So he's given me complete control of a mid size project (~3 months ish) execution wise. I have another junior collaborating closely with me. 

Now, my manager explicitly told me that I am not to develop anything in this project since my technical skills are already proved and it's time to go into larger stuff. My task is just overseeing execution, help my junior in designing the feature technically and identify risks. I am to help her in development only if the delivery date is at risk. 

Now, based on my interaction with her, I know she's smart. But she's unaware of a lot of design principles so most of the times, I have to explain it to her with a toy example, correlate it with our use case and then we can progress. 

She's able to grasp a lot of this stuff but she's not able to come up with this on her own when I hint at the solution.

13,Advice on a stepping-stone job for someone currently studying CS,11vqf57,"I've recently went back to Uni to study Software Dev. I am only doing part-time because I have previously been to Uni and also work full-time in something fairly unrelated. 

I know it's unrealistic for me to get a Junior Job after only studying for a year or so, but I would like to move to something a bit more in line with IT etc.

So plainly, the question is, what are some jobs that may be fairly easy to get into that could set me up for when I eventually get to the point of applying for Junior Dev roles? I have been in the workplace for around 6 years now, working in quasi-electrical engineering/technician roles. Maybe also worth noting that I am in the UK.

Last week he scheduled a 1:1 with me and I gotta say the call did not go as well as I expected. Now with all my previous bosses the first 1:1 is always just a polite intro discussion where we talk about our past experience and what we hope to achieve working together. But this guy was the opposite. He didn’t introduce himself at all, and wanted to know exactly what I was working on and started assigning me tasks that he wanted done by EOD. His tone the entire time was very condescending and he sort of laughs off any of your answers (nervous tick?). He didn’t give a shit who I was at all and I could also tell he has little sense of humor. Maybe it was just a bad first impression and I would like to give him the benefit of the doubt.

23,"26 year old fuckup, should I continue to try and learn code to be employable or just give up?",11vjvwe," 

Hello everyone I'm 26 \[M\], back when I graduated HS at 18, my mom made me go to university so we could keep up with the Joneses. So I moved to a bigger city 1 hour away to study to be a Dental Technician (making dentures, implants, crowns, veneers for dentists), fast forward during Uni I was really depressed/very high social anxiety so I could not make any friends from my class or keep up with school work due to depression and laziness.

I managed to get a few internships, interned at like 4 dental labs during the 3 year period from which I was either fired or left due to not liking the job itself and not pushing myself hard enough to learn the trade from the people there.

After finishing Dental Tech Uni, I found a place to work, at the start I was working for free for 4 months, then I got paid lower than minimum wage for 2 months before quitting due to not advancing or learning anything there, because the people there were too busy to teach me anything, so at this point I would have interned at 6 labs so far and nothing fucking sticked, so I decided to leave Dental Tech altogether.

At this point I was 22 and bought into the whole ""just learn to code bro"", so I decided to pursue that. I told my mom I was going to try to pursue coding, she told me only if I enrolled into Uni again (Uni was paid for by the government since I had good grades in highschool).

So I went to Uni for IT and my first day there I met the biggest shithead 18 year old dude which I became friends with to not be suicidal and lonely for 3 years again, this guy wanted to do alcohol and drugs every single day while his parents drove his ass to Uni and back everyday and paid for everything.

So I skipped most classes because they were way over my head (Uni level math, which I had never done in Highschool) and went drinking with that guy most days.

During my first year I tried teaching myself web development through courses and tutorials hoping for the best. Last year I finished IT Uni and got my degree and realised I barely know any programming since following courses and doing tutorial projects did not solidify barely any coding information in my brain.

Now I'm almost 26, have some very basic web dev projects on my GitHub that I can barely explain and failed my first 3 interviews that I got during the span of 6 months of applying for jobs.

I guess my question really is, should I quit programming and go back to being a Dental Technician even if I wasn't successful in that field for so long? (I would have to go back and take a couple of exams and finish my thesis since I didn't get my Dental degree).

I live with my mom and am depressed to the point where I can barely study coding for 2 hours, there are barely any jobs in the small town that I currently live in and if I did get a minimum wage job here I would be the laughing stock of everyone, since most ppl here know I went to Uni for so long.",necropoly,25,0,0.39

27,Lost motivation to study after work after stopped studying to rest from stress,11vfy2t,"I had lot of stress like 1-2 months ago. I had my rule to study for 4 hours a week after work. And I almost always used it. Plus I used to do something to create my own business.

But at that time I got big task, and they were questioning me how much has left to do and I did not know exactly and I knew it will go over the deadline which was causing stress.

So I decided while this is so stressful period, to not study, but just relax as much as I want.

And now this stressful period ended. But I am not finding motivation to study. It feels so good to chat on social networks, watch youtube videos.

When it is work hours I work normally, not being lazy. But just when work hours end I just want to have fun. I also see on linked in so many reqruiters writing me if I want to talk. Also my company raised my salary even without me asking to do so. So it feels I am so safe and that kills motivation probably.

But I had been fired many times from jobs. So when I get fired, I think now I will get a job and on the side I have to make my business, so I can finally be my own boss and never be fired. And once I feel that safe, I lose motivation.

But knowing the history, there is no guarantee that I will not be fired. Or there can be that I myself might want to quit if I will have to work with people with whom I do not feel good, who are mobbing me. So it would be nice to still have my business. Or at least learn technologies so that I would have what to tell what I learned in the next job interview. I have something to tell. But I know learning little by little is good, adds up overtime.

&#x200B;

now if i try to force myself, I think - I might become old always workiung. Do I want to have as much fun or be as productive as possible.

I might die with lots of wealth but not used my time for fun. Is it really worth? Thats why the motivation question comess - do I need that much motivation to work/study to live best possible life? I am already getting used to work but I remember as cghild, I used every possible free minute to have fun, I did not care about money And I kind of miss those times.

On the other hand having money made me less dependant on parents who did not let me relax while playing computer games.

Mow I have money that I could buy new car for example without problems but I think the toy would soon not guve me the joy. It quickly becomes boring so its not worth to spend big money on toys. Only one reason to buy new car is safety - hopefully it would be much safer than my 2009 year car which works well and is much cheaper and in case somebody damages it - also less loss.

&#x200B;

So I kind of do not need mucg money.

But much money could be needed if I want to easily find nice girl. I am not good with girks but with money you can buy them even if you are computer nerd. But that requires lot of money. I notice no matter how much you spend on girls, they are still not happy. So then you have to work all the time and if you have fun they start not letting you to relax. So again do I want that? I like company of girls but not sure if I can be happy in a relationship with them, considfering the price paid in money, time, emotions.

But overall I think the better I do at job, the less motivation I have to study and create my own business. I probably need to be fired, then I will be kicked in the ass :D",Want_easy_life,10,0,0.23

I'm a travel nurse currently contemplating a career change to become a software engineer. I've been inspired by the advancements in technology and the potential to solve complex problems through coding.

Before taking the plunge, I wanted to seek advice from those of you who have successfully transitioned into this field from a different background. I'm particularly interested in hearing about:

What resources (books, courses, bootcamps, etc.) were most helpful in your journey?

How important was having a formal degree in computer science or a related field when entering the job market? 

What was the biggest challenge you faced during the transition, and how did you overcome it?

Additionally, with the rapid growth of AI, I'm curious about how software engineers view its impact on job prospects in the field. Is AI expected to create more opportunities, or will it reduce the demand for traditional software engineering roles? How can we prepare for and adapt to these changes?

Personally, I’m unsure if I want to go into software engineering or data science. While I’m leaning towards data science, I don’t want to pick a major that’s a serious disadvantage if I decide to go into software engineering.

1. Stick with UCSD data science

I also have a job in a different field for $50K+/yr ($23+hr). The dilemma is that, there’s only about 8 weeks/2 months between my starting date work date and Internship start date.

I'm a cs major currently taking a course on [software development fundamentals](https://www.engineeringonline.ncsu.edu/course/csc-216-software-development-fundamentals/), and I'm feeling pretty confused about which direction to take in computer science. While I find software design and OOP kind of boring, I absolutely loved my first taste of computer science through Harvard's CS50, especially when we were working with C programming.

What's it like to work as a software engineer? Is it all about designing software and OOP, or are there some cool projects out there, like using the Sobel operator to do edge detection on images using C? Or is it a good mix of both?

I found that recently that some of the other people I work with are getting a bit more in terms of salary than I am because they have more experience. Although they don't necessarily do more work or provide more value. So I had asked my manager what she thought was a good way for me to increase my salary. I didn't compare salaries or anything like that. I just focused on me and what I offer.

She told me that other than the annual cost of living raises. The only real way for me to get any substantial raise would be to become a staff engineer. Which I guess is the next rung on the ladder.

The issue is I really don't want to be a staff engineer. The people I've worked with who are staff engineers are all people of a certain type. It's just not something that I really want for myself.

48,How hard is it to switch employers while on a work visa? (US),11v1z0w,"Hey, I've recently moved to the US on an L1 visa sponsored by my employer. (Located in NYC)

I've wanting to change jobs for a while (For various reasons - get experience in other technologies, improve salary etc). 

I've tried looking around a little to see if there are other employers that can sponsor a visa for me, so far, no luck. (But admittedly I have not been looking very aggressively). I've had a few headhunters approaching me but always saying that the job does not sponsor visas when I asked. 

I'm a senior Front-End developer (5 years of experience). I'm looking for a job involving react, despite having all of my experience in Angular (which I want to move away from). I'm open to full stack as long as it's TS in the backend. I'm confident in my skills to impress in an interview, even though my skills may not be as obvious from my resume.

Does anyone know how hard it is (or if it's even possible) to change employers while being on an L1 visa? I wonder how hard I should work on trying to find a new employer right now, or do I have to wait until I can get a green card (Which could take a few years). It's also possible that I have not had much luck because of the way the market is right now, so maybe if I wait a year, it will be better 🤷

52,"First week of work after graduation, work environment feels too toxic, demanding and frustrating, Is it just me or is it with most of the startups/ companies?",11uzz6p,"To start with: I'm an international student on F1 visa - so quitting is not an option unless I've another offer. I've already used 70% of my OPT unemployment days as well (and it's very difficult to land a job in this market).

**TLDR:** Poor onboarding, worked 55hrs on weekdays, expected to work on weekends, my opinions are not valued or even acknowledged, super ambitious goals - at least from me and super low pay to justify any of the above. Week 1 into work and I'm frustrated, annoyed and pissed. I was 'expected to solve some problems', but here I'm just thinking over my decisions to join this company. Is this because I've never worked in the industry? Or is this beyond being crazy? **TLDR ends**

A bit of my technical background: I consider myself to have strong hold on programming, particularly Machine Learning. I do not have any ""industry experience"", but I've had few interns, about a year of freelance and loads of 'good' academic projects; if it matters, I've a Masters degree. I fairly consider these to make up for lack of experience and put me in a batch of 1-2 YoE. I've always loved the idea of working at a startup for following reasons: working on comparatively cooler work, brainstorming, value for my opinion, high paced work (not the work-is-life kind of high pace though).

A bit about my behavior (based on how I see and what my close one's have told): I'm (brutally) honest, and upfront about everything - if I don't like X, I'll let you know; and in terms of work, I'll expect you to work on it. The current codebase is trash. I'll let you know. The current build is not worth to make it to deployment. I'll let you know. I don't agree with you, I'll let you know.

Longer version:

Now, to start off with the actual scenario (warning: 90% rant below):

*Everything in italics are the founder/ other member's comments summarized.*

So, I start working with Company A as a Machine Learning Engineer (in theory, there's one more MLE for the past 2 years - but he knows NOTHING about ML except maybe ResNet18). Apart from me, there are 3 core engineers, the founder and a few non-tech people. Company is in a very early stage, seed phase, but already in profits so unsure about the next investment round. Below is my journey so far.

Day 1: A 30m call to tell me what project I've to work on - no examples, no samples, no onboarding, no introduction to current codebase. I was invited to the repository and asked to do everything else on my own. I was even on the wrong track for half of the day. I told myself, okay it's day one, let's see how things go.

Day 2: I come up with 'suggestions' that these are some models, techniques and ideas that we explore and see what works. *""le them: good, now deploy it in production by tonight""*. Wait what? I suggested we can spend time to figure out how this works, what options we've. Keeping most of the part anonymous: we're trying to build a model for a task that has NEVER been done in the domain. There's no dataset, there are no examples, there are no leads. To sum it, I've to come up with a solution which should takes at the very least 2-3 weeks (possibly even months) of work; and finish it in a day. EOD: I tell them this is best we've right now, and it doesn't even look like 5% accurate.

Day 3: *We're still going to push it, so do it.* All frustrated, clueless, I wrap the code, tell them it's done and guess what? I have to integrate it with existing code without any knowledge and the other members denying to hop on a call because it is supposed to be *""my task"".* All they did was point me to 2 utility functions that are a part of what I'll use after everything is done. Other than that, I've no clue what's happening (there's no documentation/ comments - only way is to go line by line and trace process; this triggers me because they can literally hop on a 10m call and explain me instead of asking me to spend 4-5hrs trying to do it on my own). Finally, I push out the model, as expected, it barely keeps up with expectations and that's done.

Day 4: *Okay you deployed it, but it's not exporting correctly.* Wasn't I using YOUR code to export? Why am I to debug that? Anyways, I do that, and I'm directly assigned another task which is to be deployed by end of next day. To ensure we're on the same page, I confirmed it with 2 people (founder and 1 team member) that I see a function which uses external API in location X, which I'm to change with an in-house model. They agree and I start working on it. Summary: Change X with Y.

Day 5: I had commitments in the evening, so I login earlier (8am) and let the everyone know I need to leave at 6pm (10hrs of work is already MORE THAN ENOUGH). I make a deployment, not happy with the results, I rollback to previous version and 5:30pm I let them know the status. History again, forced to deploy *('if it doesn't work, we'll take the responsibility').* I push it back, deploy and done. Now guess what? They don't just want it to be \`X -> Y\`, they want it as an API - which is pain, because of its dependency on the existing codebase. I let them know I've a commitment to keep up and I need to leave. If needed, I can take a look when I return, or have it on priority on Monday (PS: the old X works as well, so it wasn't like the customers would see any difference). But no, I'm to build the API and push it today itself before leaving. Fair, I do my part. I test locally, everything works; I let them know. The other co-worker, who takes care of pushing the deployments, wasn't around - I waited around 10m. I was already 2hrs late for my commitment, so I sign off letting them know that I've pushed and left.

Day 6 (today - we schedule a 'chat' for yesterday's events): *You weren't allowed to leave before you test everything* (FFS? I TOLD YOU I NEED TO LEAVE AT A PARTICULAR TIME. I'M STAYING BACK FOR YOUR LAST-MINUTE CHANGES AND YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT MORE FOR A COWORKER TO COME AND DEPLOY FOR WHICH I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN?). *Since your joining, your work isn't meeting our performance criteria* (Hello? You want me to understand the complete problem statement, come up with a novel solution, collect the dataset, research all possibilities, experiment with the models, implement the final one and test it - all of this in 2 days while also dealing with your existing codebase? Sorry, but this is not ""select \* from table"" we're talking about: not saying SQL is easy by any means\*) *Now, I want you to fix the yesterday's deployment before Monday AND work on your previous model and give me an improvement.* (Um, I thought you were taking the responsibility for the yesterday's work? And why am I asked to work on weekdays if I already poured freaking 55hrs on the weekdays? And for the previous model, I WILL NEED MORE TIME, A LOT MORE THAN 2 DAYS). *So, get working on it, and finish it before Monday. Also, we need further improvements on the previous model before next Friday and you're being assigned to 2 other tasks as well.* (No comments, I was just quite after this part).

I'll break down both perspectives, so it'll give a better understanding of where my frustration is coming from.

Their POV:

* I'm one of the initial hires, which makes it fair for them to expect more from me.
* The current employees had never followed 'best practices', which explains the current state of codebase.
* They may have some deadlines to meet, which explains the quicker deployments, even if unfinished.

My POV:

* If you're expecting me to work 55hrs on weekdays, AND THEN work on weekends; I'm not taking 55-60% of what an average engineer is paid in my region (I'm paid way less than average pay for a SE).
* Fair, your current codebase isn't too easy to deal with for a newcomer. Care to have an onboarding to tell me where to look for? Right now, I just have access to the repository, and the rest is on me to figure it out because apparently, ""it's my job.""
* I don't see how putting out a useless model to production makes any sense - this is available to all the existing customers. Doesn't that have a negative impact over your reputation?

For me, no matter how much I try to improve my mood and push myself to start liking the work; all of the above keeps pushing me further away and makes me want to see the job only as a placeholder for my visa till I get another job. I tried having a conversation with the founder. For any doubts I've regarding existing codebase, *""this is your job to figure it out""*; and for any questions regarding the work culture/ quality/ ambitious goals: *""this is how we work""*.

So, at this point, I can't tell if I'm being overwhelmed by the amount of work, or frustrated because of being ""bossed around"", or angry because they ""don't care"" for my personal life and commitments (this is what the founder said outright to me) but they expect me to care about their product and take the responsibility. I had a talk with few of my close ones and everyone had a different opinion. Some say it's almost how everyone works (or every company has its own issues), let few weeks pass. Some argue it's too much and I should start looking for other offers ASAP (if so, how do I justify my 1 week of experience?).

62,Advice for asking boss to relocate and work remotely permanently?,11ut3ps,"Some background: I’ve been working at medium sized company for about 2 years out of college now as a full stack developer (node, react, AWS). I started out with a very low salary with no internships. About a year ago I got an offer from another company and accepted a counter-offer to stay for a salary in the low six figures. I’m happy with my job and the company is still doing well despite the economic downturn with no signs of slowing down.

I worked remotely out of state for a couple months last year and have been looking to move there since. My job required a return to office 3 days a week 6 months ago and almost no one including upper management shows up more than once a week. We also have a bunch of employees out of state that will work remotely indefinitely, but HR is not allowing “remote conversions” at this time.

I’m in a weird situation in that I’m well respected at my current job, but I can’t find a new job that will pay close to what I make with the market downturn. I’ve had around 10 interviews over the past 6 months and received a couple offers below my current salary so far, but I wasn’t really interested in these companies anyways.

One thing I have to my advantage is that I have a good rapport with my boss and the tech VP and they have struggled with attrition over the past year, so I don‘t think they are willing to just let more people go. My boss said he personally won’t enforce any office mandates and won’t be complying with RTO. The company can clearly accommodate remote despite HR policy, as they have remote employees around the country. 

I feel like it would be foolish to leave a solid job in this current market as it puts me on the top list for layoffs, but at the same time it has been rough for my mental health living here and looking to move asap.

65,How long should I stay in my first job?,11urih9,"**Context:** I am in my mid-20's, a full-stack bootcamp graduate coming from a different field, currently working as a react front-end dev. I was hired remotely for a niche tech company based in NY, also where I live. Have been here about 7 months. I took the job mostly because it was the first and really only job offer I got after an internship and a long and frustrating search. I am grateful for my first break and understand that movement elsewhere will be easier with experience. My frustration currently is that the company culture is VERY laid back if not simply lacking structure/leadership. My team consists of me another junior, and our team lead. 

**The Issue:** I want to move upward in the field and expand my knowledge of CS and development in general. I am not learning any industry-standard practices where I am. There are very few meetings, no real code reviews, no performance reviews, etc... I get that at a small (10-15) person company some of these practices might waste time or hinder efficiency but it brings an aura that lacks motivation. I am generally an outgoing person and soft skills have never been an issue for me but haven't grown these skills in the context of tech. I am learning when I have time (cs50, leetcode, building personal projects), but also don't want to make development my waking life. I also feel like they hired 2 juniors to pay them less (making 60k) and while money is money, NY is incredibly expensive. 

**The Question:** How long should I stay before looking to move on without it looking bad? I feel bad because they do rely on our work. The other junior dev is comfortable just getting his work done and not being very present but he is probably working another job. The only positive I see in staying is having a real dev job under my belt so I don't want to take off too early. I do not think I am being set up for success and staying motivated is hard. I do not want to fall into a bad routine and also want a higher salary lol.

**TL;DR:** Bootcamp grad working first (remote) job (react dev), being underpaid? (60k) at a small tech company.

Looking at the state of this sub, things aren't looking really good right now.

I'm doing an online degree now (post-bacc at OSU) and am wondering if there's an 'ideal' time to graduate. If I cram now I can realistically finish Summer 2024. If I extend I can probably go until 2025. 

Would it be better to get the degree over with ASAP or to wait out a bit?

During my 8 months long bootcamp, we learned mostly about Java and also a little bit of everything like; Spring, MySQL, Angular, Maven, Design patterns etc. During the classes I learned a lot of theory and logic of coding.

Since my bootcamp has finished I did some small projects. I have this habit where I spend a lot of time on small details and this sometimes make me feel like I am wasting time. I know that I lack a lot of technical knowledge. I want to focus on more important stuff instead of some unnecessary details.

To improve my skills and to be ready for job interviews, I started doing those ""**Top Interview Questions""** on LeetCode. Almost everyday I learn new ways of solving problems, I started to feel overwhelmed by all the different ways on how u can solve problems. I always try to solve myself without looking for solutions. After spending half an hour or more I look to the solution and try to understand it.

Learning everyday is an important part of a developer I agree and I also enjoy it. But I also expect to be able to achieve more with what I already know. But it feels like it's always just not enough. I get sometimes tired of always studying. This also makes me think that I am not ready for the technical interviews.

It is also not only about solving the question, I also want to understand it and to be able to explain the process to myself and others. Is it a must to be comfortable with those type of exercises before applying for jobs as a junior developer?",MooiDaedalus,6,2,0.63

My boss and another team lead (who was promoted from our team) keep digging and chatting. I just said ""yep. I said I'll look into it ASAP.""

Again it was a half point story a week out from release, EXTREMELY low priority.


About 15 mins later I got to digging and fixed the problem. (The actual problem is in comments )

My boss and I get on a meeting to talk about something else and he needed to share his screen. Well he showed his slack which was him talking crap about me to that other team lead.

He apologized and said some bs stuff about learning how not to vent to others, etc.

71,Actual DOD (GS payscale) jobs vs DOD Contractor jobs,11uq323,"So people here love bashing the DoD sector, not going to argue against it bc most seem like valid arguments to me. And barring any moral arguments here for now…

But does anyone know if the government jobs (GS payscale) in agencies under the DoD such as civilians working as GS paid employees for military branches do the exact same legacy code stuff? Or is it posible they are doing the cool things and breaking into new territory(still underpaid) but at-least doing something worth being passionate about beyond maintaining legacy code? 

With all the pushes for modernization, one has to wonder where the modern stack is hiding in R&D department for these systems. 

The Airforce and Navy and Marines all have grandiose claims of DoD modernization using a civilian workforce - Airforce is getting heavy into internal software development via “Software Engineering Groups” and even startup style shops called “software factories” around the country, with big pushes towards DevSecOps and lifecycles outside of “waterfall”.  Seems like they are using things like rust, go, Python, Javascript instead of maintaining legacy C/C++. 

…Yet I hear nothing of it here lol here is a link for reference of the different software factories

TL;DR is DOD civilian GS jobs the same as dod contractors just maintaining legacy code or are the last few years push towards new things making it different? See Airforce civilian software factories link for reference.",Sorry_Minute_2734,4,5,0.78

73,How much would quitting my first job after 2 months hurt my prospects,11uovdp,"I'm self taught in programming and two months ago I got a QA automation job. At work I use Java, which is the language I'm most familiar with. Before this I did tech support.  Honestly, I hate my job. I work in fintech, and I have zero sense of what good my job actually does for society, since I have zero sense what good stock trading does, I tried to understand but still it just seems so vague and debatable in what good it does. I feel extremely unmotivated to do the work, and when I do do the work, I feel horrible afterwards, get a headache, or a stomachache. The reason I took the job is I was kinda desperate to leave my tech support job because I was very overworked and bored, but honestly I preferred that job, since it actually gave me some purpose. And my old boss told me I can reach out to him if things ever get rough for me. 

I'm leaning heavily towards just quitting this QA job this Monday. But I'm scared this would make it very difficult to break into CS again, since now I would have a red flag on my resume. 

I still live with my parents and I have a decent amount of personal savings, so it's not like my life depends on it, and I think I could go back to my old decently paying job if I end up jobless for months, in the meantime I could really double down on learning data structures and algorithms and other gaps in CS knowledge I have as a self taught person, and focus on getting a job that doesn't make me miserable, if my red flags don't end up too big.

So I have been studying front end development for the past 6 months and it’s been great! I love it and I wish I discovered it sooner!!

My only issue is that the front end dev entry roles in London are paying between 23-25k. For me this is very very low especially with the cost of living crisis and also the fact that I live in London. I understand that the salary would increase after maybe a few years but I don’t think I would be able to finance myself with that amount untill then. If anyone has any tips on what I could do to fasten the process so that I can be making decent money at least , that would be great!

So I was thinking, what if there are other tech roles I could do which doesn’t have such a low salary for entry, using the front end skills I have gained. 

Does anyone know roles (other than IT support desk) which I could do?

&#x200B;

I have been with a small but very active company for the past 5 years.  I got hired before I even finished an associates degree and never finished it.  I have always delivered on time and have done some really amazing things.  Building entire applications from scratch and integrating new ideas into existing software (often on my own and alone).  Going to customer sites to debug and fix on the spot, Given an idea and told to make it work without proper planning.  Getting things done in tight deadlines.  But that's just how the company is and has been normal given I got hired here as my first interview into the field. They gave me senior software engineer title this year.  

Here's the kicker, I never really thought I was a particularly good programmer.  I sometimes struggle with structuring my program and often times can't see the bigger picture until it's to late and I'm stuck rewriting code.  I make a decent salary and anyone that leaves our company moves on to get a 30k a year pay increase (often after a single year or two).  They say how much easier the work is and I've always been scared to leave due to my personal life and needing something stable in it for one reason or another.

   We just hired a new hire and when talking to him he stated how I could easily get a senior position at a bigger company and it blew my mind.  He put into perspective that the way we work is NOT how big companies work.  In big companies they have an idea, draw it out, get exactly what they want you to do before it ever reaches a programmer.  He said that tasks I can do in days they give programmers weeks to do at big companies.  He says that my lack of education means nothing compared to the experience I have from working at this company with the tasks I've been given.

79,First job as a Software Engineer: Electronic Warfare or Finance Industry?,11ujxmn,"Hello guys, I am a fresh graduate in Engineering and I am looking for my first  job as a Software Engineer. I have two main offers, one in the field of the Electronic Warfare (not in a big defense contractor, but it is still a big company of 1000 people) and one in a Banking & Finance (in a company from the ION group). In the defense company I would work as a software engineer for Electronic Warfare simulations, while in the finance company I would have the opportunity to work in the field of Trading and Execution, Compliance and Risk management in the Finance sector (the company is actually more focused on the latter two rather than trading).

So I am very confused, and I don't know what to choose (the pay is more or less the same). Indeed, while the work in the Electronic Warfare company seems to be very technical and challenging, I am  afraid that I would not bring home any relevant skill useful in other sectors. On the other side, working in the ION group would help me to understand better the Financial industry, which is always a plus point, and I would acquire more transversal skills. Nevertheless, the attention to innovation, to coding and training seems to be less present here than the defense company (which is a rarity). Moreover, the finance company has some bad reviews on Glassdor while the defense company is way better in this regard and also have some certification as ""Great Place to Work"".

Considering that I do not plan to work in either of them for more than 3/4 years, what should I prefer? I don't know anything about Electronic Warfare. It seems a lucrative business, and it will also enhance my C/C++ coding skills, but I don't understand how there exist such a big market behind ""radars"". On the other hand, the Finance Industry is always a secure choice, but I feel like the company I would go is not the ""top-notch"" in the field and there is so much competition there.

I don't have a degree related to IT whatsoever, and I landed this job due to my prior knowledge of the services our platform offers. They figured that training IT professionals on the service offered would be just as much work as training someone from the industry on software support, so they were open to either. 

I recently started specializing in integration support issues, I'm on a plan to move to Senior Support this summer & my manager spoke with me about a potential API Integration Specialist career path. I spoke with one of our Integration Specialists who thought this was a great idea as they need to grow their team. Here's the thing, I'm pretty sure he assumed I have a stronger IT/CS background than I actually do because he shared a bunch our clients API pages to so that I could familiarize myself with them, told me to brush up on REST/RESTFUL API testing, JSON, XML & to start playing around with Postman. The problem is that I have zero idea where to even start because I don't know how any of this stuff works. I'm also feeling a bit out of my league because the Integration Specialist I spoke with has a Masters in CS & here I am with diddly squat that relates education wise.

But the thing is, I really want to do this and I have 6 months at the very minimum before I'd need to start making any moves to transition to the Integrations team. So I started doing some research and the consensus was that I should really get the fundamentals of JS/HTML/CSS down before I start with XML, studying REST/RESTFUL APIS & messing around with Postman/JSON. I've started Udemys JavaScript 0-Expert course and I'm  planning to move to the rest once I've got the fundamentals down.

I recently completed  iOS certificate program taught by Meta. It was huge and it took me 7 months to complete. But I understand that I simply wasted my time and  money pursuing this useless certificate. It won’t help in my situation.

It is not that I was having a good time or relaxed being through all this  frustrating nonsense. I worked hard for nothing, and still working hard.  I have planned, created, modified, got through month of hoops fighting  with AppStore to release the app for that startup for nothing in return.  I completed paid certification for nothing in return other than more  knowledge which now feels unnecessary for some reason. Sometimes I feel  completely broken. I contemplate leaving tech completely every other  week when I get hit by another wall of desperation.

To sum this all up, I'm considering some entry-level QA job as a possible way forward. Is this even a good idea or am I going to hit the same wall again with another bad decision?

Every week it seems like this guy manages to merge something that breaks shit, and I end up being the one who finds it and has to take time to fix it.

I'm at the point now where I can't trust anything this guy puts out. I've at least got him to stop putting up 70+ file PRs but somehow bugs are still getting through.

I'm currently in the process of trying to make our tests more readable and maintainable since currently they are extremely difficult to change (guess who wrote them) but in the mean time I feel like I have to put each PR of his under a microscope if it touches any critical code paths. He also rewrote one of our APIs a few months ago but it now is slower and less performant and we are having to go back and try to rework things to be more performant.

What's frustrating about this is he's supposed to be a Senior level engineer. Every week i get pulled off of sprint work to fix this guy's bugs or performance issues he introduced and it's really starting to get to me.

And maybe part of this is on me, for not knowing the system well enough at first and thinking his changes seemed OK at a glance when I was still ramping up.

This sprint I was really hoping to work on some new functionality and architecting a new service but of course that got pulled out to work on API performance issues that were introduced by my coworker a few months ago.

Our software architect is aware of this guy's shoddy work and I've vented to him a few times but it doesn't change the fact that I still have to spend time cleaning up after him. Which inevitably leads to me feeling incredibly frustrated and demotivated. Our APIs are used by other teams in our org and it's embarrassing that every week someone had a new bug to report and inevitably the git blame points back to him nearly every time without fail.

120,Need Career Advice,11u1wse,"Hello, everyone. I'm writing this in hopes of receiving some constructive advice on my situation and future in the industry.

Quick background: I'm graduating remotely in two months with my master's in CS, but my bachelor's was in Computer Engineering, so I understand low-level and embedded systems a bit as well as circuitry. I found ARM and PicoBlaze Assembly extremely easy, but C++ rather difficult since I was self-taught and skipped C++ courses in college. I enjoy Python nowadays and am trying to break into Robotics or AI. I have one year of experience at a Fortune 500 company in a Firmware Validation role, but it's totally unrelated to what I'd like to pursue. I recently started an Android app project where I plan to learn Firebase and Tensorflow for Computer Vision. I don't have much experience with Computer Vision, but in my grad program I have taken 2 ML courses, advanced algorithms, and graph data mining. I have nearly 2 years of experience leading teams in school projects and at previous jobs. I can read some Japanese and Spanish, as well as understand + speak even more. Additionally, I'm currently living in Japan and waiting for my wife's spouse visa to be processed before moving back to the US, but was hoping I could use a job offer as a means of visa expedition for her.

My questions are:

1) Will a company be willing to hire me remotely and let me begin work overseas before moving back to the states if I kept my US bank account and don't plan on remitting money? I figured they might be able to hire me based on my previous state of residency?

2) With a master's degree and 1 year of professional experience, do I qualify for a mid-senior level role? If so, would that be a Senior, Staff, or Principal Engineering position?

3) If I don't feel confident in my desired role, but really want to work at the company, what route would you recommend?

4) I can't seem to get interviews, but I've updated my resume to be ATS-friendly and since I have many years of projects and a diverse set of skills, it is now 2 pages long. Any advice on getting a recruiter to notice me?

5) I recently created a portfolio website. I have so many programs I wrote in school, but only a few personal projects. Should I keep my GitHub to relevant/impressive projects or upload everything?

6) With all of the big tech layoffs recently, what's the general consensus in the industry as far as what companies are stable and/or easy to get a job at?

7) I feel like there's so much more depth to my personality, leadership skills, and experience than I can fit on my resume. However, I'm having trouble getting an interview. Any recommendations for how I can showcase my entire self beyond a resume?

8) I really want to work remotely because that's what I've become accustomed to, I know where I want to live, and my wife is not comfortable being alone in the US at first with her broken English and inability to drive (she's never owned a car). Any tips on appealing to companies for remote positions? (I noticed most remote positions are mid-senior level)

9) Has anyone used a job agency to assist in finding you a job? Did it work? Was it expensive? Is it worth it?

10) I read that levels.fyi can negotiate offers of ~$30k+ on top of original offers. Is this a legit service?

127,AI/ML Startup or Famous Non-tech Company for Summer internship? Struggling to Choose,11tzw3i,"Hello! I am very fortunate that I have two offers for the coming summer and I am struggling to choose, and I would like to hear what others think of this. The first option is an internship with a famous company (but their product is not tech) and the second option is an AI/ML startup. I'm currently pursuing my bachelors in CS, and AI/ML is the CS field I want to go into after I graduate; I've heard that it is very difficult to get roles in that field without any grad school, so I feel very fortunate to have this opportunity. I'll list some points about each role that might inform your advice if you have any:

**Option 1: Big Non-tech company**

* \~$40/hr and housing is covered
* On-site in Bay Area
* Some friends from college would also be doing it with me
* It's a company everyone has heard of
* The company's product is not really tech related - ofc they use tech since it's 2023, but I don't even know what my work would involve (could very well be 'go work on the website')
* Someone told me it might look better on a resume, since its a big name and its bay area
* I've already 'accepted' this offer bc it presented itself in November, vs the other just recently

**Option 2: AI/ML Startup**

* \~$30/hr
* Remote (which I think I prefer)
* I am currently working with them this Spring so I'm familiar with the managers and the tech used
* It's in AI/ML, which is what I want to do for my career
* It's a startup which is less 'secure', but I don't get the feeling they'll crash and burn soon (they've gained a few hundred-thousand users since I joined them a couple months ago)
* They have a sort of hands-off management style and trust me to get work done on my own which I like bc it forces me to problem solve and learn more things on my own
* They've given the implication that they're interested in continuing to work with me in the future/post-grad

129,So I overslept my last 2 daily standup meetings and it seems like my manager did not notice or just did not care/mention it? A bit scared idk,11tzstw,"TLDR: junior dev overslept 2 standups in a row. Manager has said nothing and seems like he hasn't noticed. Very worried he has and will pip me.

I'm a junior dev currently wfh and I've been at this company for about 3.5 months. This is not a normal occurrence at all I am always at standup but yes I've been an idiot and overslept past today's and yesterday's (well for yesterday I missed the entire standup and today I was only in it for the final 3 minutes of a 15 minute standup). 

Our current standups for the past 3 weeks, since we got our new manager, have been 15 minutes with about 12-15 people and we no longer do individual updates like we did under our previous managers standups so most standups I do not speak at all (I really only speak if I need something or have a blocker) especially now that there is this super heavy focus on this migration project and the more senior developers are far more important for that. 

I've only every missed standup once before these past 2 days which was about 3 months ago, when I had just joined the company, and I had overslept. Since my old manager did make us all do individual updates he did notice that I was not there and he emailed me on outlook, called me multiple times on teams, and called me on my personal phone number to reach out. When I finally woke up I told him I had had painful headaches that morning so I was unable to attend and I took PTO for the 2 hours I wasn't online as requested by the old manager. Since then I haven't missed standup before the last 2 days 

I have actually communicated with my current manager both today and yesterday for things not related to standup (like gaining access to a certain database to modify a stored procedure and discussing a bug I am working on) and it has been just a normal conversation with me missing standup not being brought up at all. Like it seems like he did not notice or does not particularly care. Normally if I missed something he does let me know immediately (like 2 weeks ago I forgot to submit my timesheet on time so he let me know) but he hasn't mentioned anything at all or asked me to take PTO or use any flex hours for missing standup

We have one on ones every Wednesday and last one on one he just asked me how I was doing, wanted to check in cause I'm still relatively new (and I have not been properly onboarded yet since my old manager forgot and my new manager is either too busy or also forgot after promising to start onboarding me about a few weeks ago this company is a chaotic mess) and it was a normal Convo. I have never been called out for performance or discipline/conduct yet or received any warning yet in fact I have been previously praised for performance and communication 

Idk I'm just hyperworried about getting PIPed at the next one on one with my current manager due to this (plus the fact that I'm kinda taking longer than expected on this bug and not getting much help from senior devs cause they're all busy. Plus I feel like compared to all other devs I do less work esp cause they are far more important for this new migration project).",miMinaminoManeMinoMo,27,14,0.67

Most of my uni life passed during the pandemic and I could hardly learn anything in classes, with my peers, or my professors (they reaally sucked). So I couldn't rly gain any programming skills apart from basic html/css and a few attempts at basic discord bots in python.

I then went on to pursue a course for Advanced Java including JSP, JDBC, JSTL, Servlet, Hivernate, MVC, Spring, etc.

I had been applying for a while, and couldn't get any replies. Some who did reply would pay too low (and in a completely different language), and felt overall toxic.

I finally got an offer from a company that paid a decent amount, although low but I just wanted to start my career. It included 2.5 years of a service agreement including 6 months of prior training beginning from HTML/CSS, to JavaScript, to Core Java, Spring etc etc.

Sounds cool, right? The catch however is, 4 days into the training I get to know that the ""Java"" role they'll be making us work with is Liferay, instead of Spring, which most Java backend guys are supposed to work with right?

I'm the lead React developer at a company two months into a React project engineered from the ground up with proper patterning.

One problem. My boss is hellbent on the CSS grid system. He's realized lately that I haven't implemented CSS grid to lay the architecture of our React website and is now quite pissed. He thinks that the grid system is a quintessential pattern that we've neglected and that I'm going to run this website into the ground, and I can't convince him he's wrong. His main worries are that it will affect the responsivity of our website---mainly brought on by the fact that I haven't implemented responsive components yet in favor of prioritizing some behind-the-scenes items.

I'm sure he'll come around in time, once he actually **sees** that this will be responsive.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hello all,

I know this will strengthen of the stigma of self-learners ruin the industry but please let me explain.

I have worked in IT and started as Service Desk Support and moved up to Technical Support Specialist for the software that are used by customers so I used JavaScript mainly to identify issues. I was looking for work and saw an opportunity for Junior role and passed the interview and got hired.

I was very clear with my hiring manager that I would not call myself a developer and I am lacking in a lot of areas and he said ""We will see your technical expertise with the homework that we will assign"" so I passed it and they were very pleased.

Now I started working I took over a project that around 10k lines of code and it is 80 percent done. The previous developer left the company and I was tasked to finish this project. This project has been going on since 2021 (I looked at the initial documentation).

The issue is I have never even wrote a project that was over 300 lines. I was not told that I need to know CSS,HTML because this project is GAS web App. I am trying to understand the codebase but everything is referring to another function or another variable that was created in another file. There were 30/40 files that was in source file (GAS sucks with foldering system so I started using CLASP to utilize VSCode) 15 of these files have comments on the beginning that says //DEPRECATED and I do not know why they are still here and I am afraid to touch them.

I feel like this is a bit unfair( Yes, I am aware I am being a whiny person) The previous dev had 2 years of time to develop and talk with the customer (It is a web app to be used internally so customer is my colleague actually) I did not have any of those perks. I am struggling to understand what the code does. I feel that trying to understand other's code is much harder writing it on your own.

I was stupid to stay quiet because I was afraid to be seen as a stupid person so 3 months have passed. I really don't know what to do. I got stuck with a codeblock and asked senior colleague. The answer was really vague. He told me that this code should work but does not know why it gives an error in the console.

I am really open to any ideas and suggestions. You can downvote this post but I would be really glad for and CONSTRUCTIVE critism to come through other side as a stronger developer. Thank you very much for reading this long post. IF need be, I can provide more information except personal ones.

Besides work I contribute to a variety of open source projects which range a lot of fields. I also do my own projects. All of this is just because I like programming and making things. But the thing is the fields differ a lot. **Some areas I am involved in...**

&#x200B;

*  I am a top contributor to a random generation library in Rust
* I work professionally on backends, data engineering, and devops.
* I build my own microcontrollers (motion sensor, temperature displays, etc)
* I am a maintainer for a dotenv linter.
* I've contributed a few bug fixes to a game engine library (Bevy)

Do others feel the same? Am I really stunting my growth by going for this breadth approach? I really like to work in Rust + Python, sometimes C.

Should I be expecting a higher-than-average salary for a junior developer role (relative to where I live) considering that I am expected to specialize in obscure low-code technologies that do not have as much overlap with regular developer roles, therefore it makes me less employable for those roles later on?

Someone who oversees the development team, and is also responsible for assuring the product is meeting it’s goals (time/defect ratio/velocity of completed work). 

What would be some tips or better to say the correct steps to take to ensure my success at becoming a Lead Engineer? I know I am asking for a cookie cutter answer with something that can’t be baked. But knowledge is power and I want to see what you all might think. What are some principles that I should be sure to follow? Any books, articles, or other resources that helped you along your journey? Is it just experience and exposure to the applications? Should I make sure I understand computer architecture? 

I know that there are many great engineers that have came before me, so help me not reinvent the wheel.

I'm in third-year CS taking a course about modern software engineering.

I feel like I'm spending 90% of my time in meetings and writing notes, goals, retrospectives, all this stuff related to Scrum. I think it's a meaningless waste of time. I'm not engineering anything.

We were taught the purpose of Scrum: develop the application so that it can be deployed as a product at any checkpoint. To me that's just a different way of saying ""rush developers to squeeze the most out of a product with the little time that they have so that the company can make as much profit as soon as possible.""

Articles about developer burnout and wasteful meetings only affirm my beliefs. I get that the world operates on working products, businesses want to optimize and eliminate problems. That's always been the case. I want to work for a company where I have the time and space to be creative, to think about different approaches, backtrack and redesign. I want time to brainstorm with my coworkers without rushing to complete something just because we said we would two weeks ago. I want breathing space, I want the time needed to craft a product with thought and care.

The client isn't always right. Sometimes the client needs to be patient. Good things take time. Daily standups waste time. It's all a load of corporate bullshit and I wish this wasn't the kind of culture I was heading into.",This_Dying_Soul,19,0,0.3

I passed when I was healthy, and spent most of my time just working on personal projects instead of uni related things, especially since the work took very little time and felt like I was just jumping through hoops. I've won a few CTFs and am mostly interested in cyber security and networking.  

I've been working  a new job as a ""network engineer"" for about half a year, it's my first real job.  Since I've started, I've been given full responsibility of the network at this company of around 50 people.  I am writing ansible scripts for the vyos routers I deployed, and have to maintain the pfsense routers that are configured in the most.... interesting.... ways and still need to exist for existing things that have yet to be migrated.  I'm maintaining most of the servers in the rack and have been the one deploying them, securing them, networking them, and documenting it.  Existing servers are Xen based, with some esxi servers, and I'm deploying servers using libvirt on gentoo.  I've also made a passbolt server for the team that is used heavily, prior, we just used one password for everything.  I'm also currently having to write custom software to wrap the entire process our department mostly relies on, because the software we have to use is super shaky and things have been falling through the cracks a lot, something that has been a growing issue since before I joined.  On top of this, I have to be on call for 40 hours out of the week, something that I will apparently not have to do any more if the department grows, but for the time being, is a requirement.

I feel like this is a lot of work/responsibility and my total pay is below 60k, and I live in a major city in the US.  I feel I'm providing a ton of value, but not really being paid well, and I it was a real pain even getting a job because I didn't have a degree, or other work experience despite being more than qualified.  I'm the only one at the company that seems capable of doing this networking/sysadmin work, and on top of that, these are all tasks I've taken for myself. Nobody is telling me do do this stuff, I just see what is currently in place needs improvement, and I've been very successful in integrating new things.  Within a month of working there, I was able to set up a new VPN, and supporting things which allowed the entire team to work from home, something that we leverage heavily now.

174,Is it normal for US based companies to lowball remote senior hires from EU that much?,11tb92k,"Just had this weird experience:

Applied to a US based company as a remote senior android dev. 

Told them my rate was 55usd/hour. 

Their internal recruiter who is based in Poland told me that their budget is max 45 usd/hour max for a senior role. 

I was like ok maybe its worth a shot.

Passed the initial interview, did the technical interview, seemed like I did really great.

Today I receive an offer from that recruiter of 30 usd/hour. Feedback was that Im senior in some areas but in most of them Im a ""really strong mid level"" so they cant offer senior rate for me. Right now Im thinking of how to respond to that.

What is this? Seniors are expected to know everything 100 percent? Every senior I worked with usually specializes in 2-3 areas and looks up others as he goes. I guess shes trying to lowball me or something.

To be honest this is hilarious for me. If I wanted I could land a contracting gig with same 30usd/hour in my city 5 miles away from my home (Im based in Latvia, capital city Riga). But this is US based company so what the heck? Am I being gaslighted? Or is this rate the new normal?

For reference, I'm a college freshman probably graduating in 2026. Currently, GPT4 is out and it can take in \~8192 tokens (much bigger input size) allowing it to take in documentation or advanced and really elaborate queries to make it write much better code than ChatGPT used to a few days ago. This means that if your specification is elaborate enough, it can actually write decent code. Now obviously it can only write code based on its data (whether it be the data OpenAI fed it or the query itself) so it can't do anything it does not have information about but isn't this exactly what junior engineers do anyway?

Obviously, AI is only going to get better from here, and if GPT4 is already not that far off from being equal to a junior engineer then by the time I graduate won't it be very possible that it becomes equal or better than most junior engineers?

For starters, I am an older graduate, turning thirty next week actually, and so throughout college I had to work full time. I worked in retail and restaurants to support myself. Consequently, I didn’t ever get an internship, and work sometimes interfered with my studies. My gpa was only around 2.3 after a long and complicated college career spanning from age 18-29.

I still put my work experience down for now, but am planning on taking it out…

As of now, since I’m out of school and have free time, I just apply everywhere I can, and decided to start some projects. My best class was web development with JavaScript, so I decided to learn reactjs, and I want to develop a MERN stack app to put on my resume. Right now I’m doing some react tutorials to get a feel for the framework and refresh from the class, since I took it a while ago… but I think the career path I want to go down is full stack development. I enjoy all aspects of it, designing ui/ux, coding server side logic, setting up and populating databases, I want the whole package. But obviously I’d take the first job I can land. 

So far I’ve had to turn a couple of interviews down because they required security clearances which I don’t want to deal with (am not eligible). I started applying in the beginning of February and have had 4 phone interviews so far. I haven’t had a technical interview yet, but I’m kind of terrified of them tbh. I do get emails from company’s like Synergystic, but it seems kind of scammy and maybe more of a last ditch effort kind of deal.

So I guess my questions boils down to this: is my plan… good? Am I going about this the wrong way? I look at the requirements for entry level jobs and I feel so unprepared from university. And I also know the job market is less than ideal at the moment (to put it lightly). I’m trying to not be too disheartened, as I’ve read about people on here who took 6-18 months to get a job post university, but it still feels like I was thrown into the deep end after just learning to swim.

200,Out of the field due to mental illness - what should I do?,11t1oo4,"Hi,

I worked as a software engineer for about two years then had to quit due to a severe mental illness. I was totally out of the loop due to it and have not kept up on CS topics or experience. 

I have a bachelors degree in CS but I got it in 2017. Now that my mental illness is becoming more managed, I am trying to get back into the field. However, obviously nobody will entertain my application because I have no recent experience.

I am prohibited from having a government clearance because of the mental illness, and unfortunately in my physical geographic area, most CS jobs are clearance jobs.

201,The Value of School Career Fairs for New Graduates,11t1lvm,"As a recent graduate, I successfully secured a entry-level position at a defense contractor because of my school's career fair. I had no prior internships or jobs that would fit this role either. Also I graduated with a 2.5 GPA. I worked on my resume and elevator pitch, then I made sure to follow up the next day via email. This secured me an interview. For some reason I don't see this suggested that much, if at all. This was the best advice I ever got (from my mom).

&#x200B;

 Just a heads up, career fairs offer more than just opportunities with defense contractors. At the one I attended, I also encountered construction companies, police departments, and other diverse employers. Interestingly, even construction companies reached out to me about IT positions, but I was specifically aiming for a defense contractor. While online applications are easy, they pit you against countless candidates globally. However, at career fairs, you only need to make a positive impression in person and then follow up via email. In fact, if I hadn't followed up with an email, I wouldn't have landed this job. I hope this advice proves useful, and I wish everyone the best :)",OPSEC-First,4,0,0.5

Now frontend is something that I have always enjoyed and I have hoped to become a frontend (or full-stack) developer. But then we brought up that even with the availability of Wordpress and other free tools for webpage creating, there's still a huge demand for frontend developers right now. So it's not like they would lose their jobs just because people can generate a nice webpage themselves using some online tools.

242,Internship Dilemma - College Freshman,11si2ug,"Hello, I am a first-year cs major and I am trying to decide what my strategy should be for internships. I feel pressured because I hear that internships make studying cs at uni worth it. At the moment my only skills are python and java. So I have a long way to go in terms of learning. Is it best for me to try to have a basic understanding of numerous skills in order to stack up a bunch of internships before graduating? Or should I focus on perfecting a set of skills and only try for internships where I could see myself working at that company or field?  


One of my professors recommended I take the second route while a lot of students I see usually follow the first approach. I am conflicted because I am not 100% certain what career I would like to pursue but I would like to keep as many doors open as possible. My thought process was that stacking internships would let me get past the resume stage whenever I find companies I would like to work at in the future. But now I am unsure.

243,Struggling as a fall 2022 grad,11sh189,"Just a heads up this is gonna be the standard ""job market is so ass rn and I'm giving up"" cry for help that you've probably heard enough of lol. Just want to get it off my chest I suppose.

I am going through quite possibly the most discouraging time of my life at the moment. Throughout undergrad I slacked off and just didn't apply myself as much as I should have. I didn't really feel passionate about software engineering until around senior year which is right around when things started to go downhill, just my luck.

As it stands, I graduated fall 2022 with 0 internships and have been feeling completely lost. Even if I do somehow build a decent portfolio of projects, I then have to face a competitive, over-saturated junior dev job market.

I have applied to startups, government jobs, looked into contracts, anything you can think of to get my foot in the door, but nothing. When I was applying to new grad roles last fall, I got a couple bites, but since those roles have been filled I have not heard back from anyone. I apply to around 10 roles a day on average. I have considered grad school but it's just too expensive for me and my family.

I no longer qualify for new grad roles, which means I now have to go for roles that require 2+ YOE.

I am grinding Leetcode everyday and just trying to pick up new tools (React/Express) in the meantime to build projects so I keep my mind sharp, but it's getting super discouraging.

I know that my lack of internship and professional experience is my fault for not dedicating myself in undergrad, but it honestly feels like I will never land a software engineering role at all and I'm terrified that I'm gonna have to let my degree go to waste and find something else.

I will try my best to keep trudging along and building projects/grinding Leetcode, but is there any hope for me? Do I just have to wait out this bad market? Recent news about SVB just added onto my anxiety rip

248,I Have no Idea How to Conduct Myself as a Professional,11sg5l8,"Long story short here's what happened to me to today.

I showed up to the office late by over half an hour (despite living across the street from my office I am late more than not) I arrived to find my boss' boss taking up the seat next to mine. The first half of the day I was met with awkward silence every time our eyes met. After the third time this happened, I figured he noticed I was late and I figured I upset him.

I thought I'd break the silence by taking to him about an email he sent out this morning. He had made some last minute requirements to some work my team was doing. I thought I'd show him what I've been working on and get his feedback on it.

He had a lot of criticisms  & asked several questions I didn't know how to answer. The entire time I was talking to him I had the subtle feeling that my coworkers near by were upset by the discussion they were hearing.

After speaking to my boss' boss I PM'd one of my team members. I asked him if he over heard the conversation & apologized saying I was sorry if I miscommunicated anything (I had no idea why I was getting blood stares from everyone). My coworker responded by talking shop for a few minutes before explicitly telling me to keep talks with my boss' boss as short as possible and to not talk to him if I don't have to.

When my other team members left for the day they said 'goodbye' to me, but they seemed to hesitate before doing so.

I feel like I'm socially impaired or something. Among software developers my lack of professionalism is pissing people off.

Am I king of the autists or something?

Fuck me. What do I need to do to improve? Am I making too big a deal of this?

I graduated from Industrial Engineering (undergrad) in May 2020. In the last 2 years of my university education, I have spent a lot of my free time to learn Data Science/Machine Learning on my own.

In September 2020, I started a job as a contractor in Boston. My title was 'Associate Engineer' but I was dealing with Data Science/Machine Learning in my job. I was paid $36.5/hour and I didn't have any PTO, stock, bonus, and I was paying half of my health insurance.

In March 2022, I got promoted to Data Scientist position. This was still contractor position and my salary was increased to $50/hour. 

Today is March 2023 and I am still working as a Contractor - Data Scientist in the same company. I still do not have any PTO, stock, bonus, and I am still paying half of my insurance. This means that my total compensation is currently $104,000/year. And I am working in this company for 2.5 years on Data Science/Machine Learning.

When I look at what the total compensations of Data Scientists who have similar amount of experience with me and who are working in Boston (at Glassdoor, levels.fyi), I feel like I am treated as a cheap work source but I cannot be sure if this is really the case since I guess getting a raise in the same company takes relatively a long time.

257,"Getting super annoyed at my CEO's (and general management's) obsession with ChatGPT and ""generative"" AI... Anyone else?",11sd631,"This ended up sounding more like a rant so I apologize in advance. Please skip if you're not up for that.

I'm a MLE for a startup. I've done research in ML/NLP in grad school and am also currently doing research. My CEO also (supposedly) has an AI background but can't stop talking about ""how amazing"" ChatGPT and other ""generative"" AI is (I use double quotations for ""generative"" because I think it's a misnomer, but that's for a separate conversation).

That's fine. Again, as someone who also does research in AI I think the state of generation models is remarkable. The problem is that my CEO (and other management) keeps thinking that we could implement ChatGPT and co. into our business without really thinking about it.

A typical conversation that I have at least thrice a week goes something like this:

```
CEO: Why aren't we using ChatGPT?
Me: Well I don't think that we really have any use cases for it and it'd be too expensive to run.
CEO: Well how about we do something like automatic labeling for our data?
Me: We already have trained models to do that. We could just use those and manually inspect the outputs.
CEO: How about we do something like product recommendation through text generation?
Me: There are tons of open source text generation models that do that without having to be ChatGPT.
CEO: You're being too close-minded. It's so hard to communicate with you.
Me: Um okay.
```

What's funny is that my CEO supposedly went to grad school at one of the best technical universities in my school and has a background in AI.

I thought my Twitter and LinkedIn feed being flooded with ChatGPT was bad enough, but having to deal with these questions that the answers are clear to with just a tiny bit of thinking is starting to really irk me...

**Edit**

It's a little funny. You can tell who's actually studied about or knows about AI just from the types of comments they're making. Anyone who's serious about AI knows to give credit where credit's due, but not to take it too seriously.

258,Non-software engineer apparently appointed my supervisor: advice needed on how to exit gracefully,11sc8lr,"I started in my first junior role as software engineer in a corporate company. I'd had some previous experience going in and even though I was apprehensive in the first few days, it turns out that the technical challenge hasn't been the problem but the co-worker who wrote a lot of the source code of the application I have to rewrite. He's not a software engineer at all but did well in that he learned to program on the side and built out the development application using jupyter notebooks for this department while they had nobody else before I joined. Sadly, that's the end of the positive. I was hired to make it production-ready.

Turns out, this guy had been mandated as my supervisor (like from day 1) even though he knows far less than me about software engineering. The problem is he has been making life a hassle for me due to just being jealous that I've been getting the work done well and quickly without a fuss. I've shown him respect but he is deeply insecure and none of that is my making. I really tried to make it work and get him on board but he is waiting for me to fail on something.

When it was implied that he has a supervisory role for the first time today after I brought up an issue I had experienced with said person, I told the boss that a supervisor needs to know more than the supervisee and it didn't go down well. I've kinda burned a bridge there I think. There was just no other way to say it as the boss was not going to do anything about the disruptions.

1.) No security clearance. Several entry level jobs where i fit the criteria require clearance 

2.) Little experience. I have less than a year (4 months) experience in the tech field as a Cyber Security Engineer intern. 

3.) Unfamiliarity with common languages, technologies, and frameworks.  I know about as much as I was taught in university, so I don't even know common programming languages like Java or c#.

There's probably more but I don't what they are. I can understand how number 3 can be fixed, but in what manner?

I have been diving into coding for 1.5 years rn. I am slow as I am doing it on the side. But I decided to make a career shift rn as I think I am not that far from being able to land a Junior Web Dev Job.  
I am 17 by the way. Here is what I have done:  
\- I finished a good amount of mini courses about HTML,CSS,JS,Python,CS.  
\- I finished 70% of a course on Codecademy called (Web Development).  
\- I finished a ZTM Course in which I built 20 interesting projects.  
\- I have a good idea of JS, HTML, CSS. I even learnt some advanced techniques like ITCSS.  
\- I know a bit of info about DS&Algorthms.

Where to now? I am super sick of courses yet I know I still need to learn about backend, React, TS, advanced Git and version control, and make some projects.  


What I would really wish is one final course that teaches me all the above mentioned skills. Why that? Because since I young, I don't have too much money to spend on subscriptions such as Codecademy's. And many courses all teaching only one concept.

271,"Considering getting into this field, I have a couple questions/misconceptions I’d like to get cleared up",11sa7e3,"I’m 19, at 18 years old I moved to nashville to pursue a music career. Music is a huge part of my life and I seriously could not live without it. However, in the music business it’s extremely hard to make even a livable wage. The sky is the limit but it’s so hard to get there and I’m kind of tired of going to bed every night wondering how I’ll be able to pay my rent and even eat. The money is jus weird in general and I might make 5 grand in a month or 0. There’s just no financial security for me and it’s stressful. Nashville is also really expensive. 

So I started looking on indeed for some steadier income jobs related to music. And a lot of the things I saw had to do with audio related programming for video game companies.

I had a friend of mine who dabbles in this stuff show me how he coded a website and I found it really interesting. 

So these two things have really made me consider getting into it. I love music but I also love not being stressed out so if I could have a career in this, and do music when I have time that would be ideal. 

So here’s the questions:

Is the pay really as good as I see on places like indeed, and videos? (Usually between 100-200 grand in salary is what I’m told). I’m under the impression that starting out you can make 50-90 grand depending on the company and you can quickly work your way up. 

What does the average week look like? Is it 9-5 M-F? Like I said I’d still like to have a little time for music. And work towards that at least a LITTLE bit because at any moment it can blow up. And what does the title “software dev” entail as your day to day “activities” at work? 

Is this industry more “one-off” gigs or is there security in a company? 

The music industry as well as most other industries have moved away from requiring a degree from a university, is that a safe assumption for this as well? (Obviously there are outlier companies but I’m talking as a whole)

If so, a coding boot camp seems like the way to go, so what are some credible camps that I should look into? 

What are the chances of landing a good paying secure job right out of a camp? I see alot them advertised that you don’t pay tuition until you get a job but I’m a little skeptical of that. 

These are my questions, and if y’all have any other things that I should consider please let me know

Working with analog gear in the music industry, I’m pretty damn good at problem solving in high stress environments. 

At the end of the day I just want to provide financial security for myself and my family, and at face value this line of work seems to be that thing. And this stuff actually interests me.

277,I have a B.S. in Computer Science and graduated last year. Since getting laid off in December I have sent out around 700+ applications through job boards. Only one employer bothered to move forward with me before deciding against hiring me. Is the market really this bad or is it me?,11s6wkl,"I graduated with a 3.1 GPA from a decent public school. Moreover, I have 6 months of experience as a software development intern that I acquired at the end of my academic career. To add to that I was hired shortly after graduating and I worked there for approximately 4 months. However, as a result of a change in circumstances, I found myself needing to move back home to be with my parents.

""Luckily"" I managed to secure a fully remote role that paid more than the role I had been working at for four months in person. It seemed like a no-brainer so I took the job offer. At first, everything seemed great. I had regular weekly meetings with my manager and they always told me I was doing a great job and thanked me for my hard work. Despite that, the reason I say ""luckily"" is because 4 months after quitting my first job and moving 500 miles. I was laid off in a company-wide layoff from the remote role I quit for. They stated it was due to a refinancing deal that fell through which left them lacking cash flow.

This brings me to today where I have been applying daily for four months with nothing but a single interview to show for it. I don't understand what it is I am doing wrong. I suspect my disjointed work history is scaring off potential employers but I am not certain. I am an honest person and I don't like to lie, but I am starting to consider simply pretending I worked at 1 company for 8 months before being laid off instead of 2 companies for 4 months each. I want to work whether it is a remote, hybrid, or local role. Furthermore, I am okay with getting paid as low as 65,000 despite having been paid a whole lot more previously.

280,Recently unemployed dev. Need advice on learning roadmap for my next job,11s58bq,"I'm a self-taught novice/intermediate developer. I'm unemployed now, but my last job was pretty much an introduction to full-stack web development.

The focus of my job was breadth across the front and backends, rather than depth in any one area. I went into the job knowing little to nothing about web development. I learned a lot in my time there, but I don't feel like I truly became competent, or close to competent, in any one part of web development.

I've thought hard about what I need to do to land my next job, hopefully in web development, as that's the domain I've gotten professional experience in over the past year. I want to leverage that experience.

I have three avenues I believe I can travel over the next several months in terms of my learning, and would love people's feedback on them.

**Option 1: The Odin Project**

Focus all my attention on the [Odin Project, full-stack JavaScript curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript?). My web development fundamentals definitely need work and polishing, and I think this project will give me that.

**Option 2: Data Structures and Algorithms and LeetCode**

I have very little training/practice with data structures and algorithms. Seeing as how so many companies require leetcode-style tests as part of the interview process, doing this feels necessary. I would take a course on data structures and algorithms, then immediately jump into practicing LeetCode.

I'm not sure which is more important though... having solid web development skills as stated in Option 1, or having solid LeetCoding skills. I can only study one or the other (see more on this in option 3).

**Option 3: Both 1 and 2**

Do both options 1 and 2 at the same time. If time and resources weren't a consideration, I would choose this option. But my time and resources are limited, so this doesn't seem like the best option. Then again, maybe it's doable. I don't know and ideas on this are appreciated.",ShylotheCurious,13,4,0.71

Now I didn't realize it was a question directed towards me. (It was sort of open ended and I thought the project lead would pick it up.) 

So there was silence for 5-10 seconds before the project lead had just started to speak and the technical lead interjected calling my name to speak up. I clarifying by saying  ummm is this about the architecture, I'm not sure I understand the question""  Then my manager repeated it and I answered it and asked technical lead to pitch in.

Then a minute or two after that i was still on unmute and my phone started ringing, loud. Pretty sure everyone on the call heard it. I muted myself, at that point the manager had just started to thank everyone and wrapping things up, I dropped off about 10 seconds after my phone rang (it was an important sort of call and the meeting had run over) but before everyone could say bye.

I am employed. I've been on a job hunt since a little after the new year, but I've been somewhat picky and not really in a rush.

About a month ago, I started interviewing at Company A. I've done 3 interviews with people of varying levels of seniority, and most recently I've completed a small take home assignment I was given. All direct communication has been with a person from the company's HR department (scheduling interviews, etc). I would LOVE to work for Company A.

About a week and a half ago, I started interviewing with Company B. I think it would be a fine place to work, and have no reason to be concerned about the work environment or people I'm working with. Company B gave me a verbal offer on Monday, and were happy to give me a week to make my decision. 

After receiving this offer, I reached out to Company A to let them know I had an offer at another company, and I have a week to make a decision. I didn't mention any details aside from that, and simply asked if the team at Company A would be able to get a decision to me in this timeframe. This email was sent to the HR person I had been in communication with, the same day I submitted the take home assignment I mentioned.

I'm getting a little stressed with the clock ticking and not having heard back from Company A. I understand that sort of decision does not rest on the HR employee I've been communicating with, and I would assume they want to review the assignment I submitted.

On the other hand there are other days where when I finished my tasks I have nothing to do and I feel like I’m just staring at my screen or reading internal wikis for hours. My team does a careful job of assigning me easy tickets (basically grunt work to them because they know the process) that let me figure out the system, so it’s either I get it quickly and have nothing to do afterwards, or I don’t and I ask for help. And when I’m done and ask for more stuff it’s usually too difficult and I need guidance/to bother someone about it.


I have guilty if I just don’t do anything for most of the day. Sometimes like I have a single task left and my teammate has to walk me through it (specific procedure) and I have literally nothing to do until they’re free 2 hours later. At the same time my team and company always seem very busy. Even though WLB at my company and team is constantly praised by the employees I still feel bad if I don’t have like 8 or so hours of screen time even if I don’t do much.

I plan to be a Software Engineer and would love to pursue an internship opportunity that will prepare me for this role, however I have a counter offer which will make almost twice as much as a Data Analyst. I am having trouble deciding which offer to accept so my question is would I be better off taking on a position I don't have any interest in pursuing a career in and making more money or sticking to my career path and making less. Lets break down my two offers:

Offer 1: This offer is a Data Analyst Intern position for a very big Bank. I have been told that I will have the opportunity to work alongside the Tech team and we will be collecting data to train an AI. I am very interested in AI and the role sounds more like a Data Scientist/Engineer than an Analyst so I feel like I could just put that I was a Data Engineer on my resume. They are offering me around $40/hour. The only things really keeping me from choosing this position are the title of the role and the location. I plan to be a Software Engineer in the future and would love to have an experience that will prepare me for internships next Summer, and a Software Engineer title to put on my resume.

Offer 2: This offer if a Software Engineer Intern position for a less known Tech company. In this role I would be working alongside people who are Software Engineers and working on a Summer-long project specific to Software. The location of this internship is perfect and I believe I will get much more experience in the field I am interested in. The only downside is they are only offering me $22/hour compared to the $40/hour for the other position.

Which position will set me up better for my future? Will taking the Data Analyst role and having that on my resume hurt my chances at getting a better Software Engineering role next Summer? I am torn between the two options and can't decide.",Brilliant_Maximum328,4,0,0.33

- I am finishing up my PhD in Spain and would have to relocate
- i am a US citizen but have lived in EU for the last 15 yrs (moved when i was 16) 
- i do not know how to drive because EU has great public transport and have never needed it. 

Things i need advice on 

- How is the work life balance in California Bay Area ? 
- is the salary enough to live comfortably? Rent, extra expenses i would need to pay to live in Cali etc. (after doing some research, damn is California expensive in comparison) 
- can i get to work without a car? 
- Would it be difficult to relocate coming from Spain without much savings and the savings I have would maybe last me like a month at most 
- Would i be able to rent a small 1bd apartment from abroad or is that sketch?

I loved my job but I was really only tasked with HTML/CSS and various other things (CMS page updates for clients for example). I just got laid off and have about 2 months of severance but every opening I see wants way more technology than I have experience with.

309,Do you ever travel for work? Is it worth it at all?,11rwfbh,"My team is fully wfh but has been asked to travel onsite to a company event in a few months. It lasts a few days and is pretty much just the standard large group corporate meeting stuff.

I’m sure there will also be after-work ‘happy hour’ team events too, which I wouldn’t have a good excuse to skip, since I would’ve already travelled across the country to attend the event. Company headquarters are on the east coast, which is pretty far from me.

So, I have absolutely no intention of going unless they plan to pay me for travel time and all the extra hours I’d have to spend away from home. But I realize that’s probably not a smart thing to say to my boss, who probably has no control over the situation either, so I’ll turn it down in a more thoughtful way. I’m not really seeing the point of going, and it feels like if you travel to something like this, you’re giving 24hrs a day to your company instead of just 8.

Im somewhat new to this as it’s the first time it’s come up in my career…so my question is: how common is it for your company to ask you to travel? Do you ever go and do you ever feel like it’s worth it? If not, how was your refusal received?",that_ballerr,63,0,0.33
310,Mid-Career Change... Overseas,11rwdag,"I'm 33, have my bachelor's in Industrial engineering from Missouri S&T, and for 10 years have been doing lots of mechanical design and modelling and simulation, along with lots of industrial engineering/quality stuff. Have worked for Ford, Harley-Davidson, Hitachi, and others. 

Not quite 2 years ago, I got married to a girl from Spain, and due to the circumstances, we have been living in Spain since July 2021. When I moved, I knew zero Spanish and only had my passport and American marriage license. I now have a decent conversational and technical level of the language and have all my paperwork in order and am on my way to becoming a USA-Spain dual citizen.

Job market here is notoriously bad. I took the first even-sort-of-technical job I could find, which saw me being a waterjet machine technician, travelling Europe maintaining and repairing waterjets for a 25,000€ salary. After a year of that, I had a decent level of technical Spanish (driving a car with another tech that is native for 8 hours a day will do that) so I jumped to an engineering job working for a solar panel systems company. I am earning a 35,000€ salary here, which is considered very good.

Generally, I find engineering miserable, even moreso when you earn 1/3 of what you are used to and the Spanish office culture grinds you down. I did a deep dive into my university memories about ""which classes did I actually enjoy most?"" and the answer was programming. My C++ classes were my favorite, but it never occurred to me that I could change course and go with Comp Sci (I was a first-gen college student, I made lots of mistakes).

My goal now is to find a fully remote developer (or similar) position that would allow me to work from either the USA or Spain, and the salary is not super important. Obviously, landing a USA-based gig with USA pay would be amazing, but I'm a simple man.

Another twist: A few weeks ago we found out my wife is pregnant. Accidental. So the ability to work from home would be double fantastic if I could change diapers between coding sessions.

Right now, I am learning Python and have Javascript next on the list, so I can work toward knowing a full stack. 

I just want to know from others who have had similar career changes or situations, am I headed in the right direction? Am I working on a solid stack? What advice would you give and what do you wish you knew before pivoting?",gremlinguy,0,4,0.83
311,Weird first round experience at a small company,11rwcva,"Recently interviewed with a small contracting company that raises so many hilarious red flags. Thought I'd share it here for laughs.

This company exclusively contracts for the government and works with various agencies. The first round is with the CEO and his ~~wife~~ HR manager.

Once introductions are done he starts talking about the training regimen I will be receiving from him and the various team members. I will be highly trained to wear multiple hats unlike the monkeys out there in big tech corps. Yea dude called developers at big corps monkeys. He elaborated by saying big corp devs only work on miniscule portions of the codebase with limited scope.

Dude then proceeded to gush on and on about his excellent bs detector, how he can sniff bs from a mile away so no one dares to cross him.

Next, he asked if I smoke (WTF). I asked if he is referring to smoke breaks, he said yea, but more importantly in meetings the smell of cigarettes is a no go (I guess smokers can't work office jobs then by his logic). Next he proceeded to school me on dress code, like how the data centers kick people out for not wearing business formal so employees should always turn up in suit and tie when trips to data centers are required.

Afterwards I was told I cannot be actively developing public facing side projects because whatever tech I'm trained on by this company is used for ultra top secret government projects. By that logic I cannot have public ReactJS projects on GitHub lol.

I was then grilled on whether I have any criminal convictions, bankruptcies or whatever because government.

Tbh the entire interview was weird and uncomfortable. This CEO also uses the word ""shit"" very liberally. Each time I answer something he would try to one up me. His ~~wife~~ HR manager would always interject with stupid questions for some reason.

This CEO also mentioned he is very busy and spends most of his day at meetings or reading technical white papers to know the latest tech and trends for his ultra confidential projects I guess. Yea dude just wanna brag he read technical papers.

How likely do you think they would be to allow a reduction in work days (with a pro-rata pay adjustment)?,11rvpju,"I currently work 4 day weeks and it’s honestly the best. I swear it’s making me more productive overall than if I was forced to log on that one extra day. Not to mention the wonders it did to my mental health.

When I was joining my current employer I was in quite a strong negotiating position because of a tricky embedded dev hiring landscape and already having another offer, so they agreed on a 4 day week contract with a 80% pay. It’s the kind of thing I see myself really struggle to give up, so they’ve probably bought themselves a higher likelihood of employee retention.

That said, the working culture is changing and I feel like more and more employers might be open to non-standard working arrangements. And so this got me thinking - how common are 4 day weeks amongst developers these days?

While I've been as open as possible when i was looking for a part-time, since the kind of job doesn't matter too much to me as long as it allows me to keep studying, it would be nice if it was something tech related, as i can get some experience under the belt and an idea of what it's actually like to work in this field 

 The problem I'm facing is that all of these entry positions are usually full time and require being proficient in 5+ coding languages with 2+ other languages added in where they dont ask proficiency but expect you to still be able to read/modify code in.

While I like the courses we've studied, most of the classes we've had so far are pure math and logic, the only coding language we've actually studied is java, with some touches of SQL and Lisp (though I have been studying python on the side, and i think i can code in both java and python with the same proficiency).

I've been mostly looking through Indeed, and I live in Italy.

My questions are:

\-  is this considered normal for those kind of positions? 

\- am I looking in the wrong place? 

\- should I try harder to find tech related jobs even if in a year or so there would be a period of internship where i would be guided by my University?

316,Could this be the possible reason of world wide lay-off?,11rsse1,"I personally think that these layoffs are happening because during the COVID-19 pandemic (which lasted for approximately 2.5 years), companies hired a lot of people due to the sudden surge in demand for online services. Imagine the entire world was working online. Now that everything is returning to normal and markets are open, there is a standard demand for software developers, system engineers, and related fields. Therefore, companies are taking this opportunity to lay off either highly paid or poor-performing employees. And, same people are facing issue getting new jobs because they may ask high or same package and those poor preforming employees are struggling with skill set.

I don't know what else could be the reason, as same companies made phenomenal amount of profit in last 2 to 3 years.

319,"Goodbye Meta, and thanks for everything",11rr6qo,"While some companies such as Microsoft tried to keep SWE salaries low and even ""unionized"" to do so, Zuck decided to do the opposite and pay SWEs competitive salaries. The ridiculously high salaries in tech were thanks to him.

COVID then further inflated the tech bubble, and the ""a day in the life of a Meta PM"" girls and ""break into tech"" influencers did the rest. Now, 3 years later, the economic downturn will bring the tech industry to pre-COVID state or below.

The problem is that tech companies like Meta are overstaffed, overinflated, overvalued, inefficient, and have 10 layers of useless middle management. If you want a proof, think about it this way - why does the stock market react so positively to tech layoffs if layoffs usually are a bearish signal?

Unfortunately, Meta has the worst future outlook of the big tech companies. No one except non-tech-savvy people thinks that Metaverse will be the next thing, as proven by the stock price again. The 11,000 + 10,000 employees laid off are a first correction of the COVID overhiring, the new RTO policies are further silent layoffs, and the 5,000 open roles closed will prevent any growth in the near future.

3- Intelligent systems (has an expert systems class, virtual reality.. Etc)

4- Machine learning (replaces some of the mentioned with deep learning, big data, internet of things..)

5- systems and networks (I've always been interested in systems and low level programming, but I am not a fan of the nature of must jobs involving networks).



I know many people argue that these specialisations are not important when you graduate, and an internship is much more useful but I am trying to work with what I have and I feel like the type of classes that I take even if they won't prepare me for a career, at least they would push me toward a general direction.

Morale has plummeted because the execs cut off all raises and bonuses, but they got 7-fig bonuses themselves.

We're a company of about 1k people, so not that small. 

It was tolerable until I got not even a penny for a raise, and I've never asked for one before until this year, and my boss just wants to add more work to our plates. I don't trust my boss anymore but the company has been good to me over the years. Regardless, one thing after another and a major retention problem has kept me quite unhappy for about 6 months.

341,Career shift - 35yo - no xp,11ri07q,"Hi everyone!

A bit of background: I'm 35yo, I've been working in Video Game QA for the past 14 years, climbed the ladder, promotions, yada-yada... and I want to leave. I just can't anymore, and the road ahead looks somehow promising, but not something I want to do for the rest of my life.

Navigating the internet, I started digging a bit about coding, web dev, software dev, full stack, and started a crash course on YouTube for the basics of HTML/CSS. I really enjoyed it. Did the whole 7 hours in 3 days.

I researched a bit and found out about Odin Project (not for me right now) and a Javascript course from Udemy with Jonas Schmedtmann. I'm really enjoying it so far, and I just finished the module about functions (yay me).
After this, I'm planning on jumping into (possibly) React, and I have no idea what next (CS50?).

The question is... is it a doable path for me, not on my 20s anymore, to be able to shift to this career?

Did anybody here change from a non-related field/no coding xp to land a decent job and climb the ladder?

How did you do it? Straight to what you wanted to do, or started as front end, then software dev... is there a recommended path to follow?

I work from noon to 8PM, so I have the mornings free to focus on this without impacting my daily life (well, I'll play less video game, I guess lol).

342,Full stack Developer to glorified CRM manager. Looking for advice.,11rhdnh," 

TLDR: Went from full stack developer to gloried CRM manager. I'm looking for experiences similar to this and how it effected your career, how you represented it on your resume, etc.

My background:

1. Bachelors of Computer Science 3.5 GPA & a Bachelors of Psychology
2. 1+ year of experience as a full stack developer with a small start up. React/Typescript/Python/Postgresql/GCP/Docker. Company was sad to see me go and the founder and my manager both stated they would definitely give me positive referral.
3. 8+ years of management experience (not in code)
4. Decent amount of side projects using other languages

I recently got a new job as a ""Database Developer"". I applied to be a full stack engineer at the company and got to the interview portion. I heard I wasn't chosen and thought that was that.

I get an email from someone at the company wanting to talk over the phone. They were very long winded explaining their opinions on a lot of tangential things, as well as the direction for their department, mentioning things like spinning up new repos. They ask about my experience with databases but eventually got to the point of offering me a job with them for a different position. Said I didn't get the job I applied for but that I would be a good fit for this role given my experience.

In the offer letter the pay was 150% more than what my previous job was paying me, closer to where I live, and some better benefits in terms of 401k.

I finally start, and I come to find out I'm a glorified CRM manager. I'm managing their app in Quickbase. I don't think I'm going to be writing any code for this job, and can't help but feel like this is going to be black mark on resume.

The work environment also doesn't seem like a place where I would grow much, even if I was writing code for them. They seem very disorganized in terms of roles. No one seems to know what anyone else does and apparently the turnover rate for many of the positions is high.

My previous job stated the door was still open if I didn't like my new job. I've never done that before and I have my reservations about returning to a job I previously left. I've already started applying to new jobs.

Has anyone had this happen to them, or interviewed people who have had this happen to the them and what was your experience? Would any of you recommend going back to my previous job? Find ways to code in this current job? Just hope it looks good on my resume and jump ship asap?",BeardedDrummer,1,1,0.67
343,Received an offer from a ~50 person tech startup in NorCal. What are non-obvious questions I should be asking the recruiter about the offer?,11rghst,"15 YOE and I received an offer for a tech startup that has \~50 employees and recently got a Series A.I'm being hired as a ""Software Manager"" which will be the first time I'll be in this role full time.  I previously had this role in addition to an IC role that was wrapped into the title of ""Team Lead"".

I've never worked for a company this small nor have I worked for a company where I had the chance to acquire stock.  I feel like I'm in a position where I do not l know what I don't know and looking for some advice.   If there is a better place to post then please let me know.

I have the chance to acquire ""options"", which if I understand correctly from googling around is basically the right to purchase stock at some price in the future.  This is different than RSUs which is what a company like Google would offer.  The options have the stipulation of a ""1 year cliff, 5-year vesting"".  Is this pretty standard?

Pretty much the options are worthless in my mind.  It's basically a lottery ticket, but salary is double than what I'm getting now which is why I'm considering this.  Granted I currently live north of Boston, MA and I would have to relocated before the end of the year to NorCal to work in a hybrid office.  This is a robotics company working with an embedded team, so it's not unreasonable.

The company actually gave me 2 offers to consider with varying amount of options and base pay. I'm not sure if I should read in to this as to how much they think their options are worth today.  The 2 offers are the follow with a ""1 year cliff, 5-year vesting"".

    Salary:  $210K
    Options: 19,000
    
    Salary:  $220K
    Options: 9,500

A question I already have is how much would I have to pay for the options since that was not listed.  I think this is called a strike price, if I googled correctly.

Should I care about the number of outstanding options there are out there?  Does the percent that represent the 19K they are offering me matter?

I previously asked about the Silicon Valley Bank issue and while they had their money there they assured me that they have access to it and is in process of moving to a new bank.  I feel like I should be asking more questions around this, but I'm not sure what I what would be good to know.

I already have questions about relocation assistance, signing bonus, health care plans, 401K plans, and so forth.  Is it unreasonable to expect to see the details of the various plans vs the name of the plan?

I'm sure there are tons more question I don't even know I should care about.  Thanks for any suggestions!

=====================================================================

Edit:

People are asking the same questions over and over again that I already got answers to.  So I'm just going to post them here.

This post was mainly looking for questions about the stock and business side as it is a series A startup.  I've vetted the cultural and engineering side to my satisfaction and have asked all the basic and non-basic questions.

&#x200B;

Q: What does the runway look like / what kind of funding does <company> have and looking to acquire in the future

A: We are currently going through our series A funding and have a runway that carries us at least through the end of the year. When we consider runway we always like to have a plan A, B, C, etc. that we can shift to based on how fundraising is looking which is why I say at least through the end of the year. The series A round we are currently going through is to carry us through launching our first production units and covers the next few years.

&#x200B;

Q: How do you see the company growing in the short and long term?

A: We are slowly ramping up our hiring (in conjunction with our funding round) to be able to staff what we need to complete our first production satellites that enable our first phase of service to users. This will roughly double the size of the Engineering team in the next year. Longer term, it depends a bit on what ends up coming into scope in the product roadmap which is still an evolving plan beyond our first phase of service – some options only require very little additional growth, while other options will require more growth.

&#x200B;

Q: Who are <company's> competitors and how are you better positioned than them?

A: <company I never heard of> and a few others but no one has launched anything yet. We have patents for our core technology which also helps give us a better position over/against competitors.

&#x200B;

Q: Where have engineers at <company> worked in the past?

A: I like to say “the whos who of <industry> including both new <industry> (SpaceX) and old <industry> (Maxar/Lockheed)” and “from our customer segment (e.g. Ford and Waymo)”

344,Take somewhat related job to software engineering while I continue to look?,11rgdu0,"I graduated in May with a B.s in CompSci and have made 2 final interviews for a SWE jobs but no offers. I recently got an offer for a consulting job.  There is a marginal amount of coding involved, and in a proprietary coding language similar to Java.  Basic SQL statements are also used.  Other potentially transferable experience would be working in an Agile environment.  A CS degree is not required for the job, and most of the people in the role have an IT degree or an Information Science degree to give an explanation of the actual amount of CompSci expertise they were looking for.

Due to life events/trying to get through school in a shorter amount of time, I took summer classes instead of taking an internship during college (a mistake I know), and I know this is one of the reasons it is so difficult for me to find a job.

It seems like most of the people who were in my position eventually go into data science or another consulting or management job.  I was only able to find a few people who went into software engineering after holding my position on LinkedIn, and they either had a Masters in IT prior to taking this job or a prior SWE internship.

345,How should I negotiate salary and the position in my case?,11rfldw,"Hi,  
I'm a fresh CS graduate. I worked for a couple of weeks in a company without negotiating my position and salary. The company used to have a fixed structure (starting $8000/mo, increment every \~3mo) which I knew beforehand from seniors and assumed it would the same for my case.

After 4 weeks, I was let know that they're gonna pay weekly basis and it's $2000/wk for external projects (projects that they get from other clients) and $1000/wk for internal projects (their in house softwares).

After expressing that I thought their starting is $8000/mo, they decided, to my delight, to give me $8000 for the 4 weeks I worked (I mostly worked on internal projects) and wants to negotiate the salary for future.

It feels like they are going to ask me to work on internal projects which may also be on weekly contracts (that poses possibility of not having work in some weeks) And it's $4000/mo (assuming I get to work the whole month) which is below the median in my area ($5000/mo).

348,Toxic insecure non-programmer at my neck: how to deal with him once and for all?,11rdjx6,"Hey all. I started in a junior role recently as the sole programmer. I was brought in to rewrite a legacy application that's disorderly and where the code was mostly written by a mechanical engineer who did it part-time. His code is unreadable. He had been pushing reams of comments and notes to himself like educational links, with no overall organisation and no comments on the code itself. It's some of the worst written code I've ever seen, magic numbers, everything you can imagine. I've come in and I've been doing really well. Meeting task deadlines set by myself in tandem with our boss, and I have a hold on the entire project and its architecture.

Sadly this mechanical engineer is playing up. I was nothing but polite to him since I started, I even gave a bit of praise where I could to build a rapport, but he has this gigantic ego and is incredibly insecure on top. He thinks his code is the best thing since sliced bread.

Now he is getting involved in my work as if he is my supervisor or boss or something. When I accomplished the task he had not been able to do before I joined, he kept gnawing at me trying to catch me out on my solution. I answered all of his questions with confidence and correctly and I had the working solution to back up why it had worked - like why these technologies and so on.

Then today I kinda needed his help about a domain related thing and he basically told me to look it up. It was literally a domain question that he could have answered off the top of his head, it was looking for a selection of something. I super rarely asked him anything since starting since he is so bad at explaining, but even this request to give me a simple list of things he would not do without patronising me. He is looking for chances to undermine me whenever he can. And I mainly asked him in an attempt to build rapport with him on his home turf and to set the stage for our future interactions. There are a few other examples of him trying to undermine me.

So far how I've dealt with him:

When he got involved in the task he failed to do, by trying to tell me what to do when I had already done that thing, I immediately told him to leave the implementation to me. He didn't get the message and went back and forth on the technical a few times rather than help me with the domain knowledge. Our boss has started to notice it and has tried to nudge this guy to focus on the domain/knowledge side of things.

I will have to work with this guy for this domain specific knowledge though I am limiting that in so far as possible.

What can I do about him? If I'm answering back sharply, nobody else cares. I'm the only programmer and non-member of the core mechanical engineering team. He has also completely unnecessarily and arrogantly mentioned his domain expertise when there was no call for it at all. I am sick of him. HELP!",FormNo,13,0,0.43
349,Is not knowing the company name normal for tech recruiting?,11rcqbe,"So, a company named Ascendion reached out to me.

They'd then have me relocate somewhere and do a 2 month contract.

We made a lot of assumptions in our conversation and I am writing this post to hopefully gain some perspective on things :).

My friend and I are both final year computing students in university and recently we were having a conversation about fresh graduate roles. I specialise in Web Development and have a preference for frontend dev. My friend however, has focused much more on the backend side of things in both his internships and university education.

He mentioned that since we are computing students, it might be wiser if we start our careers as Backend Devs since he feels like the barriers of entry are higher for non-computing students. 

Additionally, it’ll be easier for us to hop from Backend Dev to Fullstack/Frontend Dev as compared to Frontend Dev to Fullstack/Backend Dev because you learn much more (“technical”) things that are harder to pick up later in your career such as writing code for business logic, diving into some infrastructure stuff, learning how to set up load balancing properly.

* A plan to flatten the organization by increasing the number of direct reports, while still keeping it below 10.

* Lower priority projects across the organization will be discontinued.

* Emphasis on RTO.

With less hiring, I’ve made the difficult decision to further reduce the size of our recruiting team. We will let recruiting team members know tomorrow whether they’re impacted. We expect to announce restructurings and layoffs in our tech groups in late April, and then our business groups in late May.

I come with some skills gaps, because I haven't written unit tests, and have no front end JavaScript framework experience (which sucks, and I'm working to fill that gap, but the jobs that want, for example, React experience, want years of it). 

When I get the offer letter, I'm going to ask for a boost up to $90K as the base. I think when we had our 15 minute call I was flabbergasted that the offer was so low. I had been expecting something much closer to $100K. Maybe I'm wrong about what to expect? 

They also said that they will re-evaluate at 90 days to determine if they're underpaying me or not. 

idk what to do. Take the job? Hold out for something with more pay? I've still got a few months left of reserves, and it's taken about 6 weeks for me to get to this first offer from a company.",MysteriousLeader6187,7,0,0.43

Flash forward to today and we still haven't found a lead developer, and the other two developers have left, leaving just me to support our existing customers, develop new code and fix bugs/answer support tickets as they come in, and onboard another Jr developer. There's already customer impact as problems arise in more technically complex areas of the code where I risk doing more damage than good. Even in areas where I'm capable of developing a fix, I have no one for code review, best practices, etc. Basically flying blind.  

I'm new to the industry so I guess what's the move? I know I'm pretty lucky to have landed a junior role, so just suck it up, learn what I can, and continually remind my managers that this isn't sustainable and will impact customer satisfaction?

So my question is why are companies willing to pay so much for a mid tester but are not interested in hiring a junior developer for much less? Isn't development supposed to be better paid? Makes me wonder if the transition is such a good idea. 

I am not US based, I am based in Europe in a country with a ridiculous internal market, so I only apply to foreign companies with operations here, thats where those values come from.

The issue I'm having is that I'm just getting rejected right away from any job I apply to and I'm not sure why. My guess is that my CV technically doesn't match the requirements because technically I can't say I have X years of experience in Golang or Rust or whatever, even though any developer could tell you it really doesn't take much time to adjust to a new language. I'm eager and willing to learn and I try to show that whenever I can, in my CV, in any ""Tell us about yourself"" question etc. I can understand that companies want relevant experience, but I don't understand why I'm not at least given a coding test to assess my skills.

Since we had a lot of talent in our team, at the engineering level, several of my colleagues, including myself, have recently received contacts from other companies to conduct an interview.

I ended up talking to a startup that has an extremely interesting project, and that is currently growing at an overwhelming speed. 

The head of engineering contacted me after former colleagues (from the company that was shut down) he interviewed praised my work, he told me that he would love to have me on his team, and sent me a simple take-home challenge just to check my skills.

Some of my former colleagues will most likely accept the job offer from this startup because they were very satisfied with the approach, and they were assured that the environment was not bureaucratic, and that everyone had ownership over the product

Unlike the startup that I was before, this one has many more seniors, and they dominate the market globally, they basically don't have any competition yet.

What makes me undecided is that, at the moment I only have 3 years of experience and I would like to work in a big company. It's good to work in startups, but it's all very unstable, you never know what might happen in the following day. I was quite happy where I was working and suddenly I became unemployed

Hi my goal is to become a freelance full stack dev and eventually build a saas.

One thing I've noticed is even though I'm confident in my work, both soft skills and technical skills. 

My issue is speed and focus; my development speed is slow; I've written plenty of code over the years, but I feel my speed has never increased. 

I'll plan and start to code, lose my train of thought, reread my code to remember what I was doing, lose it again, double/triple/quadruple reread the same code before I move on to the next part I want to write. This cycle slows down my coding considerably 3-10x sometimes, depending on how often/easily I'm losing it.

Subjectively speaking, tickets that should take me less than a day can take up to three, and tickets that should take me three days can take up to a week.

However, my school also offers a Computer Engineering program, which is basically a CS + EE degree. I’ve looked at the requirements for both options and the classes I would have to take are literally the exact same except for maybe 1 or 2. My concerns are that:

1. Computer Engineering might be looked at by employers as a hardware degree even though at my school 75% of it is software. I want to focus on software, so I’m worried I’ll be looked upon negatively when compared to other CS students.

2. I’ve heard that minors don’t actually mean anything significant, so if I ever decide to go into embedded stuff, an employer would rather hire an EE/CmpE.

419,Feeling burned out and thinking about abandoning my career in software development,11qn0x8,"I'm a novice/intermediate self-taught dev. I was able to get my most recent job through a friend. At this job, I worked a year as a full-stack web developer on a small team but was recently laid off.

Going into it, I knew next to nothing about web development. I had to learn everything on the job for both the front and backend, and all of the supplemental tools that go along with that. I also had to learn about the field we were creating software for itself.

My entire time there was very, very difficult and frustrating. I am burned out.

At this job, I learned that I might have to devote my entire life to software development (eat, sleep, code) if I ever want to be competent in this field. I have a feeling that it was only so difficult because I didn't know anything about web development going in, and I was a novice programmer to begin with.

But maybe that's not the truth.

Maybe the truth is that I will always find this work difficult because I have no passion for it.

I see/hear about other developers that are, well, passionate about this field. They seem to eat, sleep, and code. That is most certainly not me. I have some interest in CS, but I don't and have never coded for fun in my spare time. I have other interests, hobbies, and aspirations that I spend my free time on. I feel going forward I will primarily be programming to make a well-paid, stable living, and not much more than that.

Now I am unemployed. I watch videos like [The Harsh Reality of Being a Software Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws6zCMdp9Es) and I become very afraid. I am weighing my options, and wondering if I belong in this field.

I don't aspire to work at a FAANG. I just want a chill job that will pay decently (not extravagantly), and that has a good work-life balance. Is this even a real thing in software development though?

420,"Number of CS field graduates breaks 100k in 2021, almost 1.5x the number from 4 years prior",11qmy69,"These numbers are for the US. Each year the Department of Education publishes the number of degrees conferred in various fields, including the field of ""computer and information sciences"". This category contains more majors than pure CS (the full list is [here](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&cipid=88073)), but it's probable that most students are pursuing a computer science related career.

The numbers for the 2020-2021 school year recently came out and here's some stats: 

* The number of [bachelor's](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_322.10.asp) degrees awarded in this field was 104,874 in 2021, an increase of 8% from 2020, 47% from 2017, and 143% from 2011.

* 22% of bachelor's degrees in the field went to women, which is the highest percentage since just after the dot com burst (the peak percentage was 37.1% in 1984). 

* The number of [master's](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_323.10.asp) degrees awarded was 54,174, up 5% from '20 and 16% from '17. The number of [PhDs](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_324.10.asp) awarded was 2,572, up 6.5% from '20 and 30% from '17. 25% of PhDs went to women.

* The number of bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering decreased slightly (-1.8% from 2020), possibly because students are veering to computer science or because the pandemic interrupted their degrees.

Here's a couple graphs:

* [Stacked bar graph of BS and MS degrees 2001-2021](https://imgur.com/dcDxD0K)

* [Line graph of BS degrees from 1995-2021](https://imgur.com/h8m5Mol)

These numbers don't mean much overall but I thought the growth rate was interesting enough to share. From 2015-2021, the y/y growth rate has averaged 9.6% per year (range of 7.8%-11.5%). This doesn't include minors or graduates in majors like math who intend to pursue software.

Entry level appears increasingly difficult and new grads probably can't even trust the job advice they received as freshmen.  Of course, other fields are even harder to break into and people still do it every year.

Mid level and above are probably protected the bottleneck that is the lack of entry level jobs. Master's degrees will probably be increasingly common for US college graduates as a substitute for entry level experience.",acctexe,471,890,0.96

For math, degree won't really make a difference in interviews but the knowledge can be very useful since I'm planning to master in AI and machine learning after completing Bachelor's. But what concerns me is math will consume too much time of mine and I won't be able to participate in possible project. I'm also really into algorithms and wondering if math will contribute to my understandings. But if I won't be able to participate in projects then why learn all that stuff?

For physics, the main reason is I always loved physics and really keen on learning advanced physics. But the problem is same that It will consume too much time, plus won't really make a difference to my cs career. Only benefit is my personal satisfaction which is not enough.

For psychology, I'm only considering this so I'll have enough spare time to develop my cs skills and work on as much as projects with my colleagues.

423,How do I transition to a more developer focused job?,11qlv30,"I joined my current job after I graduated about 2 years ago and at first it seemed like I could get some good developing experience right from the get go. I started to learn how to develop in Java with some parts in Springboot and also learned Selenium for testing. I then transitioned over to working on Tasktop and ever since then I haven't so much as even opened an IDE in months.

I only joined my current job because I wanted experience right out of college and wasn't intending to stay here for a while. I have stayed (so far) because it allowed me to learn other non-technical skills outside of work while I (thought I would) learn software development skills at work.

On paper I ""should"" know how develop in Java working with Selenium, (basic) Springboot, Maven and the like; and while that's kind of true I've never worked on a coding project before. I've only worked on personal projects to help out one/two people or programs that automate manual work I'm doing elsewhere. I have little knowledge on how version control works, never done code reviews, or worked with other developers on a code project before. Management is also pushing me and other developers towards more devops roles over time, since my company isn't mainly software focused.

The only area I know a decent amount about is, is game development since it's the entire reason I got into software in the first place. I took a hard turn away from those jobs after hearing non-stop bad news from that area and ended up where I am now. It's not all bad, it's not stressful and allows me to learn other things, it's just that my location and job type are not what I want to settle in to.

When I look at other jobs I see technologies & languages I don't know or have worked with. I know you don't need a deep knowledge of any of those areas as long as you can transition knowledge between languages/technologies, but I'm worried about my lack of actual development experience. I've done a few code challenges personally to see if I still have some skills and I still remember how to program luckily, so it's not all too bad. I'm just unsure how to go about job searching down the road.

457,Which subjects are important in a CS degree?,11qa4fl,"
A bit of a back story, I'm doing a Bachelor of Business (Finance major).   
My previous years and former self were a fog that I want to get out of, I didn't really put much thinking in it when I choose to study business, I also hate it, really hate it. That combined with untreated ADHD made me a very bad student...  


Everything's getting better this year though fortunately, I got diagnosed and started meds, read Atomic Habits 3 times. I'm finally doing better at uni. But unluckily for me the only subject that could made me sit and enjoy and actually eager to learn is Programming.   
It's a basic Programming 1 subject which teaches fundamentals Java and Python (from variables to classes, objects, inheritance). Man I love it... But Finance still gives me yawning episodes but it's a bit better than before. 

I've also started TOP foundation (front-end stuff) and absolutely love it. YES. Finally something I like to do and find really interesting.

So long story short, I changed my study planner from doing Acct + Finance to Finance + Electives.  
I get to study 7 Electives! My Finance major is only 8 subjects, so I basically have the chance to study a major-minor in CS! Although without the official name... :( 

So I'm trying to pick the diamonds, the absolute chads in a CS degree to study, here's my list after researching online:  


Programming 1  
Programming 2  
Database Fundamentals  
Data Structure and Algorithms  
Advanced Algorithms  
Discrete Maths  
Last one - undecided.

I can choose to study basically anything (from OS to CS theory to Web Dev to Data Systems...)

People seem to prefer OS to CS theory here? So I kinda don't know what to do... This is where I need your help, please help... 

I'm also aware of [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) and it is definitely on my list for the future, the guide said itself that if you're not a competent programmer as of this moment, go become one then come back to the guide in a year or two... So I'm planning to do that!

458,I am in a difficult situation and I don't know what to do,11q8xd0,"Two years ago, I started freelancing as a fullstack engineer after burning out from working for a startup for two years which, in hindsight, took advantage of me. After realizing the value of the work I'm doing I left and started freelancing, which went really well (I made about 10-15k a month, which is a lot for an EU freelancer). For one of my clients, a young startup, I was developing a complex B2B platform. Business went really well for that startup, and it became my main client, making up most of my monthly income (which of course you should avoid as a freelancer).  8 months in, the approached me with an offer: They wanted me as the CTO of their company (that's now 7 months ago). I really didn't want to work for a failing startup again and avoid repeating the same mistakes, so I clearly stated my demands, which aimed at minimizing the risk of the company failing and me still making a decent salary along the way. The demand was €10,000 salary a month + 10 percent of the company, take it or leave it. As I was already making a lot as a freelancer, and my actual plan back then was to scale my freelance business and hire additional staff, I thought that's a fair deal. I have 7 YoE and am really passionate about my work, don't mind doing over hours, have experience managing teams, and don't mind hopping on a call with a customer at 10PM to fix a problem. I did know that I probably would have to put in a lot more work than previously, work on weekends, and have practically no holidays, but that's all acceptable looking at the possibility of a potential and not so unrealistic exit.

They accepted my offer, we were all happy, celebrated, and started working. From that moment on, I was actually publicly presented as a co-founder everywhere, which is strongly needed when searching for investors (a software startup without a co-founding CTO is not well received as you can imagine).

It was indeed one of the most stressful and challenging times in my life, I am the sole developer building a whole platform used by 120+ enterprise clients, and the number is growing. I didn't take a single day off since then and fully free weekends are rare.

The business is going well, and our CEO is working nearly full time on raising money (until now we bootstrapped).

Today, our CEO calls me, and says our cashflow doesn't look that well, but it's manageable. Thing is, he said to me, it is very difficult for him to justify my high payroll to investors, as I am earning as much as all the other 3 co-founders combined (who hold the rest of the company shares). He argued that investors don't like to see the unequal pay distribution and that it could become a problem, if not \*the deciding factor\*, for receiving investment.

I said to him, I honestly don't know what to respond now, our initial conditions were quite clear and reducing my salary because of investor relations... I don't know, just seems wrong, as I really put so so much effort in this, and after all it's a software company... and I am the only person developing and maintaining the software, and I didn't join as a ""traditional"" co-founder right from the start.

Now I wanted to ask you folks: Am I the asshole here? Do I demand too much? Should I steer in and offer to reduce my salary?

**Note**: From the 10k I make monthly, I directly pay 2k to one of the co-founders, because I bought the 10% from him and I essentially ""pay them off"" this way. So, after taxes, all in all, it's about 4-5k.

This situation really puts a lot of pressure on me currently as I really like the company, the people, the co-founders and the overall product vision. But this makes me really anxious now, and I don't know what to do, as I don't want to be the person who ruins it for everyone.

I'm probably too emotional on this to see things objectively, it feels like I can't see the forest for the trees anymore.

&#x200B;

1. **What's the day-to-day like?** What's the work-life balance? How difficult is the job itself (I know there are different jobs, but generally either backend or frontend, at least your experiences)? Honestly I'm kinda worried it's too much for me.
2. **How stressful is it / can it be?** This is huge for me. I'm very worried that this field would be too fast-paced and too much would be expected of me and I'd have to constantly keep up. Right now in life I just want something that pays ok, will get my life actually moving (NEET and stuck for a while now) and won't make me wanna Roblox myself.
3. **What's actually most important to getting hired**, at least as a junior? How hard is it to actually get a job?
4. **How much math is there?** I'm not horrible, but I'd rather not.
5. **Is Python necessary?**
6. **Is part-time work viable** or will I be dismissed offhand if I want that? Financially I'm fine RN.
7. **What's the general vibe, in your experience?** This sorta ties back to 2. I'm just scared of getting myself stuck in a big impersonal corporate constantly online machine, tech screams that to me.

I have been an IT kinda guy since I discovered Linux in the mid 2000s. I never pursued anything tech related though and did my undergraduate in a non CS field. Then in the mid 2010's I really got interested in coding and started learning PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. I build a few applications and by 2018 I was confident enough in my abilities and what I had under my belt to apply for a masters program in the UK, which accepted me thanks to showing my strong self taught CS background and a letter of recommendation from someone that worked with me and the institution I studied at. I completed the course in 2021, and have been trying to break into development on my own, remotely, for over a year. 

My situation is a bit unique. I am an American living abroad (have lived abroad for over a decade) and would like to do development work for EU/NA clients. I've registered and signed up for upwork and have been making bids on projects for over a year with no responses. I've also been continuing to develop my skillset, and have been learning Rust (more because at this point I want to learn something that I want to learn, a whole degree in everything from mobile development, project management, fullstack development, etc, while exciting and educational, hasn't always been what I would choose to learn), and have started working on some applications of my own in Rust, and I'm contemplating beginning to contribute to a couple projects on github. 

**My Goal:**

Short term, I just want to find a part time/freelance work in NA or EU working with technology I know and am confident using, such as PHP+MySQL (regardless of framework. I've tried Laravel and feel pretty comfortable I could get up to speed with it quick. for example). But I am not currently working in development or technology. I'm working in Education and am making a comfortable living with this and would like to do free lance/part time until I have a stronger CV/Resume and portfolio to actually transition to development as a fulltime job. Quitting my job for the next year+ is NOT an option for me now and I really want to gain real world experience

**Problem:**

How do I break into development? I have knowledge, background, and have built some applications for a former employer (server side tools), but I would probably still come in as an entry level programmer based on my lack of developer experience.

My thought process is something as follows:

“Tell me about yourself”

“I graduated from college with a degree in electrical engineering after which I started my career as an electrical design engineer, mainly focusing on the design and construction of electrical power systems. Although I enjoyed the work, I quickly realized there were a number of day-to-day tasks that could be automated with programming. So I began building custom Python scripts to help automate a few of my tasks, and eventually began building a full suite of internal company software tools that helped increase productivity of the design engineering department I was working in. Eventually my role transitioned from electrical engineer to software engineer in our internal software development department, where I mainly focused on building full stack web applications automate tasks to help with engineering productivity. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time with my current team but feel my career may be better served by working for a product-focused technology company, which is the reason I’ve applied to this role and hope to work with your company in the near future.”

I'm a university student majoring in computer science at a smallish university, in my fourth year of study. I've got one more year of study to go, doing a 4 year degree in five years to give myself a little more room to breathe. I've got a healthy academic transcript so far, like a 4.2 GPA right now, though I note that I'm Canadian and I'm not sure if the system changes at all, but I've got an A- or better in all of my courses, with an A+ in more than half of them.

However, I've been absolutely sucker punched by a course, analysis of algorithms (distinct from analysis and design of algorithms, which i did very well in), taught by a prof that is absolutely taking me apart. I'm definitely not going to take another class with this prof going forwards, but in the interim I'm faced with a tricky choice. I figure I could probably get like a B- in the course if I try to finish it out, which saves me from needing to take another math course for my math minor but leaves me with a bad mark, or I could withdraw from the course to avoid a bad mark on my transcript but doing so would require me to take another class.

I'm a SWE at one of the major companies in the networking industry (working on Layer 3 stuff mostly). I jumped in shortly after graduating and have been working here for \~9 months now.

I wanted to get some insight from those who started in a similar role and for those who still work in the networking space:

* Where are you now? (Industry, role, company)
* Did you stay in the networking space or pivot to a different industry, and why?
* What advice would you give someone just starting out in the space on what career path to take for best employment prospects and earnings?
* Did you regret starting your career in/staying in networking?
* What is the compensation and attainability of upper-level roles in this industry like compared to others?

I personally enjoy various aspects of my job and learning about the intricacies of networking. However, my worry is that the knowledge I'm learning is fairly niche and there aren't that many companies hiring folks in this industry compared to something like a Backend Developer which virtually every company needs.

494,Should I Obtain PM or IT Certifications Given My Background?,11pmc3z,"As a quick outline, I’m looking to transition careers and/or continue obtaining certifications and am looking for advice to the best approach. Input as to where to focus next is highly valued and I want to thank you all in advance for your input on this inquiry.  


Objective: 

To transition from Real Estate Sales into Project Management. I have roughly five years’ of on paper PM experience (over the last ten years) in the small business environment.   


Recent endeavors: 

I obtained PMP® and PMI-ACP® certifications in early March, and I have seen a slight increase in outreach already. I have reached out to multiple recruiting services over the last two weeks and have received basically no follow-ups. Additionally, I’ve applied for roughly 150 jobs over the last two months which I’ve had roughly five over the phone interviews.  


Future possible endeavors: 

Now the question is, do I start applying for positions only, focus on online networking, continue a balance approach of applying for jobs while also obtaining more certifications, or something else?  


My current path: 

Given my situation I’ve narrowed it down to two primary paths which include moderate levels of both job applications and continuing certifications. 

1. PM Path - This seems the simplest from here given that I have one of the highest and most accredited certifications (PMP) you can have in this domain. Continuing certifications, in order of operation, if I wanted to continue down a mastery path would be:

a. Certified Scrum Master (CSM)

b. PMI-RMP® - PMI Risk Management Professional 

c. IASSC Certified Lean Six Sigma Black Belt™ (ICBB™)

The only drawback I see to this approach would be that I may be viewed as overly specific. 

2. Analytics/Software Path - I’ve had a few interviews for PM roles that I’ve been looked over because they want someone who understands specific systems, most commonly SAS, SAP, Salesforce, BlueYonder, MS Project, Xactimate, or insert one of a hundred other applications here. 

While worthwhile, I feel it would be difficult to obtain certifications for specific software packages until I acquire a job with an existing set of systems. Therefore, I thought a good offset for a lack of individual software experience would be to acquire Analytics and IT based certifications. Certifications, in order of operation, if I wanted to continue down this more general path would be:

a. ITIL 4 Foundation > ITIL 4 Managing Professional

b. Google Data Analytics Certificate for introductory phase (not really a certification)

c. Associate Big Data Analyst (ABDA™)  


Conclusion/Advice:

Does being more rounded with generally certifications seem to be a better use of time than mastering the PM approach? Do these seem like good potential certifications to take if the former? Are there certifications out there you would recommend instead? Should I focus on individual software systems instead? Should I focus more on blanketing my resume and work on acquiring a position now? 

Finally, it may also be worthwhile to potentially go back to a brick-and-mortar university for a B.S. Civil Engineering Degree, but I’ve been reluctant to do so given the cost and that I have a M.S. Business Management Degree. I feel I get overlooked a lot because my degrees, while from accredited universities, are not exactly household names. Thoughts on this?

• M.S. Business Management

• B.S. Business Management

496,No Return Offer Post Summer 2022 Internship,11pm9f1,"Hi all! I'm still processing this news as it's still pretty fresh. I interned with a company for essentially 3 summers (started in Fall 2021; ended in Summer 2022). I never received an ounce of negative feedback my entire time there. I was really hoping I'd get an offer after graduation (because how could I not???). 

Last September I receive a survey from the company saying that they were interested in my next steps and I filled it out immediately. It wasn't an automated email but rather sent from a real person who works there (we connect on LinkedIn - he's very nice). I'm thinking, ""ok great! They didn't forget about me! I have a fat chance of walking away with a return offer"". Now, my roommate told me to always have a back-up plan and that I should still look for jobs. I thought to myself, ""nahhhh nothing is going to go wrong. I'll get my offer :)"". I was wrong.

February 2023 rolls around. I email the woman in charge of talent acquisition and inform her I'll be graduating very soon (this May) and am interested in potential full time opportunities. A few days later, I get this heartbreaking email:

""Thank you for reaching out! I hope all has been well.
 
At this time, I’m unfortunately not working on any positions that would be a fit for you. However, please feel free to check out our career’s page and apply to openings that look of interest.
 
Best of luck with your last semester!""

Now, when I first read the email, I was in SHAMBLES, rightfully so, as I was really banking on this job. I was thinking, ""oh dear god WHAT DID I DO WRONG?"", feeling like an absolute failure ( I still do). After re-reading it a few more times, I realized it has nothing to do with my performance explicitly, but rather there are no roles for me straight up! I'm thinking that since I wrapped up my internship last Summer, there hasn't been any entry level SWE roles under this company AT ALL (which makes sense given the market we are in currently). It's crazy because I have not seen any entry level SWE openings on the career's page since I looked last Fall. Now, when I checked the career's page just now, I ONLY see senior SWE roles. Upon doing the whole job search, I'm finding mostly senior level roles which is disheartening. 

It took me a while to realize that the email doesn't say ""you can't EVER work here again!! Don't come back!!"". She said she doesn't have anything for me RIGHT NOW. Which doesn't mean forever. Who knows?? A role could open up in a couple months or even 6 months to a year.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for my internship experience, I think I'll have a leg up on some candidates. However, it would have been a dream to finally make that, ""I'm pleased to announce I'll be an incoming SWE at 'X company' after interning with them"" post on LinkedIn. Because that's what LinkedIn is, you basically jerk yourself off right?

I know it's not the end of the world, but it sure feels like it. It really sucks how this ""recession"" is eating up the tech space. I'm also going to stop looking at my feed on LinkedIn for a while. I love seeing folks land their internship/full-time roles and I'm excited for them! Just a little sad for me, you know? When I was applying for my very first internship role, I made a big a** spreadsheet with like 50 rows on it. Now, I don't even have the motivation/energy to do that. Resisting the feminine urge to crawl into bed and not come out. 

How does someone intern with a Fortune 50 3 times but doesn't land the job?

Anyone else in the same boat as me? Anyone not get a return offer because of this f*cked up market we're in?? Please comment down below.",nybaldwin714,14,16,0.65

I am in my early-twenties(22) and currently struggling to find my purpose in life. I often find myself torn between different career paths, unsure of which one to pursue. I am hoping to seek guidance and advice from those who have experienced similar struggles or have insights to share.

On one hand, I am considering learning web development, specifically focusing on html/css/js and if you look on my post history i am doing it currently alongside with job. I am aware that this field is oversaturated at the entry level, but the potential for a high income without a degree is appealing. However, I am also intimidated by the numerous frameworks and libraries which i will have to learn, which can be overwhelming for a beginner. projects made by me are total garbage. Also to be honest i have not any interest in this field and currently learning it only for money.

On another hand, I am also drawn to the growing field of data science. I find math to be intriguing, and this field seems to be expanding rapidly. Pursuing a degree in this field seems like a viable option, but I am afraid about potentially failing at this path and wasting my 20s.

Furthermore, in regards of my current situation I have graduated law, but the legal industry in my country pays poorly so i am concerned about missing opportunities in lucrative field of tech and i constantly tell myself that if you work harder for 2/3 years maybe you will land well paying job. but since middle school i was not friend with numbers and performed terribly in STEM subjects so at least it seems safer path but less rewarding.

At the same time, I desire financial stability and the ability to provide for my family. my dream is too safe up money up to one million. I feel like i am in my turning point right now, feel anxious everyday , concerned that I may make a devastating mistake in choosing the wrong path.

503,Data Analyst to Data Engineer or continue learning software for new role?,11piq3d,"Hi lovely people. 

I’m a 28 year old senior data analyst who has been in the data analyst career for about 5 years now.

Recently I’ve started a new job at a big company and it’s been about six months. And I think my experience has helped me learn that this field really isn’t for me anymore.

Some things I really enjoy doing is focusing on growth development, coding, problem solving and having the satisfaction of creating/improving something to help meet business requirements effectively.

In my current field and job I found the process of discussing and presenting data and would much rather focus on code and analysis. Of course this is a necessity in every field, and I think I’m good at it. But I would like to do a lot less. I also wish to be in a field that will encourage more working at home and hybrid working opportunities. Frankly I face quite a bit of dread and anxiety because of how much this is expected from me in this field. So much so I can’t seem to sleep properly due to the stress of thinking about work.

Additionally, I found coding only in SQL (which is the primary job 80% of the time) quite limiting and not much avenues for growth.

As such I’ve thought of two paths and wanted to get your opinions
1) I’ve started a course for a front end developer pathway and working through it everyday so I can switch to a new career in the software field asap.
2) I can transition into a data engineer field as I heard that this role would be aligning with what I have learnt so far, but focus more on coding rather than the client facing aspects of data analytics. Even though it’s more sql work I would be interested to hear how it’s different to an analysts work with sql and the tools/processes for a engineer and how much room there is to grow in them.

Hope there’s anyone else that may have followed the same path. But regardless would love to hear your thoughts.

I'm just unsure how much I should add to this programme, or if I should develop more complex sql querying, before writing it up and putting it on github. The whole project took barely 2 days so it really doesn't feel like I've worked hard enough on it to add it to a portfolio. How do I know when to add a project, or how complex a project should be before adding it to a portfolio?",sp00kyversity,1,2,0.75
512,Questions on Freelancing,11pdzcj,"Background:
* Completed Software Engineering Immersion Boot-camp about 3 years ago
* Proficient in JavaScript, Python and can finesse Ruby
* Proficient in front-end frameworks such as React.js and back-end frameworks/tools (django, rubyonrails, mongodb)
* Currently working as a Customer Success Engineer for about a year and some change (querying databases, working with APIs)

I'd like to get back to more coding/programming work and improve my skills and eventually land a role as a Solutions Engineer at my company. Additionally, and more importantly, I just need the extra cash so I figured I could start some freelance work on the side. I understand this may be filled with n00b questions, but I'd like to learn the intricacies of freelance work.

1. Which websites/sources can I find freelance work to begin with?
2. How would you recommend building a site for a potential client (i.e. Wordpress/SquareSpace vs building your own project from scratch)
3. What are the pros and cons of the methods listed above?
4. Is either method preferred over the other depending on the ask of the customer?
5. Let's say I did decide to build my own project for a customer. What happens once the project is done? Do I ask them to acquire their own domain? Have them set up their own Heroku or AWS account to host the database I've set up for them? Should I give them access to their project's repo on my github or have them create their own github? I guess I'd like to know how to hand off the project to the customer. (Somebody please let me know lol T-T)
6. If I used Squarespace/Wordpress (FYI: haven't learned them yet), do I have them create their own accounts and then basically just work on their sites there?
7. Are there any tips/pitfalls anyone can share in regards to freelance work?

Again, my apologies if these questions are really entry level. If anyone has any guides or sources I can reference for this kind of thing, it'd be much appreciated!

517,Mathematics Graduate Who Needs Advice,11p9rsb,"Hi guys,

I am a soon-to-be college graduate from the midwestern US. I am graduating this May from a top 50 university with a BS in Financial Mathematics and a minor in Computer & Information Science.

Initially, I wanted to gain the skills to become an actuary through my degree, but I've decided instead to aim towards becoming a software engineer, preferably in a role where advanced math is applicable (back-end, AI/ML, game design, data science).

Unfortunately, I did not do well academically throughout my schooling due to a multitude of things, so I'll be graduating with about a 2.3 cumulative GPA.

In addition, I do not have any completed programming projects to showcase to future employers. I do not have a portfolio page for them either. However, I do have a GitHub, and I know roughly how to use it.

Lastly, I do not have any internship or full-time professional experience related to either financial mathematics or computer science at this time.

My coursework related to mathematics included: 
* multivariate calculus, 
* linear algebra, 
* differential equations, 
* probability,
* scientific computing, 
* financial economics, and 
* derivative pricing.

My coursework related to computer science included:
* introduction to programming in Java,
* data structures in Java,
* discrete mathematics,
* data structures & algorithms,
* computer systems, and
* information security.

Given my situation, I am wondering where I should focus my energy in the coming months. My concerns are:
* if you were someone with little academic success (but a STEM degree), no programming projects, no professional experience, but some OOP knowledge with Java, would you apply to jobs or build your portfolio?
* is completing an internship necessary before finding a full-time software development position?
* should I branch out to learn new technologies, such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and build additional projects with those? How far down the Node/React/SQL pipeline should I go?

My thought was to begin The Odin Project to learn to build web applications through the ""Full Stack JavaScript"" track, build and showcase my own projects afterwards, then practice for interviews on LeetCode while applying to jobs, but I'd still be months away after graduation from being hired.

I still need to pay rent. Should I apply for more ""finance-related"" jobs (given my major) and work towards an actual development role with projects, etc. in the meantime?

They're about to send a whole home office setup to my house. The offer letter also requires images of my driver's license, so if this is a scam then that would be the endgame for them.

I responded today asking for a video meeting with someone from the dev team or the dev manager, and mentioned my reservations about accepting an offer without having spoken to a person.

I guess my questions are, how common is this? Am I doing the right thing asking for a meeting? Will they rescind the offer because I'm giving them a hard time?

I'm writing this post so some people can hopefully guide me in the right direction so I can ensure I do good on my first ever technical interview.

Based on the job description maybe one can gauge what interview questions should look like.

To add some more context, I asked my recruiter what to expect and she said 'I still have not heard of what they will be testing you on but I know it will be pretty basic. Just to see what you do know about Python and your problem solving skills and how receptive you are to advice and feedback.' I also asked the manager what to expect and he said, 'We are still deciding what coding challenges we plan to use, so I don't have a firm answer yet. But I expect that there will be 2-3 challenges, with the first one easy (a ""warmup"") and subsequent ones will be more difficult. Nothing too crazy though, the questions should be appropriate for a CSC student with 1-3 years of classes.' I also asked him a couple days before this over zoom and he said data structures , min/max/avg, stuff like that.

Does anyone here have any sort of insight? What should I practice? Which problems? I have been learning the window sliding technique and two pointers/fast slow pointers stuff right now.

I'm going to try and make this post not sound like the other broken record posts that I see here, I feel my view point is different than those. I'm currently attending WGU for a bachelor's degree in software engineering. I'm 29 and needed a career change and have always been interested in computers and dabbled with a lot of hardware and recently some software. The reddit doomers have been saying that SWE is dead and the job market is fucked and will remain to be fucked. I don't think that is true because although I may not know a lot about SWE I do know job market statistics and understand the impact tech has on the future. I believe it will bounce back and the jobs will be there. 

What I have thought about though is maybe I am locking myself in a box as far as my degree goes. My thought is to change my major to a different degree that encompasses more than just SWE, something like:

B.S. Information technology
B.S. Networking & Security
B.S. Cloud computing
B.S. Cyber Security

Yes, my program is great but I feel like every one of those other programs has more certs, a wider overview of tech as a whole, and the same timeline of completion. For example do I learn only about SWE or do I broaden my area of studies so I can have diverse career options in things besides SWE. I am early enough in the program that everything I have completed so far will transfer to a different degree. Maybe I end up liking network security better? All of those programs have scripting and programming courses but the SWE program is more robust. I feel like this may be a much safer option for me.

I'm considering transferring from the University of Connecticut (currently working on a BS Computer Science) to one of the CUNYs (CCNY has a quality program from my understanding), for a variety of reasons.

Also, there is a significant chance that I have epilepsy, so being able to drive in the future is shaky at best. Lastly, UConn is quite expensive, and I'm not sure how I can reasonably pay for the next three years of my education.

As a result, I got hooked into the FIRE movement pretty early on.

However, layoffs + recent work stress have made me realize that I'm no longer interested in gunning for the big bucks. 

I used to think about pivoting to the trading industry / switching to management / leveling up the IC ladder fast, but I don't care about those things anymore.

Instead, my new aim is to hit senior and find places where I can do my 9-5, leave work at work, and spend the rest of my time on my hobbies (volleyball and screenwriting). 

Financially, I just want the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $200k / yr all-in. This would be more than enough to live my life, have fun, and still make steady progress toward my FIRE goals.

However, I'm all too aware that situations at work can change at the drop of a hat. 

So my question is this - what's the minimum level of interview-ready I can be to always be able to quickly find a $200k Sr. SWE job in (relatively) normal job market? 

Including that last piece because I know there's probably nothing I can do in this kind of employer's market as a job-seeker that would give me that sort of leverage.

My thoughts:

1. Coding: be able to solve any Grind75 question in my sleep (~170 questions total)
2. System design: know the system design primer + designing data-intensive applications like the back of my hand. 
3. Technologies / domain-specific??? I've only worked in big tech companies, so this has never been a part of my interview loop. However, from what I've heard, startups and local shops care a lot about familiarity with specific tech stacks.

546,USA CS salaries are insane!,11otekw,"I always hear people on this sub talk about $70k + starting salaries, as a Brit this seems insane.

There is outliers, I see the odd graduate job advertised for $40k - $55k (equivalent in £) but they are few and far between. 

Not sure what the rest of Europe is like but I had no idea how well you guys get paid! 

What is the average starting salary you guys see in whatever country you are from ?

Edit: for those questioning the legitimacy of my claim, [save the student](https://www.savethestudent.org/student-jobs/whats-the-expected-salary-for-your-degree.html#IT) estimates the average starting salary to be £25 k. Other websites estimate it to be about £27k - £33k. One claims it’s £45k average but this has 100% been pulled out of their arse and it’s not a British website

549,Toxic or not,11osy0v,"Toxic or not/ should I quit or not:  
Two of us (me and 'A') plus a mentor ('M') was assigned to create an endpoint for a new web service. 'A' was assigned their own ticket and I was assigned mine. 'A' overdid everything and even completed the part I had to complete.  Note, I'm a new hire so the point was for me to learn. 'A' had apparently assumed that my task/ticket was about something else, even though any person listening to our group conversations would realize they were doing my work (plus it was clearly not a part of their ticket at least). I was adding more features than what 'A' did, but it seems the service won't have use for those extra stuff. So now my 3-4 days of work basically went to waste. I was already very upset on Thursday to see that happen but I thought M would stand up for me and say something like ""let's add the changes from your ticket in a new PR once we finish reviewing this current PR"". But instead he also pretty much stole any chance for me to add anything (the extra stuff) by pushing a new commit today and saying that there's request for pushing this service out quicker. Note, I find 'M' sometimes working on weekends and I'm just like, ""am I supposed to work, too? If yes, why don't people just mention that beforehand instead of sending random texts during the weekend?""

It has happened in the past as well that whatever I worked on - guessing, trying my best to understand their codebase as a new hire thrown into poor documentation - got overlooked and ultimately someone came up with the same idea as I had voiced but somehow they believe they are teaching me something new. 

I'm so tired of this. I take care to ensure my language is always clear and in fact took initiative myself to schedule a feedback session with my manager (it seemed to catch him off guard but he then said he was happy to talk) to understand what they expect from me. I ask for deadlines but no one gives me any. Generally everyone is too comfortable in their jobs (we're talking people past their 40s). Everyone has been here in this suburb 10+ years and I'm just a new grad, moving from a big college to this suburb and just living here for the job.

I am currently working as an ML SWE at a small startup and am looking to find a new job at a bigger company. I was recently contacted by someone from an interview prep course, that promises to help you ace coding assignments, review and polish your resume / LinkedIn, put you in touch with ""their people"", guide you through the interview process and then help negotiate salary. Sounds great right?

I attended their live session and came away thinking that, while the tuition is high, if they can deliver on their promise to its entirety, or at the very least actually give you the contacts and resources they advertise then it might be worth it. However, I can also see many ways how it could be a money grab operation. For one thing, the lack of concreteness during the live session, makes me skeptical about their offering.

551,Advice choosing school path,11osbr5,"Hello, I will do my best to keep this concise and brief. 

I am 27/m with a wife and three children and live in the Midwest. I am a full time Journeyman Industrial Mechanic for one of the big three American Automakers. I have a significant amount of down/free time at work which has allowed me to pursue higher education. I currently am attending University of Maryland Global Campus. This fall I will be going into my 2nd year of undergrad. Now I will get to my question(s).. 

My initial plan was to transfer to Oregon State University this fall as a full time online student for their BS in CS, and to finish my degree in 3 years. I planned to transfer there because from what I've read, they seem to have a more rigorous and respected program compared to UMGC. Recently I discovered that UMGC is accepting training from my time in the military as 30 elective credit hours. In doing so, my degree would only take 2 years to complete, compared to 3 years at OSU. 

To get to my point: 

I am a full time working adult, with a family in children, and I work in a unrelated career field. So internships/co-ops are off the table. My goal with obtaining my degree is to learn as much as possible and become as prepared   As possible to change careers. My degree is not to check a box. 

Should I stick to my original plan of 3 years of education at OSU in their CS program, or should I finish an accelerated path at UMGC and try to get into the field a year sooner? Both degrees would be a BS in CS. I would still take all major and gen ed requirements. I would take little to no electives at UMGC, and would take 30 credit hours of electives at OSU. 

Neither school cost me anything because of my GI Bill and employer tuition assistance. 

Being in the Midwest, does either school hold more weight over the other? 

Since I have no work experience in this field, would OSU program prepare me more than UMGC? Or would UMGC prepare me enough and I should start working sooner?

Overall, the company has a lot going for it. The pay is decent and the benefits are good. For the most part, my coworkers are pleasant to be around. 

Outside of work, I've spent the last year learning software development, roughly 10 to 20 hours per week (depending on the week). I'm working with the C#, SQL, git/bash with my side projects. My long-term goal is to take those projects and use them to transition into a software development job. I promised myself at the one year mark, I would reevaluate what I've learned and where I'm heading, which is what inspired me to make this post seeking advice.

The problem with my current role is that I have no direct exposure to the sort of technologies that will help my long-term career goals. As mentioned above, my only exposure to these technologies is in my free time. Although I have learned a lot in the past year, I don't think I've learned enough. I've come to the conclusion that the only way I can accelerate my learning is to solve more complex software problems in a professional setting. 

So I'm seeking advice on the sort of job roles I could apply to that would put me one step closer to a software development position.

I like this security and the internship will look great on my CV but I will be taking out another year. 

My friends have told me that I will be missing another year, and that I can be earning actual graduate salaries at the end of university a year earlier if I just go univeristy and give up the internship. I have also been told that if I can get this internship, I can probably get another one. However, I personally like the security and don't care about delaying the university experience another year if it will benefit me in the long term.

Situation: currently doing a second work term at a relatively good company. They offered me an extension to stay for a 8 month work term (4 month on top of current). I was pleased at first but then I realized it might be a non-blessing in disguise.    


Problem: There is only a limited number of work-terms in my program (5). If I decided to do an 8 month term, I will only have 2 left (one in fall and other in summer). If I were to go back to school for the spring-summer, I will have three terms remaining (one in fall, and the last 2 *both* in summer). Now onto the real problem, I really want to do an internship at a FAANG -level company and I think I have a shot at it. And for some reason, I'm convinced that my chances at securing such position will dramatically increase if I were to apply for a summer term.     


Essentially it's this: good guaranteed opportunity costing me one summer term chance at Big Tech v.s  passing on a good opportunity for the reward of one extra summer chance at Big Tech.

560,Work announced RTO. I don’t feel comfortable moving into such a high COL area when I feel always on the edge of PIP,11op8vb,"Took a job in September. During work, I noticed that the work culture was _insane_ (10-12 hours a day, always expected to be available). I also felt I constantly, always received negative feedback. It didn’t matter how much I did right or how much I produced. 

I think part of this stems from a very… toxic feeling culture. Everyone seems very on edge, overworked, and really spread thin. The expectations for everyone seemed to be a lot more than just what their job titles implied. The biggest red flag to me was when I told my mentor “I’m really trying but I can only do so much”, and he told me that he understands because he _got in yelling arguments in the office_ with my manager. I thought this might just be hyperbole, until I started seeing people be really rude and aggressive on public calls, singling out individuals 

Anyway, my manager in 1:1s, basically since I started, has implied that I am doing very poorly and am right on the edge of a PIP. He phrased it like “I really don’t want to but you’re close”. Because of this, when my lease expired, I didn’t feel comfortable renting a new place cause I always had an underlying feeling that I was gonna be fired the next day and I moved in with my parents or couch surfed or rented airbnbs. Basically homeless, tbh

Work announced a return to office and now I’m afraid. The places I’ve been staying would be a huge commute to the office, like 2+ hours a day. Places in relative walking/public transit accessible to the office costs 3k minimum.

568,Career shift: from Data Engineer to more general Software Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer? In this economy?!,11ome7i,"**MY STORY SO FAR**:

* Master’s degree in math.
* 7 YOE in roles labeled either ""data scientist"" (DS) or ""data engineer"" (DE). TBH, the DS roles have felt like DE roles (no building of statistical models, more focus on dashboards, SQL, data warehouses). 
* Currently DE at FAANG.  Been at this job since 2021.

**ISSUES AT THE MOMENT**:

* **I find the job uninteresting.** I've never been super passionate about DE work – I got into it because the interviews were easier compared with DS interviews, and the positions were more plentiful. This job is especially boring as it's mostly building dashboards or chasing down DS and SWE partners to instrument logging or figure out what to put in the dashboards.
* **I see limited growth potential at my current company.** I should clarify that I feel fortunate to have this job in the first place, and I know I’m compensated well (in the grand scheme of things). At my current company, I've seen many people get promoted to 1 level above me, but I see very few DEs who are 2+ levels above me. Here, DEs are paid less than SWEs (at equivalent levels). I am concerned that the limited focus of the work, combined with using primarily in-house tools, will make my skills less transferable later.
* **I might get laid off soon.** We've had mass layoffs and we will likely have more, and there is increased pressure to PIP people. In my most recent performance review, I was rated sub-par, so I think that makes me more vulnerable.
* **The economy is not doing so hot.**  Yeah yeah yeah, we all know.  I originally wrote a draft of this post before the Silicon Valley Bank mess.  I understand that things kinda suck right now, but I’m trying to think about my career 5-10 years in the future, and I don’t want to have regrets because I took the “safe” path just staying in my lane and keeping my head down.

**WHAT I WOULD LIKE IN MY FUTURE CAREER**:

* Build up my general SWE skills. I've started going through the curriculum on teachyourselfcs.com, and I do enjoy reading and doing the exercises in SICP.
* Build up my stats & ML skills. Even though my education was math-heavy, I'm still kinda light on stats. I have started reading ""Intro to Statistical Learning with R"" to fill in some gaps, and I intend to move on to teaching myself PyTorch.
* Work in an area that hopefully uses more math, or at least an area that solves more interesting problems.
* Work in an area that's relatively lucrative with significant growth potential.

**POTENTIAL PATHS FORWARD**:

* **Apply for jobs as an ML Engineer.** This would be a big leap at the moment since I still need to build up experience with a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow, and the job market is especially competitive. I do have experience in data at a FAANG company, and I have a STEM graduate degree, so maybe that would help me get my foot in the door at a smaller lower-paying company. Not actually sure, just guessing here. But I wouldn’t want to take a job paying less than $150K. 
* **Look for DE jobs, but aim for ones that have a broader scope.** Maybe something like a ""full-stack data scientist"" role where I would be doing both DE work and ML work.
* **Apply for SWE jobs.** Maybe I could apply for backend jobs that are more data-adjacent (to get my foot in the door), or I could look for SWE  jobs that interface more directly with ML, or specialize in some other interesting topic.

**QUESTIONS**:

* **Q1**: Has anyone here switched job titles from data engineer to machine learning engineer? Or from data engineer to more general software engineer? Do you feel it was worth it?
* **Q2**: Am I right in thinking the career path for data engineers is a bit more stunted compared to other areas in tech? Maybe I have that perception because, at my company, pay for DEs is lower compared to SWEs, and there are fewer people at higher levels. But maybe that's a myopic view. My girlfriend has tried to convince me not to fully abandon the DE path, pointing out how DEs are sometimes paid as much as SWEs  at other companies, and there is still a lot of demand for DEs.
* **Q3**: In case people here think ML is overhyped (which it probably is, though I find it interesting), are there other areas of tech that people with math backgrounds have found enjoyable?

571,How long do your prod releases take?,11oioxd,"I feel like I’m going nuts but I need some perspective. 

Almost 4 years into my first job after college. Was previously working on our legacy app system- that takes ~3-4 hours to deploy with minimal human interaction.

Now I’m working on the new shiny “better” system and it takes at least 10 hours to finish a deployment. Which is down a lot from the 20 or so hours it used to take. Even an emergency patch takes a good 5 or 6 hours to deploy. Most releases they line up 12-20 devs from all the various teams to be on call in case something blows up.

Am I wrong to feel like this is really excessive? It’s not often I have to be on call but I dread it because the on call period is so long and there’s almost always some problem that needs fixing. Wondering what the norm is in other companies.",lampshadelampshade,44,25,0.94

578,Not sure how I did on my tech assessment,11oeaa0,"I just had my first ever tech assessment for a job. It was for a .NET job. They told me I could solve it with a console app, a WPF app or any other kind of app.

The assignment arrived five minutes late when I had just called the number of the guy supervising. I saw the mail come in and could cancel the call.

The mail said to confirm I got it and I commented it arrived five minutes late. I got a reply saying that he knew with a smiley face. Was that a part of the test? Should have tried to phone earlier? I found this odd. He had told me the sending of the mail was automated.

Anyhow, the test was 8 question out of which I had to do two. They were WPF assignments. I just picked the first one and went to work without looking at the others. I did good on that one and did the second one. Because I'm quite unfamiliar with WPF I made a bit of a mess of this one and took more time. I ended up hard coding stuff I didn't want to in an ugly way because I didn't know how to interact with the xaml in a more sensible way so I could just iterate over some elements.

I got the first two questions solved and working though.

I then managed to do a third question too figuring it might get me bonus points. I sent in my results in time and am now waiting for an answer from them.

My aim is the UK (specifically London because I really love the idea of living in London), Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland. 

I understand .NET is quite popular in those countries, but what I can do in my spare time to maximise my chances of landing a job offer in the above countries? 

I am currently learning Go because its mostly used for backend and to land a job offer because of its rarity. I was planning on contributing to some of the larger Go open source projects like Docker or CoachroachDB to put on my resume. However most Go BE positions I’ve seen are more than willing to take you, even without Go experience. So is my time wasted learning Go? Or could that be seen as an argument to keep learning Go, since they would take someone with Go open source experience than someone without?

I would ideally like to move into the JVM ecosystem and out of the “Microsoft tech stack” (C#, .NET, SQL Server, Azure etc.) that a lot of .NET companies seem to fall into. Should I rather build some SpringBoot projects with some GraphQL, Kafka etc. technologies added in and put it on my resume? Could I give some Scala a go?

I understand that specific technologies don’t really matter, but tonnes of companies in Europe (and including where I am from) mostly believe in “{specific tech stack} engineer” instead of “software engineer”. 

I am just wanting to build something or contribute to something to add on my CV to show that I can build things in their tech stack to maximise chances of landing a job offer

My current challenge is Machine Learning which I've learned using Yolov5 but not creating it by myself.

Do you think my experience is good enough to work if I don't get into the University of Minnesota to take a gap year for example or because I'm still young go to something like the University of Minnesota Duluth (got accepted as safety school) and try to transfer?

I thought I was delivering a lot and was putting in long days and some weekends to get things done, but in a reasonable manner without completely killing myself, I think. Is work-life balance even real, ha). Still, it doesn’t make sense and I’ve really looked at my actions and tried to see how I could learn from this and what I could have possibly done wrong or differently. Still coming up empty and my former colleagues are confused as well. At this point, I’m trying to not be upset at what happened and just move on despite the huge blow and uncertainty around how much being fired has set me back in my career. 

All that being said, in retrospect I should have negotiated and asked to be laid off instead, but I was too paralyzed by the sheer 180 in my reality. Overnight my boss and I went from having what I thought was a good relationship to one of complete judgement with him seeming almost giddy after giving me the axe.

I was fired/terminated/let go for being a bad performer but I promise that’s bs and I’m a great senior engineer! Hire me!” Ugh. It feels awful to even have to defend myself and I feel very low and unjustly labeled. My confidence is shot. It also sucks because I have almost 8 years of experience and was always a highly respected engineer who was known for their work quality and ethic. At previous companies I was also promoted and received bonuses pretty regularly based on my good performance, sigh.

Despite having a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, I'm finding it difficult to land even an interview for a junior web developer position. I've been applying to various job listings on job portals like Indeed, Glassdoor, and ZipRecruiter, but to no avail.

One of the challenges I face is that many entry-level job postings seem to require several years of experience in a multitude of programming languages. This makes it difficult for new developers like myself to gain the necessary experience to get hired.

I'm passionate about coding and always eager to learn more. In fact, I've been teaching myself React on the side to increase my skillset.

Since I live in Algeria, I'm primarily looking for a remote job opportunity. Do you have any advice on where I can find remote job listings? And do you have any suggestions on how I can improve my chances of landing a remote job as a junior web developer?

I'm open to any suggestions or feedback that anyone has to offer. Thank you in advance for your time and help.

633,Did I mess up my carrier after 20 years? Is it the job market? Not sure how to move forward.,11npvc1,"TLDR at the bottom.

Hello everyone,

I have a feeling that I might have messed up my career after 20 years. From 2000 to 2020 I worked as an engineer doing C/C++/Linux development. I was quite good at it. From 2011 to 2020, I worked at one of the top 20 engineering companies in the world. Back in those days, I would get 10+ recruiters reach out to me a week on LinkedIn. 

--

In 2020, my team got laid off. I decided to follow my friends footsteps who was making more money while traveling the world by doing freelance web development jobs. I had another close friend with 15 years of front end development experience join me. I learned Django and started doing back-end. He was doing front-end using React. 

--

Soon after I started my company, one of my parents got diagnosed with Dementia and the other one got diagnosed with Alzheimer and heart problems. I moved back to my country of birth to help them however I can. By mid 2022, I had only developed 3-4 sites for clients using Django and I had no front-end experience.

--

Mid 2022, an old coworker who knows my work ethics and the quality of my work reached out to me and asked me if I wanted to work with him once more in the company he was working at. I told him about my obligations towards my family and he assured me that I would not need to work more than 40 hours a week.  He was a manager at that company. I told my lack of coding in the last 2 years and he suggested that I should take the interview anyways. He was confident that I could breeze through the interview given my past experience. 

--

I was hired to do back-end rest API, pretty much basic CRUD. The problem is that, a month after I was hired my old coworker quit and we had a new manager. For some reason new manager decided that I would be a good match for infrastructure. I asked for a few days to think about this and do a little bit of research on infrastructure. I was told I should make the decision ASAP. I made the decision after 15 minutes of google search. 

--

I accepted the new role and started working in infrastructure. I spent the last 8 months doing infrastructure there. Last month we decided to separate ways because my responsibilities at the company required me to work around 50-60 hours a week, I was making mistakes with infrastructure, and if I was not confident something was not the right way to do it I delayed the project instead of doing something I did not understand.

--

For the last 3 weeks, I am trying to land new jobs and nobody is calling back. For C/C++/Linux development jobs I think I'm not receiving calls because I did not do any of these skills for the last 3 years.
For Django jobs, I think I'm not receiving any calls because I have only done 5-6 projects with Django.
For infrastructure jobs, I think I'm not receiving any calls because I only have 8 months of experience and no certificates.

--

At this point, I do not know what to do. Should I sharpen my C/C++/Linux skills and keep applying for those jobs? Should I sharpen my Django skills and keep applying for those jobs? Should I sharpen my infrastructure skills and keep applying for those jobs? I have no idea what to do next.

--

**TLDR**: I did C/C++/Linux for 20 years. Then I did Python/Django on and off for 2 years with only 4 clients. Then I did 9 months infrastructure/Terraform/Docker/Kubernetes/AWS. Nobody is returning my applications on LinkedIn for the last 3 weeks. Is it my experience being all over the place in the last 3 years? Is it the job market? Which skill should I focus?

651,"Got accepted into a boot camp, but I'm still worried",11niksd,"Hi everyone, just got accepted into a boot camp but I wanted to hear some opinions and advice on how I should proceed going forward.

Here's some background info on my current situation: I've attended some college, but dropped out so I have NO degree at all. My resume as of now is just a couple of years of restaurant experience. I don't plan on attending the boot camp until later this year, maybe in July (mostly because of the job market from what I hear). Happy to provide more details if necessary.

I guess what I'm worried about is that it seems like I probably won't be a desirable candidate for companies even after graduating from a boot camp specifically because of the lack of a college degree. So I am leaning towards pursuing a bachelor's at an online school like WGU as well (would be in CS). Which leads to some questions:

Should I do one or the other? Or should I do both? Would it look bad on my resume to do both? What would you do if you were in my shoes?

It feels weird because it felt like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders after getting into the boot camp, but now I feel even more uncertain about the future. Any opinion would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",ejvibes19,4,0,0.5

Most companies listed their compensation half or less than half of what I used to get. I am getting demotivated and am confused if I should or shouldn't devalue myself by joining a work with less compensation.

I know it is risky, but the company offering the internship is extremely well-regarded (FAANG level or above) and was willing to fly me overseas for the internship. I doubt that I would ever have such an opportunity again, and to be honest, being able to relocate would allow me to leave an abusive family situation. On the other hand, the first company is also quite good with an extremely nice culture and team.

659,"Should I finish my MSCS ASAP, or spend the summer on projects?",11ngefe,"Hi all, I'm a career changer currently doing Georgia Tech's OMSCS. I have one class left, and the option of finishing either this summer or this fall. I'm currently searching for internships but not having much luck. If I do get one, I'll just focus on the internship this summer and finish my program in the fall. That's easy enough to figure out. 

My question: if I don't get an internship, *should I skip the summer term and finish in the fall anyway*? Given that the job market isn't so hot and my resume seems not to be good enough to get me interviews, would it be better to spend the summer working on projects, contributing to OSS if possible, and grinding LC? That way I have the ""excuse"" for a work gap of still being in my program. 

If I finish in the summer, then the clock starts sooner on the work gap and I won't have as much time to pad my resume and hopefully get more interviews. On the other hand, I wouldn't have to think about the program at all anymore and could start full-time employment immediately if offered. (My main worry about the work gap isn't financial; it's employers assuming that if I'm not employed I'm not worth employing.)

## Background

He is a mechanical engineer. He worked for a few years and wasn't a fan of the kind of work. He went on a long hiatus (3 years) without working at all. Now, he's working in a non-engineering job but is looking to get back into engineering.

Specifically, he's interested in CS and doesn't want to get into mechanical engineering. 

## My Advice

Given the fact that he has no programming background, I thought it'd be good to take a CS 101 course from a community college. Imo, Data Structures & Algorithms is extremely important so I recommended that he should take that from a university. 

So, take CS 101 course + Data Structures & Algorithms. This should get him some coursework under his belt. I can help him with any questions on the side. After that, Leetcode practice for interviews. 

I thought this was a good way to go. I realize that he'd be missing computer architecture courses and other good stuff that can be useful but it's something he can learn as he goes. But the other 2 courses should get his foot in the door.

There's a thing I'm trying to define. I can describe it with examples, or a lot of explanation, but I'm writing this post to see if it has a name. Some kind of handle I can use to research more about it or more easily discuss it.

I've fallen into a role as a lead on a team wherein every other developer is an offshore contractor. Not ideal, I know, but that's not really what the post is about. These folks are intelligent, hardworking, and experienced, but there's a certain collection of skills and priorities that they lack that has been frustrating me to no end. It's like a laziness, but one that applies only to concerns of readability and maintainability.

For example, they might find that to resolve a story they can modify a function GetAllX so that it only gets certain X. Now it no longer gets ALL X, but they don't rename it. The function signature will be a lie to the next developer who reads it.

They won't refactor large, convoluted functions. Just keep adding little by little story by story until it becomes a monster.

They leave comments because I tell them to, but they don't seem to really \*get\* what makes a comment valuable or when/why a comment might be valuable.

They'll use multi-line ternary operators and large conditions you need a pen and paper to understand.

I'm tempted to say ""maintainability"" or ""readability"" but those don't feel quite right. It's almost more like ""empathy"". The ability to put yourself in the shoes of the next guy who has to work with the code you're writing.

Ultimately, sometimes he changes app's code that break things without informing others, only we discover later. Also, i did unit tests for his code.

686,Recent full stack bootcamp graduate feeling extremely disheartened.,11n1u80,"
*** PLEASE, NO RUDE COMMENTS. ***

I have been feeling incredibly discouraged lately after graduating from a full stack coding bootcamp December 2022. I have been actively applying for jobs, networking on LinkedIn, and attending hiring/networking events, but nothing seems to stick. I've been attempting to make the transition to software engineering for almost three years now. Since then, my brother passed away, a friend committed suicide, and I've isolated myself. Depression is not new to me and I've had major depressive disorder since I was 14. During the bootcamp, and even a month after graduating, I had so much hope and thought that this was finally my chance to change my life around and accomplish something that I've always wanted to do, but I'm losing hope.

If you have any advice, I'd sincerely appreciate it. 🙏 



Here's my story for reference:

Growing up in a disadvantaged family and community, I was not exposed to the opportunities and resources that would have allowed me to pursue a career in tech earlier in my life. Amongst my childhood peers, I was the only one to obtain a college education, so I consider myself incredibly fortunate.

Despite a poor education, I’ve always harbored fascination for STEM. To enrich my knowledge, I’ve been re-teaching myself math fundamentals in my spare time. I vividly remember ranting to my younger brother about how much I wanted to learn how to code and, although we had grown apart for years, he encouraged me to turn my dreams into reality. Unfortunately, my brother passed away a few months later. But, his words of encouragement reignited my passion and reaffirmed the potential I had to achieve my dreams. I have since remained adamant in my pursuit of finally becoming a software engineer.

A year after graduating with a bachelor's in biochemistry, I started by taking an introductory computer science course at a community college and used that as evidence of my commitment to pursuing a career in software engineering. I was then accepted into a bridging master's program spring 2022, but quickly realized that the professors expected a strong computer science background. I was advised to drop the program and found myself feeling lost and defeated.
It wasn't until discovering Hackbright Academy's bootcamp that I felt a glimmer of hope again. The program rekindled my sense of hope, and I was excited to develop my skills alongside other like-minded individuals. 

The bootcamp was sponsored by a large well-known company. For three years, they had a 100% success rate of converting every grad from the sponsored cohorts into full-time employees. Well, due to poor Q4 earnings, that was no longer a possibility and we were led to believe that we’d be hired on until two weeks before the end of the program when the bomb was dropped. It goes without saying that I felt crushed at this news. 

Prior, I thought that this program was FINALLY my shot at achieving something I’d been wanting to do for a long time, but didn’t quite know how to go about doing. Now, we’ve all just been left to the wolves with little support.


TLDR: I graduated at December 2022 and have been actively applying for jobs, networking on LinkedIn, and attending hiring/networking events, but nothing seems to stick. Tips appreciated.",Veggielovr2,18,0,0.5
687,Need help setting expectations for first promotion.,11n1pfa,"Hey everyone!


I’m a SWE I at a large retailer and have been at this role full time for about 10 months. I have 2.5 years previously at this company as a SWE intern and my engineering manager will take this into account for how quickly I will become a SWE II (or so he says at least).


I’ve never had a real promotion before so I’m looking into the future a few months. I have a review with my manager at the end of this month and I’m hoping to plant the seed that I am looking for a promotion soon. I have been trying to do the responsibilities of a SWE II the past few months, mostly taking responsibility for new services we spin up and becoming the domain master of those services. 



How else should I justify myself for wanting a promotion or will that even be a concern (maybe he will just assume I’m looking for one because of how long I’ve been here?) 


Lastly, I want to set realistic expectations for the compensation increase going from SWE I to SWE II. I currently make 85k salary, 93k total (bonus is flat 10% of salary which tracks with your salary increases). Is it unrealistic to ask for 105k or even 110k salary. Can you even negotiate for a promotional raise?

695,"Working at a small non-tech company (~20 people), poorly organized, unconventional tech stack. Is being here a poor choice for my career?",11mz0p8,"I've been anxious about a career decision and wanted to get some opinions.

I graduated college in 2018. My first job was at a large, well-known, logistics company, starting in 2019. I became proficient in Angular, C#/.NET Core, got used to CI/CD, etc...we had hundreds of thousands of users. It was stressful, but felt important. Had a big team.

Fast forward to April 2022. I quit that job because of poor work-life balance. I started a new one that has, culture-wise, been mostly great. People are super nice, catered lunches happen all the time, practically zero stress, great flexibility to work in-office or remote.

Problem is, the company is so disorganized. The company barely uses Slack and meetings rarely happen. I don't feel like I have actual deadlines. Typical performance reviews don't really happen. I'm one of two software developers. The SaaS platform I work on isn't our biggest revenue source at the moment. Non-tech employees don't seem to care much about the vision or future of the tech side of the company (aside from C-suite people), and most of them are hourly. Our platform is not nearly as widely used as my previous job, but I have the freedom and decision-making power to implement pretty much whatever we decide.

Right now, I work with Elixir and React Native w/ a Postgres DB + deploying w/ CI/CD pipelines.

My ultimate question is, can I stay at a job like this for a while (a job that doesn't practice Agile standards, a job where I am not surrounded by a team of more experienced engineers to learn from) and still be marketable in the field? Is it impressive for other companies that I have been able to essentially manage IT and feature development to drive revenue for a company that does about ~20M a year? I stick to the conventions best I can - write tests, clean code, plan features out, model DB when necessary.

It just doesn't 'feel like a job' and I wonder if this is bad. Excuse me if I seem naive. I'm 27.

So I'm wondering what's the upside of knowing this stack... I never got into Azure and what not.

It's good for the resume but I've primarily been on JS/rails side. Never felt the desire to learn C#.

In the long run I'm trying to leave software/gui stuff that's not involved with hardware (as in automated agriculture).

Maybe C# would be good for that? I'm not sure, looking for thoughts.

My job is a good one as far as pay/remote but topics-wise I intend to leave after 2 years provided I find something new. I accepted this job because I was desperate at the time (broke), immediately accepted first offer.

**reason for discussion**

I told them I would be willing to learn but that I would be slow... since I have no experience.

But we're in a conversation like ""you have to decide if you want to do it or not... otherwise we'll find somewhere else for you to go.""

I think going from C# to JS is easier than vice versa.

Any tips?,11mvlkf,"Basically, my work history is really spotty with a 1.5yr gap after college, and then I went into a helpdesk job at a Managed Service Provider (basically an IT contractor for helpdesk) for over a year, then went back into programming at another place for 4 months, and then was at the last job as a software developer for a year at that same Managed Service Provider and since then there's been a 6 month gap where I've been unemployed.

So I'm wanting to try and find a job I can stay at for 3-5 years, and I want it to get me closer to a Cloud Engineer/Devops position.

I think I really struggle in a purely dev position due to ADHD and it being hard to maintain interest in programming 100% of the time for my technical work (and meetings but I hated meetings), but I still enjoy programming and think I'd rather have it be more scripting and fixing bugs that's preventing the code from deploying. My favorite part of dev was getting my code to deploy and I had a blast playing around with Docker and Kubernetes and I absolutely love being on a linux shell which made building docker images and hoping on the GCP's linux shell lots of fun. And from Helpdesk I enjoyed writing powershell and doing the AD/DS and Google Admin stuff, and I enjoyed the ticket format because they're short straightforward tasks and knowing that a user can't do their job and needs my help is very motivational for me to get that done asap. So that's why I was thinking something more along the lines of the Cloud or maybe DevOps.

717,What’s my job title?,11mv01c,"I’ve been working for over 1.5 years in the role. This is my first job in the tech field. I get paid 98k. Here is a short list of my responsibilities:

- bug and defect root cause analysis
- triage bug and defect tickets made by nontechnical staff
- fix bugs and defects when able to
- work closely with QA team to ensure adequate testing — occasionally writing tests 
- one person role


I write code, dig through the code base, but I only fix bugs and defects. It’s meant to be a temporary role at my company, and there is word of me moving over to the product engineering team. However, our company is having some hard times and we lost a lot of product managers, so it’s possible that this move will be delayed. 

My current title doesn’t represent my role well. Management is happy to change my title to whatever makes sense, which I think will help me when it comes to applying to new roles. Currently it’s difficult to apply to anything but junior level roles, but I feel I’m significantly more skilled than a junior level… though I’m not sure I really qualify for mid level.

718,Awkward Question,11mud0g,"After 40 years of working menial jobs, I decided to go to school and get a computer programming degree. Upon graduation, I landed my first job as an Associate SE working 100% remote making more money than I ever have before.

But here's where things get weird. I am the most junior person on my squad obviously, but it feels like I do more work than anyone else. It feels like more senior people are looking for reasons to call their stories blocked, while I'm knocking out 3-4 pull requests per sprint and when I find a block, if I know how, I simply unblock myself.

The question is it takes me on average about 8 hours per sprint (2 week period) to do all my work and then pull in additional PRs from the backlog. I barely do any work it feels like and make more money than any other job I've ever had, where they want every second of their 40 hours for that minimum wage and you better clock out if you are even going to scratch your balls.

I'm mostly working with React/Typescript and this role was for Angular. Either ways the interviewer said it wasn't important, as the important thing was that I knew how to program. 

We had some javascript questions, mainly about how javascript works, given some examples, done some coding together.

So far fine. The end of the test was 2/3 questions about CSS. He asked me to say how display:block works and display:block-inline. 

The only thing that came to my head was that one would display all the child elements horizontally and the other didn't. Either way I told him I mostly use flex nowadays and mostly with use align-items, justify-content I can get things done. I said I knew there were a lot more display properties, like grid, table but I haven't used them often. 

At the end we even discussed that I could work in the middleware that was written in C#. 

Then the feedback I got, was that I wouldn't advance, because: 

“JS part was pretty good. All tasks were resolved. There were some issues with *this*, but the rest was great. Good understanding of event loops. Find duplicates problem was resolved with hints.

CSS wasn’t that great, doesn’t have understanding of selectors specificity. Doesn’t know how inline/block work.

No experience with Angular.

I wouldn’t say that no Angular experience by itself is an issue. But in that case I expected the JS and CSS part to be great. It is a case with JS, however CSS part is a bit week.”

731,How realistic is it to have a side career / second job in tech? I'm a flight attendant currently pursuing a computer science degree. I'm interested in possibly keeping my job and supplementing my income.,11mkzwc,"I like my job other than being paid peanuts. If I could do this part-time and have a second source of income, that would be ideal. It's easy to take extended time off and the travel benefits are fantastic. Every year that I gain seniority, I get a bit more control over my schedule.

That said, everyone in this industry seems to have a second job. I'm tired of being broke and I don't like flying full-time. I'm on my 5th year and things are getting better, but even if I stuck around until my pay is topped out (year 12), I'd be earning less than a junior software developer. 

Other than getting to travel, the job can be dull. It's about as mindless as work gets. Imagining growing old, doing only this, and not being able to retire until super late in life bums me out. Previously I worked for Apple for several years doing front-line sales (retail and home-based chat).

I'm 34 and never went to school when I was younger. I recently got an A.S. from a community college and took a few computer science courses along the way. I find the field exciting and interesting. I'm transferring credits into WGU and going that route for a C.S. degree. I want to have a plan B, and, after 6 months out of school, I find myself missing it. Even if I don't end up using the degree, I want to challenge myself and see if I can do it. I figure if I'm going to get a degree it might as well be in a challenging, in-demand field.

I'm also considering the idea of a full-on career change, but it would be a huge lifestyle adjustment. The airlines end up with a lot of lifer flight attendants cause once you pay your dues and start making a semi-living wage, you're six years in and afraid you'll regret quitting. I met a lady who flew for 25 years, quit, and missed it so much she came back at 1st year pay, being on-call 24 hours a day (as juniors are at my airline). I worry that I'd end up hating working in tech and regret my decision. Then again, you can afford a lot of plane tickets with these salaries...

I've read some posts on here that freelancing isn't realistic for a beginner and that part-time jobs don't really exist. Is this the consensus? Any advice on non-traditional ways to build a career in tech that would allow me to keep flying?",shhawkins,21,0,0.46

The second position is maintaining a large piece of software. I would work with one of the company's clients to provide support. I'd be debugging, backporting, patching, and testing, but not really developing new features. BUT the company culture was great.

**4:05pm**: After review, PM calls to discuss two new deliverables: table needs sort capabilities on all columns, a list-view variant needs to be developed, and these need  done for tomorrow's demo.

**4:15pm**: PM calls minutes later, asks for a third deliverable: Add a row to each table to shows the total.

Its a good job, but with no upward mobility and I have grown tired of the break/fix nature of IT. 

I started down this path about a year and a half ago with WGU with the eventual goal of getting a job doing some type of software development work. Since graduating I have started to look for jobs, but have started to be discouraged. Every job it seams have a 2+ year requirement, and im not finding truly entry level jobs.  The few entry level jobs seem to mostly be internships requiring you to be onsite. I'm for a lack of a better way of putting this an adult, with a house and bills and such and so I really can't see myself taking an internship and being able to afford to live!

I'm looking for advice on how to close that 2 year requirement, or is it just best to ignore that 2 year requirement and apply for the job anyways?

It's my first company after graduating in 2021. I did my bachelors from a NIT in Civil Engineering with a decent CGPA. Ya, feels like a joke thinking that at the moment, but the placement scenario was screwed for us, the COVID batch, but I was always into coding since my college days to make up for it. 

However, right now, there are two things that are bugging me - firstly, this project is offering zero growth. Initially they offered opportunities to build some value adds and all (built 2-3 using Spring Boot), but how long does one keep on building stuff for a test team? Daily works surround automation plus manual tests and they suck big time. 

Secondly, I was always very much into maths since my school days and after I watched some theory videos of the maths behind some of the ML models, been really into the entire AI/ML thing and have done several of courses around deep learning, NLP, and whatnot. Tried applying to several places for data scientist roles but everywhere I apply, they are always looking for CS grads which I am not. I am aware of the fact that masters help greatly in enhancing careers like this, but again, I am from a middle class family with my earning parents about to retire and I don't have a CS background in bachelors

I aso thought of going away from test role at first to some other big data based role (maybe around Kafka/Snowflake) and then try switching to data science but there is this thing - I think I am stuck in training hellhole. I always am fascinated in learning new stuffs but then, can't do anything after that. And at the end of the day, it's utterly frustating.

I swear I’m not a toxic employee, a majority of my past employers/internships I left on good terms and have positive relations with the references I got from there.

What should I do? My SO thinks I should add someone else’s number, someone without a voicemail and won’t pick up - as many references don’t respond anyways and the “prospect employers” don’t hold that against the interviewee when that happens.

I could also just not add these two when asked for my list of references, but again one is from 'my most “significant” or “noteworthy” former employer'.

But oddly enough, they all have had more years of experience than me when they start.

It’s taking a toll on me because obviously I have to assign work to them but the amount of teaching that I have to do is getting frustrating. There’s not one person who was ever able to do something all by themselves even after almost a year and there wasn’t any work that I didn’t have to either walk them through or eventually rework.

I am currently working in a small development company (almost a startup). I was hired as a developer and overall everyone has been pleased with my work. Since we are such a small team, we sometimes 'wear' the 'hat' that we are assigned to. 

Since I previously worked in another sector (non-dev) I have been helping management with establishing potential sales leads and a sales pipeline. I dedicate about 10 to 20% of my time to those sales related tasks. Recently management brought in an designated sales person. What started as a collaboration on most of the processes that I have developed regarding sales, has slowly evolved to a situation where this person basically does nothing and only sweeps in at the last moment to make the landing. E.g. a few hours before our weekly general meeting, me and the sales person have a sales call. Afterwards at the general meeting, the new sales person just presents everyone the new leads that were established, copying the notes I handed him at our meeting. The same goes for actually landing clients.

Looking back, I am kicking myself a bit. It is clearly that I have played my cards badly and not capitalised on the work I have put in. Eager to take on whichever work comes my way, I have slowly submitted myself to a subordinate relationship with this new sales person. I am dedicated to the growth of the company and team collaboration is important on that level, but then I prefer a more equal partnership colaboration, rather then this new sales person suddenly profiling himself as my manager, without any decision from management in that direction.

786,Giving notice and background checks,11lz7t0,"I am an IT/CS person. I am asking this here as other industries may be different. 

So, whenever I get an offer letter, it says something like ""We are offering you this pretty new gig contingent upon you passing some stuff, like background checks, drug tests, etc. Your new start date is x/x/x"".

So I always reply ""I accept this wonderful offer but I plan to give 2 weeks notice at my current job and I cannot do that until the contingencies are satisfied. This will possibly alter the start date.""  

I don't actually worry about drug tests as I control that (I don't do drugs so it's easy). If it is something I do not control (i.e. background check), I do not give my notice until it is complete. I have no idea what they are going to check, who they are going to talk to, or even what information would cause them to rescind the offer. 

I have done a lot of background checks over the years and never had an issue. I have worked for multi-national banks and had a government clearance. So I don't think there should be an issue. But since it is completely opaque, I don't give notice until complete.

Most background checks take just a few days. But I have had push back from companies that want me to start in 2 weeks and companies where the background checks took a long time. I always push back and they can either move the start date to give the time needed, or they can rescind the offer.

So I am a software developer. I honestly don't think I am even average in it myself but my clients, employers, collegues all say I am one of the best minds in software development they have worked with. My last employer, I worked for him for 2 years and wished to continue but all of a sudden he would low key threaten me to transfer all my skills to couple of his relatives. I learned and honed my skills literally by getting my hair and beard white busting my ass working 18 hours a day 6 days a week in my early days.

So when I was asked to 'transfer knowledge' also without any incentive I resigned and never looked back.

Got a new job better pay with current employer. Where I am the sole developer. 2 years are completed and now there's this talk of training a junior guy who will take the burden away from me shit. I don't mind if someone trained comes and join me but I am anal about teaching someone my skills. 

There's a big chance I will leave my current employer too. What's with same pattern and why with me?

I low key told my current employer that the junior can take classes do small projects prove himself and here and there if he gets stuck I can assist like how managers do but to build.

I've been out of a job for four months - awfully long - and I've been more or less continuously trying to improve my skills. I have hopes and expectations about my next job when it comes to salary and more importantly the ability to work remote, yet I'm not going to turn down a job just because it doesn't satisfy that. Realistically, I'll just continue to look for something better and quit it as soon as I can.

However, this would put me with the recruiting agency's bad graces, I imagine, and they would possibly not want to work with me the next time I need a new job (although there are plenty, so whatever).

Yesterday, I was reached out to by a recruiter for a position that is not as remote as I would like, and I implied that I would prefer something with more flexibility. If this were a specific corporation, I wouldn't care about being lying about my expectations and then quitting as soon as I could. I imagine the same would be for a recruiter to whom I had sent an application, but one who had reached out to me? I feel like they have less of an incentive to working with me, so what would they care?

&#x200B;

I think the ideal plan would be to tell the recruiter that I am interested in the job and will work toward getting it, but definitely prefer something with a more flexible remote policy, leaving out the bit that I would quit for a new job the moment I found one with said remote policy.

Hey everyone, I'm new to posting here but been subbed to here for a while. 

I graduated with the BS of CS in 2018, and about a year later ended up landing a job as a programmer for the state I live in. I was pretty lucky I think to get the gig, since I had no experience, but I chalk that up to general soft skills during the interview.

The job is good and I've learned a lot, but I think I'm going to have to move to another job if I want to make competitive pay. I've started cooking up a resume since I lost my old one, but I literally have nothing that would make sense to put in a 'projects' section. Since I work in the government, I can't really point to any actual examples of my code since all of the work I have done is for internal facing projects. Coding is not a hobby to me, and while I like doing it for work I have no desire to make stuff in my free time.

 Is it alright to not have that stuff on a resume, or would that negatively affect me enough in my prospects to warrant making stuff on the side just to show off for a resume?

Shit is wild.

I'm in need of some advice of people who are in the industry. Thought this sub might be good.

I've (F20s) been at my current employer for 3 years now, started as a junior. However I've been quite unhappy for a while now and decided to start looking for a different job and found one that is a better fit. I still have four more months on my contract.

Since then everything has changed at my current employer. 

My direct boss has stopped talking to me - on most days I can be happy if I get a reply to a simple question. He has taken over my work, doesn't tell me anything and is using me as his personal secretary (asking people things he could be asking himself). It's annoying as the tickets are still assigned to me and it looks like there is no progress.

You guys, he doesn't even LOOK at me anymore. 

Like, I spent yesterday just laughing at the absurdity of it all. This is a man in his FORTIES and he acts like my 5 yo nephew.

I've obviously not just been sitting on my ass and not doing anything. I take that time to study and further my knowledge (finally doing all my Udemy courses).

The main issues I have right now are:
- I kind of want to confront him but then might lose my sweet, sweet paid time for personal study 
- I want to talk to my bosses boss about why my time tracking shows that I have been entertaining myself before he comes to me
- I want to do none of those things because I might lose my sweet, sweet paid time for personal study

The wildest part is I have seen him do this VERY similar thing to a partner company. Like he STOPPED talking to them and would not even answer the most basic questions.

I told one of my coworkers about all of this yesterday. He scoffed and said that it is ridiculous and childish but typical for our boss.
He told me it has happened to him MULTIPLE times.

Is this normal?? Like what is life even?? I legit started therapy (last year spring) because this job was making me more insecure by the second.

Of course I know that I have loads of stuff to learn, but I want to emphasize that I am more than ready for a Junior position writing code in C, Java, or Python.

My problems are two-fold: (1) no internships, and (2) not a people-person. I don't have any internships under my belt because I enrolled in CS out of interest and I didn't foresee myself trying to make a career out of it. But honestly, with the way the economy is right now, any good-paying job is necessary, and at this point I have the knowledge. I just don't have the on-hands experience.

In regards the second issue, I've had my fair share of teamwork. But it's not something I thrive in. I'm more interested in being alone with my mind than being with a team working on a product. I'm also just not generally well-spoken or communicative. I know that none of this translates well into an interview, much less a company culture. And I always hear employers say that they would rather hire candidate B, who is less skilled but more personable, over candidate A, who is more skilled but less personable.

I don't want to hear about my coworkers' personal lives, and I sure as hell don't want to tell them about mine.  I don't want to travel on-site, and I think that work social events are a colossal waste of time.  I believe teams should strive for maximizing productivity with as few meetings as necessary and that emails are an underrated tool.  

That's not to say I dislike the people I work with, but it's exhausting to pretend like these things are anything less than an annoyance at best and an encroachment of my personal boundaries at worst. Am I SOL?  I think at this point it seems like my choices are:

1. Work for myself

2. Change careers

3. Deal with it

820,Expecting interest rates increase. What does this mean for the tech industry?,11lj3zh,"Overall, the employment rate is at a historic low. That's not what it feels like in tech as there have been waves of layoffs starting with larger companies and smaller companies following their lead. 

Maybe these question would be better suited in r/economics but asking in case people have insight since I'm more or less asking about this specific to cs-careers. Some of the main questions below (others please feel free to hijack with other questions in comments):

* Are there specific industries/sectors that may continue to lay off workers until the Federal Reserve reverses their interest rate policies? For instance, some retail with normal goods is likely to take a hit with rising prices and consumers moving toward [inferior goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inferior-good.asp#:~:text=An%20inferior%20good%20is%20an,buying%20more%20costly%20substitutes%20instead.). 

* Are certain industries safer than others? I imagine those selling inferior goods like used book sellers or something like that will actually do quite well in these times.

* Will startups become riskier due to difficulty (more expensive) in borrowing capital? Is it more likely that can't find funding startups will fail in the next few years? What does this mean for job seekers? Should they avoid these opportunities if they cannot handle the risk?

Why am I asking these questions? As I and others search for tech jobs, it may be wise to to take answers to the above into account when applying.",AlternativeHole,10,0,0.45
821,Salary negotiation and securing the job,11lhur1, I think I'm about to have a final talk/interview with a company to get hired. I'm not sure how to prepare myself though and what to expect. I was communicated that they want to move forward with the hiring process but it sounded a bit vague. Idk whether they 100% want to hire me/I'm their top pick or whether they've narrowed it down to a few people and want to decide who they should hire based on this next interview. I'm assuming we're going to talk about salary and benefits which I'm also not sure how to approach and negotiate. They're also a startup so equity might be brought up in the discussion. On the job posting they've put a salary range so I'd love to get the upper end of that but it would also be my first tech job and I don't have other offers to leverage. Should I play it safe and ask for a number in that middle salary range? I want to ask for the upper end but I'm afraid they might pick someone else who will take less and I don't want to lose this oppurtunity. If I do ask for the upper end and they seem hesitant do I just let them know that I'm okay with less? Also I've heard that they work 40+ hours a week sometimes too. Any advice?

Our clients are unaware of this and of course they do not  budget such massive development, they have a reasonable budget for a custom made product. My issue as a dev is that I cannot create a quality product for our customers, I am always pressed to design everything to be configurable say like SAP or another platform like it. Our boss says it's not acceptable just to make a quality product for our client that is tailored to their needs, it must also be possible to ship that product to the next customer with minimal man-hour s an maximum reusability.

Despite being only an hour away, I chose to continue working remotely and have been doing so the last 2.5 years. However, in the past 6 months, I've faced social pressure to come into the office, while some team members working from other cities don't. 

Although the role is still advertised as remote, hybrid, or office-based, the social pressure makes me feel like I'm not being a team player. Recently, a team member asked me in a daily standup if I will come into the office since I ""have no excuse,"" which made me uncomfortable. It was unexpected and I felt like I had to address the elephant in the room when I said remote working just appeals.

I've been really anxious about the pressure to come into the office lately, even though I prefer working remotely due to productivity, sense of progress, and work-life balance. I don't feel like there's anything missing, I'm fulfilled, so I don't want to disrupt that.

But I haven't discussed my concerns with my manager as I fear it may seem like I'm just uncooperative.

I’m the newest on this team(9 months) and I’ve had to learn a lot on my own. Our code expert is a person with 2-3 yrs on their belt, they taught me the most. With this in mind, unfortunately our team is going to struggle sometimes. Especially when we use standup as interrogation, it’s a great way to start the day. Just lost an hour to standup today.

It’s getting so bad that I want to start standing up for my tms. That surely could cause friction between me and the lead, but I don’t want to sit and listen to my tms get chastised for 30 mins.

866,"I've worked in some toxic, shady startups in the past- would that actually prepare me for working in the more toxic big companies?",11kwltg,"I worked in some rather shady startup/small businesses. These places may not be big in scope in what they do, but several have been toxic/dysfunctional, and had to put up with it for much less pay than the big boys in tech. It might actually make me more prepared for the crap that Twitter, Uber, or Rainforest devs have to endure. But I'm not completely sure, which is why I ask.

* One of my first jobs I was the only dev, bus factor of one. I worked part-time and I was on-call- while I was still enrolled in college. Staying till 7 or 8pm on weekdays to finish stomping out some bugs was pretty common. I also had to show up one weekend without pay to set up office computers. One time I was working on a term paper when my boss called me up because a bug in their content system was messing with the writers' formatting, and I was expected to fix it or a writer might get fired. I kindly told them no, I need to finish homework, and didn't hear about the incident again.

* Another place, the boss was more chill, but everyone's paycheck came in late for the first three months I worked there. Probably the least severe of offenses here, actually. I'd say this was more lack of preparedness in running a business than toxic behavior.

* In one marketing agency I was misclassified as a contractor. I was 1099 but they expected me to show up 9-5 like full-time. As is with every other individual contributor at the company. The co-founder of the company made multiple excuses to workers as to why it was so hard to do the paperwork for hiring full-time people, but I just think it's about tax evasion. Management is all over the place and the company in general was a revolving door with high turnover. After quitting, in later company reviews I've read, the current CEO has made people cry by tearing them down.

* All these jobs had one thing in common too: They don't understand good workflows or development methodologies. Sometimes, there are interns solely responsible for a lot of $ on client accounts, and because they're interns they naturally make mistakes and a lot of client money is wasted. I'm not going to pretend everywhere in big tech is also squeaky clean when it comes to their own practices, either.

Having to grit my teeth for $12 to $25 an hour at these places, the thought of making upwards of $120k base salary where they are happily giving out PIPs to fire people, or where a sudden takeover lead to massive resignations, still sounds like an improvement to me. I had seen people resign the day I took their job for like a quarter of what Twitter employees are making.

But even with being in the trenches of companies doing questionable things, is it too foolhardy of an assessment to just go for the dregs of big tech if their salaries are still a lot higher than any place I've worked for? I know I'm not qualified to go for the best of big tech, might as well try out the less desirable tech companies while taking advantage of the higher (for me) salaries.

I apologize for the text wall, I'll try to paint the situation as best as I can.

----------

I am the tech lead of a dev team in a company with products varying from online stores to custom fullstack apps.

I noticed that roughly 40% of my team is missing knowledge in some areas that I believe to be fundamental for our work (or at least to architecture good and manageable solutions).
That means OOP concepts, some SW design principles, principles for clean code, benefits of using asynchronous/parallel code (and how to use it), basic relational DB design and other things.

I planned a series of ""lessons"" where these concepts are shown to everyone, so that each developer can be brought at the same level (and who already knows the topic can either refresh their memory on it or weigh in with comments).
Usually each presentation is held by a different member of the team that has that kind of knowledge or that will do research on it.

Eventually I would like to push more advanced topics, but there is a base that needs to be consolidated first (can't talk about interfaces when there are people that don't know how to design new classes).

This plan was brought to a halt by the team manager because ""it's not directly connected to what we do everyday"", and as such it doesn't produce any (short term) value, stating that if something is not used every day, it will be forgotten.
They said that every presentation has to be connected to something that happened (or that is happening) in our codebase - an example being a presentation on how to solve an issue with a modal in a very specific framework (which in my opinion is solvable by spending more time reading the documentation, and in any case it doesn't provide that much value...).
I've also been told that we are not in university and I really don't know how to to react to this phrase.

While I agree in part with that, I am more of the idea that it's easier to consider using a specific solution when you know it exists, rather than when you have no clue of its existence.

This specific manager is also not technical and I believe they don't have the correct knowledge to evaluate whether those notions are helpful or not.
I also don't think it's their role to decide on this, and since it's a technical decision it should fall under my responsibilities.

I feel like a bird with clipped wings: I have a role, but I'm not given the freedom to act on it to enrich my team in the way I think they would benefit.

If you were in my place, what would you do?
Would you go through with what you believe is right?
Or would you change the plan and do something you know it's going to keep the quality low?

877,I feel like my team is not being useful to the company,11kr9y3,"Hi everyone, I recently joined a company post graduation and have been working for a few months. My team apparently was formed only one month before I joined and only one month after I joined, my mentor left the company and I have become his replacement ever since.

So anyway, our team recently finished a product and want to roll it out for users. However, after having worked on it for 3-4 months, the product still doesn't feel like it will become a satisfying solution for our users. (We only have 2 devs working on the tool, me and my new mentor, and both of us are busy with multiple tasks so that's why it took so long). 

There are pressure from higher management to roll out this product as soon as possible to prove my team's worth (because there have been chatter about how my entire department, not just my team, is not providing much value even before I joined), but I feel like it still needs at least another month or two of testing and improvements. With the whole layoff scenario going on, I am very worried that all of my hard work just being pointless if the product keeps getting delayed, and layoffs might happen to me as well. I am constantly worried that maybe I have been dealt a bad hand and joined a team that does not contribute enough impact to the company, something that is very much out of my control.

Recently I’ve struck a deal with a friend and started doing some work for their company. It’s a .NET project with a few web pages and a SQL database, nothing crazy big but it’s fairly successful small business. However, I know basically nothing about maintaining a .NET project on a server; over the past month it’s been an absolute scramble to learn whatever bits and pieces I can from articles and the other project members. There’s only one other developer and he’s… to say the least, not happy that I’ve joined the project, so getting any mentorship is pretty much out of the question.

881,"As a SDE 2 with 7.5 YOE, would it be frowned upon to continue applying for SDE 2 roles?",11kpvwl,"For context, I worked at FAANG-1 (2.25 years), non-FAANG (4.25 years), and now FAANG-2 (1 year). I had an okay start of my career at FAANG-1 and probably could have gotten promoted to SDE 2 had I stayed, but I couldn't find teams looking for an SDE 1 at the time, so I left for non-FAANG.

Non-FAANG was the best decision for my career, as I actually got the time to refine my skills and become a solid, confident engineer, and worked with probably the best team and manager of my career thus far. The only downside of this is that it did take almost until year 5 of my career to get promoted to SDE 2, as I look at several of my friends' LI profiles at the time and realized that they were starting to get senior roles. I left last year for FAANG-2, and due to the perfect storm of personal life circumstances, lack of interest in cloud computing, and lack of responses for internal transfers, I am now applying for jobs.

My problem is that whenever I do reach out to recruiters, I always get bucketed into the Senior role with my YOE. I have plenty of design and E2E project experience, and can articulate what I've done, how I've done it, what my impact was, and challenges and compromises I faced along the way. The biggest issue I have though is that I don't have experience with large-scale designs (like leading the charge building a service or adding a large product feature), and I have only mentored one person at my last job (though it was a very good quality mentorship that went above and beyond what was expected of me). Because of these gaps, I feel like I am at a disadvantage compared to those with these on-the-job experiences.

I recognize there is more than one ""way"" to be a Senior engineer (via deep technical expertise). However, I also in general don't feel ready to be at the Senior level, and this is what I hate the most (maybe it's lack of confidence based on comparing myself to my friends, idk). There came a point where I clearly felt like an SDE 2 (despite my title at the time) given my accomplishments, and I have not reached that point for being a Senior Engineer **yet**. The general consensus I am getting is that SDE 2s at most companies are usually between 2-5 years of experience, and senior is 5+.

And worst of all, the system design interviews are a different breed of difficult. I applied to all senior positions except the one I am at now at end of 2021 and I did not pass a single System Design interview. It may be a matter of more and better prep, but they are definitely more difficult than any leetcoding I have ever done.

I guess my question now is, where do I go from here? Should I try to apply for SDE 2 roles or just prepare like hell for a Senior role?

I have been struggling at my current job because I have had consistently crappy assignments and keep getting reassigned before I can accomplish anything. The worst of them have been projects that required a vastly different skill set than what I have. Sometimes it's working on compliance stuff with absolutely no coding, or sometimes it's frontend React stuff even though it's been years since I did anything like that and we have better people for it (short handed after layoffs, smh). The one project that I was excited about in the last 6 months got tabled before I could finish it.

Basically it's been over a year since I had a really solid, visible win. I have contributed in many ways but it's been in support roles, mostly.

Anyway I am really tired of not being able to accomplish things that make me feel like I have earned my salary. It is so demoralizing to be lacking that satisfaction for so long and also be put on projects I am woefully unqualified for and basically set up to fail.

I try really hard not to let it impact my confidence. I think I am a pretty good engineer on the backend. I care a lot, I try to be fully invested in my projects and in professional standards, etc. I have the technical chops to match other  Senior devs on my team, etc.

897,How can I become less sensitive to my boss's comments?,11khtli,"Started a new job close to a year ago as a senior dev. This is the first position Ive had where my boss just really grates on me to the point that I lose focus and it kills my productivity. He LOVES to lecture. FWIW I'm a senior developer of close to ten years, have worked on more complicated projects than this.

A few examples:

1. Told me on my first pull request that it was too big. No big deal, but then lectured me about *why* programmers make commits small.
2. I broke up the commit as asked and received a lectured me about why small commits can be a problem and why I should make my pull requests bigger if the work is related. **This was AFTER the lecture mentioned in the previous point, regarding the same exact commit(s).**
3. Got a nitpick comment from a colleague that asked for a ""simple fix"" change to my commit. I said I felt the ask was outside of scope, and would also cause problems. Manager saw this exchange and verbally lectured me at my desk in front of others, *""Whenever a teammate has a suggestion for an easy clean up that would make our code better, it's okay to include it""* even though he had just previously given me a personal seminar against doing just that when I attempted to do so. As I anticipated, the ""minor change"" broke prod and I had to roll back.
4. When I was newer and reached out to him for help on blockers, I'd have to first suffer a lecture that I should reach out sooner when blocked. Even though I am maybe only blocked for an hour or two, and that's why Im reaching out NOW.
5. He will step in between two developers hashing out a disagreement on pull request, even if only 2-3 comments have been put out, to say things like, *""We have bigger fish to fry. Move on.""*
6. When blocked by a sister team, instead of just asking nicely for a data review, he swooped in on a pull request to condescendingly comment to them, *""Things can be simple for the people who have the right access to review this data. It can be a significant hurdle for the outsiders.""* which totally burned my connection on that team because the woman on said team was just sick of his shit.
7. I took time to dig into a relevant code and understand it before asking manager for help. I write up a summary to demonstrate my research, then presented it along with my question. I get a lecture, *""Code changes with time. Sometimes the code archeology can be helpful""*. He then literally regurgitates my findings and points me to git history tools as a way to discover this myself in the future, even though I already did this/know how.
8. I forwarded my PTO request to my team (per our convention) and had blocked my work calendar for PTO so that anyone who tried to book a meeting with me would know that I was out, but genuinely forgot to put the PTO in the ""team"" calendar. Got an email from him, *""MonkeeAndBanana, we are a team. As a team, it is useful to know when your colleagues are on PTO. Please add it to the team calendar.""* In my head I was seething. I didn't need this extrabullshit about being a team.

899,Moving on from being a Senior Software Engineer,11kh7na,"Hi all,

I've been doing software engineering for 10 years now (!) and now I feel like I've hit a dead-end in my career with no way sense of progression. I changed to a new job just under a year ago (launching a new product in the fintech space) and I've learned some new tricks in AWS which has been interesting and useful but it feels like all there is to do to gain a sense of ""progression"" is to learn yet another new technology which is the flavour of the month. This was fine for a while, but once you've learned enough programming languages, tools, methodologies it becomes rather unremarkable in my opinion.

I like the idea of being able to add value beyond just churning out lines of code. Therefore, I have been considering roles as a technical lead which I've tried to pivot to (and have expressed this desire to my manager in no uncertain terms) but there are plans to hire much more experienced technical leads who have been made redundant from other companies in the current ubiquitous tech layoffs. Because of this, I think this progression pathway is not looking too hopeful for me.

I'm at a loss for what to do at the moment. I'm open to exploring other roles but am not too sure what they are. Are there any other roles I should consider? Or, any advice for moving into a technical lead role (I have considered this role because it seems like a natural step towards something familiar but different)? Or is there anything else you think I should do?

Thanks!

My colleagues, who I work with daily, said they all are impressed. I have carried and managed projects on my own within this team. Literally do stuff a junior shouldnt be doing on his own but I manage to deliver time and time again. Both quality and quantity. Had my colleagues give me feedback and all of them having nothing negative to say.

However, my contract is expiring in ~2 months, and they told me they want to extend my contract, I told them I’d want to enter talks for new working conditions to better fit my role within the team. The manager said no and that its too soon to be discussing such things. So he wants to offer me the same conditions and doesnt even want to entertain the thought of asking me what I was thinking to receive as a raise.

When I told him other companies and other departments within the same company are offering a better salary for the same tasks I am fulfilling as a junior, and their vacancies are being listed on medior level, he told me I should feel free to apply for those jobs.

Is this normal? I feel like it isnt. How can you tell someone to go apply elsewhere if I want financial growth that reflects my performances and role within your team…? This rubbed me the wrong way.

If I have to do prep work before school that's fine and I'm expecting as much.But this is my problem: I can possibly get a year's worth of government funding to train up to a certificate in something while I stay on welfare (I'm in Canada). I can't do any more than that and I can't attend school while on welfare outside of doing this program, I'm expected to immediately get a job when I obtain the certificate. The govt. is looking for the most streamlined way to put people back to work.  I know people's entry points into computer science are varied and can range from years of schooling to self taught but I'm concerned that with no other background it will be very unlikely that I land anything decent with just a certificate. If you know of good quality, completely online CS Certificates in Canada please do let me know.

Also, I'm very interested in Project Management as an end goal.

There's a guy  named A that does some simple coding tasks (e.g., changing names or adding paddings on the frontend), he also acts like a sort of product manager. He's a senior to me.

Then there's this guy named B who is the CEO of the org and team lead of the backend in our team. To be fair, he's technically competent, however, he likes to be a reviewer of all the back-end PRs.

B is also super busy. I sent him a design doc almost a month ago and he still hasn't gotten back to me. You have to kinda beg him to attend the backend PRs. That's the main reason our backend features move very slowly.

The product we're working on is almost ready for onboarding clients but the backend is moving very slowly and there are a few tasks remaining due to that. We also don't have anything else to do, so the last few months have been super chill for me and my teammates.

I work on both front-end and back-end. Since there's not much to do, I look for bugs or technical debts and then ask for A's greenlight. From the very moment that I take something to do, A is always in my dm and like ""is it done?"", ""Did you create the PR?"", ""You said it would be done by last night but I can't see your PR"", ""John commented on your PR 2 hours ago, you haven't gotten back to him"" , ""ask B again to review your PR"", etc.
