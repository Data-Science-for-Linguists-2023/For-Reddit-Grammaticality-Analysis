Please go to [/r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/) if you are looking for crowdsourced legal advice (which we do not recommend).

1,1,20k Subscribers and Proposed New Rules,wml6ba,"Hi everyone,

**First,** I want to note that the sub has crossed the 20,000 subscriber mark. Given that there are several other legal communities on Reddit and I don't really promote this one, I am surprised we reached this benchmark. Thanks for being such a great and supportive community!

**Second,** I put up some polls last week about potential new rules. It seems like a strong majority of users would prefer a rule that prohibits non-lawyers from asking about current legal topics or issues. This is consistent with the original purpose of this sub (lol originalism) so I propose making a new rule: ""**Non-lawyers may not request that lawyers explain or weigh in on legal issues.**"" 
 
The obvious question is how will we enforce this rule. And the answer is ""not vigorously."" We do not want to stifle discussion and it's great if lawyers want to discuss legal issues amongst each other. What we are really trying to avoid is people sneaking in requests for legal advice or coming in with zero legal knowledge and asking the community to explain something rather than actually discussing/engaging. And if a non-lawyer pretends to be lawyer and engages in a productive way, we will have no way of knowing and no concerns.

**Third,** a much smaller majority of users favored a rule prohibiting people considering law school from asking for advice. As it stands, law students are welcome to engage, but we have been getting a lot more requests from high school students or individuals early in their college careers asking very basic questions about the profession. Given that this was a closer vote, I would propose a new rule: ""**All posts asking for career advice / perspective by non-lawyers or non-law students must be posted in the designated thread.**"" This would entail creating a standard, pinned post that we would direct non-lawyers / non-law students to while locking or deleting posts outside of that thread.

**Please let us know your thoughts and feedback on these proposed rules. And more generally, any thoughts on making the sub better.** I want to continue to foster to engaged, open community that we have, so your input really matters. Thanks!",Amicus_Conundrum,50,87,0.98
2,2,Advice for leaving litigation for transactional or regulatory work,11vpnx8,"After trying my best in several positions, I‚Äôm coming to the realization that litigation is not for me.

Plaintiff's counsel, if that matters.

Anyway, I have two cases with discovery outstanding. The first OC never asked for an extension just went MIA for a bit. When he reappeared (almost two weeks after discovery was due) he provided half of it and said he had some personal issues and he was very sorry. But he'd definitely get me the rest by the end of the following week (yesterday). I filed a stipulation to that effect. He even emailed me to tell me he might not get it in by COB, but would def get it on time. What do you know, he still hasn't sent it in.

Second OC: asked for 30 day extension on the eve of it being due. I said sure. Day after the extension deadline OC calls and says he'll get it in ""within a few weeks"" and I said he could have until the end of the following week to get it in (yesterday). Filed a stipulation. Still haven't received anything. We got our discovery in without asking for an extension. What gives with just...not following up? Not even a ""I'm sorry this is taking longer than I thought, please bear with me.""

My boss generally says not to follow up on a discovery deadline (at least the first one, or the extension deadline) immediately, to give it a few days as something of a professional courtesy.

11,12,"How do you think AI will change the practice of law, and have you started using it in your work?",11v6eej,"Hello fellow attorneys,

I'm a criminal lawyer specializing in legal drafting, Charter applications, and appellate briefs. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the legal profession and how it could change the way we work.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts and experiences on this topic:

1. How do you think AI will change the practice of law in the coming years? Will it lead to more efficient legal research, improved document drafting, or better case analysis? What about its potential impact on employment within the legal profession?
2. Have you already started using AI in your work, and if so, how has it helped you? Are there any specific AI tools or platforms you've found particularly useful? Conversely, have you encountered any challenges or limitations in using AI in your practice?
3. What are your concerns, if any, about the ethical implications of using AI in the legal profession? For instance, do you think AI could introduce bias or compromise client confidentiality?
4. Lastly, if you haven't started using AI yet, are you considering doing so in the future? What would be the main factors influencing your decision to adopt AI in your practice?

I'm looking forward to hearing your insights and learning from your experiences. As our profession evolves alongside technology, it's essential to stay informed and be prepared for the changes that may lie ahead.

Thank you in advance for your contributions to this discussion!",Half-W,5,2,0.62

I am looking for advice and reccomendation on what I should do or pursue.

13,14,What to do when your colleague is being mistreated?,11uifbu,"There are a lot of posts here about lawyers suffering from toxic bosses and outright abuse.  To all those who are suffering and haven't left their position yet, I hope you have people IRL to support you until you leave your situation.

So, what about the people who aren't mistreated/abused but have to witness their colleagues suffer? What do you do?

I'm in a situation where a partner acts in ways that is pretty clear they don't like my colleague.  It's not just making remarks or giving them too much work.  According to my colleague, the partner was dishonest to them about salary and has been holding back in providing certain ""fringe"" benefits to that particular associate.  These fringe benefits were provided to everyone else.  

My colleague has also told me how they always have to check their ""benefits"" (I'm being vague for a reason) because there always seems to be a problem with what's owed to them or there is a mistake in the record.  

For the record, my colleague's work is more than satisfactory and they do a good job.  So, ""performance"" is not an issue.  There just seems to be something about my colleague that this partner does not like. 

I know I will end up emailing another partner whom I know and trust.  Thinking about all this just made me wonder what other people do when they see a work friend suffer.

15,16,What is it about lawyering that makes us more stressed?,11txrq9,"This post is more for fun/a random thought I had.  I was thinking the other day about why lawyers statistically and anecdotally are up there in the stressful professions.  I am thankful to only work 45-50 hours most weeks, but maybe that‚Äôs part of the reason and I‚Äôm gaslighting myself.  Anyway, my thought was because a friend who is a mid level manager had meetings until 4 today and golf but I could sneak in 9 early afternoon if I wanted due to an open schedule.  So I thought, lots of business/industry professionals have to work at home, pull overtime, have angry internal/external customers, short timelines, rude bosses and staff, etc.

So I was trying to pinpoint why it‚Äôs such a uniquely stressful profession.  My quasi-conclusion was that, at least in litigation as I practice and for me, almost everything is adversarial.  Not only that, the comb they go through it with effects your client and you if something goes sideways.

I understand that for many of us 50 hour weeks would be a blessing.  So would most weekends without work and abrasive partners, both of which I‚Äôm fortunate to usually avoid.  I do still feel more stress than my former, fairly stressful if there was an arbitrary scale, profession, but couldn‚Äôt determine what makes me get butterflies, obsess over things, etc. how it seems that people in business or industry don‚Äôt or don‚Äôt vocalize/show the effects of as much.  Obviously Wall Street finance, big 4 accounting, etc. are a ton of work and challenging ‚Äî I‚Äôm not discounting the difficulty of anyone‚Äôs career ‚Äî but it still seems like lawyers get harsher mental health effects from the work.

So for me, I think the difference probably flows from the adversarial nature of litigation as something that is unique to the profession.  What do you think is *unique* to the profession that causes higher rates of depression, substance abuse, and so on?",NaZdrowie8,63,53,0.95
16,18,Question about starting a career as an attorney after being a cop.,11uiuhy," Hello,

So I, (M/33) recently got out of my career (cop for the last 9 years) and am looking at doing something else. When I was younger my backup plan if I couldn't get into law enforcement was always being a teacher. However, becoming an attorney has become a draw for me as well since I got into law enforcement.

It's not all about the money for me but more job satisfaction. Personally, I think I would be more personally satisfied as a teacher but being an attorney would be closer to what I already know and pay more which can give me other freedoms a teacher could not.

I am a single father with one 7 year old son and would be looking to find work in Washington State or North Idaho for context.

Currently I'm in my fourth year of practice in a defense litigation office for state government. I handle a mix of cases, mostly employment, personal injury, and civil rights. Because of understaffing, I am effectively a one-man law office, ie no supervision, doing my own filing and scheduling. I've tried a couple cases in state and federal court.
  
I used to have a few mentors I could go to for advice, but they've all quit/retired and haven't been replaced. Our turnover for 2022 was approaching 100%. I'm now the 2nd-most senior attorney at my location. Multiple ""generations"" of work friends have left, too. The turnover has at times led me to being assigned cases where no work has been done, sometimes a month before trial. Turnover has also led us to hire some absolute jokers who were embarrassing to be in the same courtroom with.
  
There was a time when I was very ambitious and genuinely loved the law. I tried out for the mock trial team in undergrad, and that basic form of trial practice clicked with me like nothing else ever had. I did well in law school. I've been told I have a really good instinct for litigation, and my motion practice and settlement track records support that. 
  
But the burnout has gotten to me, and it's starting to affect my quality of work. I usually get a bit burnt after trials, but it's like there's nothing even left to burn now. My brain is in survival mode. I've convinced myself I hate the entire profession, that I'm not suited for it. Maybe the pressure and unpredictability of litigation are too much. I've been trying to shake it for over 6 months. Therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and time off haven't helped. A job or career change seems like the only answer.
  
My gut instinct is that I just need to quit and take some time with nothing on the horizon to reset so that I know what I want. It seems like a catch-22: On the one hand, I don't think I will find the right job feeling how I do now--I'm not myself. On the other hand, four years of public service hasn't left me flush with cash (I'd survive, though), and quitting without something else lined up goes against the conventional wisdom (and there's nothing lawyers cling to more than convention). I suppose a middle path would be to find something part-time, but that seems more likely to be the worst of both worlds rather than the best. Or I could also just quit the profession entirely.

I previously worked as a public defender for the county and at a 100+ Attorney private insurance defense firm. I absolutely hate insurance defense (red car/blue car) work and don‚Äôt want to ever do that again, but I do like litigation and research. 


However, I‚Äôm getting so tired of the municipal court choosing not to follow the rules of evidence or making specific findings as to their rulings. The court is well aware that the office simply doesn‚Äôt have the resources to appeal/special action their clearly erroneous rulings, so it‚Äôs gotten worse and worse over my time here. 


I‚Äôve considered going to our appeals division because at least then I get to argue law in the cases where we determined it‚Äôs a case we have the manpower to take up, but that doesn‚Äôt address the fact that there will continue to be cases where we can‚Äôt appeal clearly erroneous decisions. Essentially, it‚Äôd be a move for myself rather than actually changing anything. 


It has reached a point where I am considering leaving altogether, but I don‚Äôt think I could without taking a pay cut. Even though it‚Äôs government work, I‚Äôm making what I think is a more than fair amount:

Other paid by city:
~10k yearly in a 401a 
~1.8k yearly in a post-employment health plan

Benefits:
Health/dental/vision are all nominal costs costs monthly for me as the city pays the majority and completing a wellness incentive further reduces the monthly cost

I‚Äôm afraid of not knowing what to say when they bring up a point that I didn‚Äôt think of. Any tips so that I don‚Äôt panic and stand there in silence would be greatly appreciated.


Edit: I read and followed all your comments and had the mock trial. My group and I ended up being victorious so I thank you all for your advice. 

The premise of the case was that a 5 year old was asked to steal candy by a 10 & 11 year old, the 5 year old kid said no, so the they think he needs to be punished. Later on the older kids see the 5 year old with his 8 year old brother and invite them to a ‚Äúclub house‚Äù which was actually an abandoned apartment complex. Getting to the 14th floor, the older kids were holding the 5 year old out the window and his brother managed to grab him and bring him back. The older kids tried a second time, this time threatening the 5 year old with a brick. Again the 8 year old grabs his brother but then one of the older kids bit into the 8 year old‚Äôs hand causing the 5 year old to plummet to his death. And the 2 older kids were arrested immediately.
It‚Äôs not all of the details but that is basically what the case was about.

At random, my team was assigned to be the defendant for the 2 older kids and to make sure they don‚Äôt get tried as adults.",OF3000,89,59,0.94

I will be quitting my current job soon because I've accepted a summer associate position with another firm. I have not yet given notice to my current employer. My summer position is contingent upon completing a conflict of interest form and having any conflicts ""cleared"" prior to my start date. 

My concern is filling out the conflict of interest form without the consent of my current employer. I don't feel comfortable listing the clients/opposing parties of matters I've worked on without speaking with my current employer first. However, ideally, I don't want to give my notice until any potential conflicts have been cleared by the new firm. So I feel I'm in a bit of a pickle. 

What is the standard practice for completing conflict of interest forms when moving to a new firm?

Is it okay to give my notice and then get the approval of my current firm to share client/opposing party names on the conflict of interest form? Or is it better to complete the form as best I can without involving my current employer, wait for all to be cleared, and then give my notice? 

Should I ask the new firm about this issue?  I don't want to come across as stupid...

For the tax season, I must work between 70-80 hours. Otherwise, I work 45-50 hours as my regular hours. My wife just graduated with her MSN ( Nurse practitioner), and her job is $125k annually. We paid off our students loan, car loans, and probably mortgage in the next 3-5 years with our current jobs. We live super comfortably in our lives.

Like, do you think if I hate being a paralegal I'd hate being a lawyer & vice-versa? Or would I at least be in close enough proximity to get a sense? I guess I'm also wondering if - all else being equal - it'd be better to try and get work at some cozy little office where I can as intimately involved with the whole picture as possible, and have lots of interaction with the attorneys, or if doing intake type of stuff might have some advantages I'm overlooking (not least of which, maybe steeling me against potential future drudgery?).

Anyway, a few interviews are going well, and I‚Äôve been forthright about my experience and emphasized the advantage of general experience coming from someone willing to train in the firm as though I were a new associate/junior.

Had an interview weds where I was offered on the spot verbally, but don‚Äôt have anything in writing.

However, I have a dark past of many hospitalizations, not because I was sick, but because I was too inexperienced and unskilled socially. I was alone. At first I dreaded the hospital. I wanted out as soon as I stepped into the facility. But I also couldn‚Äôt stand it at home, living with a psychologically and emotionally abusive family. So I went back to the hospital to socialize and meet new people. It was refreshing in a way. Then I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, which I do not have (Now they do not know what‚Äôs the diagnosis and am taking meds for adhd.) Then I gave up. Played video games all day. Didn‚Äôt do drugs or party, but stayed at home and literally gave up on life altogether. Long story short, I spent years of my life alternating between going to hospital on purpose to meet new people and get opportunities to build friendships, and giving up and pursuing worthless activities such as leisurely sports. 

My hospitalizations were hard on me, my self esteem, my sense of direction in life, motivation, so I was either caught up in a web of spinning my wheels getting nowhere, or I tried to create a quick fix by going back to hospital with the hopes of finding uplifting relationships that could inspire me once more. 

Now, I have no intention of going back to hospital. I still have no support and love from anyone in my life, but I am not letting that get in the way of what I want from life anymore. 

I have applied two weeks ago to begin an econ major at university of Ottawa and will also be minoring in finance if I am accepted. Problem is though that econ isn‚Äôt the best major for me, think. I do not know the mandate of the jobs i would get with that degree well, so I don‚Äôt know if I would like it. I also want to start my own business. 

I kind of see myself as a lawyer. I have thick skin and when I put my mind to something, nothing can stop me as I am a very determined person in nature. I like to be right, and I like to win.

Please help me figure out if it would be possible for me to pursue a career in law and land a good job after, despite my mental health record. Looking forward to your professional feedback. Thanks for reading.",NoTime7140,123,8,0.61
122,144,I posted this on LinkedIn Inspired By a Discussion Here So I thought I'd Share (Part 2 of 2),11lydyy," The Importance of Multidisciplinary Thinking As Attorneys  
   
Yesterday I gave some thoughts on the importance of niching down. Here are some additional thoughts on the corollary of being multidisciplinary in our thinking as attorneys as a way to lead to better decision making.  


It's important to develop a broad base of knowledge beyond our given niche AND to be able to integrate that knowledge within our practices in creative ways. ¬†While I'm admittedly a work in progress, I do try to work on this. Over the years, I've learned a few different litigation related areas including class actions, whistleblower and immigration. I'm always trying to figure out ways these practice areas interact with each other that are not obvious at first glance. Working at these odd intersections is not just fun, it also can produce some very creative solutions for clients. For instance, taking a deep experience of Delaware corporate law from my class action focused days and applying that framework to EB-5 investor disputes can produce some powerful strategies. Someone with only immigration or a securities litigation background likely wouldn't see the synergies. However, spending some time at the intersection of both allows for real creativity. There is magic at the intersections of seemingly disparate things and not much company there.  


I also try (with mixed success) to learn about disciplines outside of the law. There are some disciplines that have big ideas that port well into almost anything. For instance, understanding the role of incentives from the perspective of economics is useful everywhere where people are involved. Same idea for the concept of influence in psychology,evolution in biology or inverse function in algebra. All provide excellent mental models.¬†Things start to get really interesting when you are able to combine a bunch of these into your own way of thinking. This is where your decision making capability becomes unique.  


On the flip side, a narrow focus can limit one's ability to learn and grow over time. This can result in a stagnant approach to problem-solving and an inability to innovate. Having a narrow focus can lead to tunnel vision, which can prevent one from seeing the big picture or considering a range of possible outcomes. Additionally, having a narrow focus can limit one's ability to communicate effectively with others who have different areas of expertise. This can be particularly problematic in environments, where collaboration and the ability to integrate diverse perspectives are important.  


Ultimately, in my opinion, there is no set list of disciplines that attorneys should focus on to develop more utility. The key is to keep learning, applying and combining what you learn as you go. Over time, you will develop a unique mix of knowledge and mental models that allows you to see facets of a problem and solutions that other narrowly-focused ""experts"" may miss.",JoeGentileESQ,0,0,0.38
123,145,I posted this on LinkedIn Inspired By a Discussion Here So I thought I'd Share (Part 1of 2),11lycwl," I'm a fan of niching down.  


Immigration law is a vast field with many specialized niches. It's unlikely (impossible?) that any single lawyer will have deep knowledge across all of them, including myself. Therefore, when seeking an immigration lawyer, it's important to be specific about your needs rather than just looking for any lawyer who practices in this area.  


My law firm specializes in district court federal litigation related to immigration, such as cases involving delays, denials, and EB-5 fraud. Our experience allows us to practice at the intersection of immigration, class actions and whistleblower law. While I can discuss other immigration topics like extraordinary ability visas or Asylum to some extent, I don't have the nearly the same level of expertise as practitioners who focus on them every day and would never take a case representing a client filing a petition based either. In fact, I don't file any petitions (except some pro bono cases with appropriate hand holding).  


I often see problems arise when lawyers (even highly experienced ones) take on cases outside of their area of expertise. Since I'm a litigator, this is the context I see it most frequently. While templates and advice from listservs can be helpful, they cannot replace actual experience. When in doubt, it's best to cocounsel or simply refer it out. It's best for the client and best for the referring attorney if they plan on practicing long term.",JoeGentileESQ,0,0,0.43

I've been a good litigator and government attorney with a dumpster fire experience in private practice (on both my account and the employers), but it feels so liberating to truly accept I will be so much happier with a career change. I am super excited to apply for IBEW apprenticeships for wiremen and linemen.  Law is now my backup plan if I don't get accepted. Before a trade was my backup plan. I even got my father-in-law's advice about keeping my license active. He told me at that point, it is just for prestige and isn't worth the money to even try to do stuff on the side. He even said to resign from the state's bars I no longer live in. I have no shame in giving up law. I did at first, but yesterday something changed and I no longer do.

Over the past couple years in Alaska, I've been relying on myself to get shit done because its expensive to get stuff up here and labor is expensive. I'm building a shed from scratch, fixing my own cars, helping ham radio buddies run transmission lines and climbing on roofs to help them test and install antennas. Up here, I don't see any prestige loss either. I'll make more as a lineman, get a pension with a retirement age at 58, actually get paid for overtime, and better healthcare in a union. I'll make about the same as I do in government as a wireman (electrician) so my pocket book won't even take a hit.

133,159,Time to start my own firm?,11l1h7a,"Hi everyone, longtime lurker on a throwaway,

5 year call looking for advice on when to go solo. I was working for the government and non-profits. Finally, I decided join a firm in the private practice.

It has a unique compensation model. I keep 50% of the billings and need to pay a monthly administrative fee. When I started, the job posting clearly said you could work as much or as little. The idea was that the administrative fee would cover cost and the 50/50 split would be profits for the firm. He has recently doubled the administrative fee and now set minimum billings for each month.

This is not a typical firm where the partner delegates or gives you work. To the contrary, you are expected to make blogs, make content for youtube/tiktok, and contribute to business development, such as building out the website. In fact, I get delegated more non-legal work like reviewing legal services agreements and reading newsletters (unpaid). The only way to increase my billings is for me to make more content, contribute more to the business and hope that clients book with me instead of him, a colleague or another lawyer. He offers 30 minutes of advice/help every two weeks. Why am I not doing this for myself?

What's the point of sticking around?

After one year, I am starting to question the agreement and whether I should just open my own firm. I hustle for all my clients. I receive practically no work from the owner of this firm and I have 0 administrative support. The work that I receive is either (1) full of uncertainties and requires research or (2) at a discounted rate/not profitable like other files. I do everything myself, including sending out bills, consults and everything in between. I know that its a great deal with the 50/50 split, but I practically manage my own firm and get my own clients.

Yes, there is additional work to manage finances for the firm and trust account. BUT, I could roughly work 50% less and make the same amount of money, or work the same and double my salary... Every blog that I make, every video that I make, it goes towards building his firm. First, its unpaid. Second, I will need to redo this work when I eventually leave.

I really do not see any value for me to stick around. Yes, my name is on the website and yes, when he makes content, he endorses me. However, I can start making my own content. I can hire a senior counsel to meet with me occasionally and provide me with assistance when needed. I am willing to spend a few more hours each month to manage trust accounts and do a little more administrative work.

The value that he has is the name. He has been making content and videos for a while, and he receives lots of clients. People go to his website and then see my name and book with me. While I might have a slow start, what he did over the last few years is not rocket science. I have enough funds that I could not work for a few years without any trouble.

140,166,First year attorney‚Ä¶do firms usually mentor at all?,11kkrsj,"
I passed the bar in Oct and started at a firm that I clerked at during law school.  I feel like I get assignments with very little direction, and when I ask questions, I can tell I annoy my boss.  At the same time, we work in a practice area and geographic location where the county courts and judges operate by their own rules (most of which are not even published or contradict actual published rules).  So, I feel like I oftentimes have to ask how to do things because it‚Äôs not posted anywhere and I haven‚Äôt done it before.  Luckily, I‚Äôve had an associate that has kinda taken me under her wing, given me great advice, and even goes out of her way to explain things to me when she can tell that someone asks me to do something for which the county has a unique procedure and that procedure isn‚Äôt really published.  Other than that, I feel like I‚Äôm offered zero guidance on anything.

Also, I keep getting assigned onto cases that I haven‚Äôt worked on before, and when I ask my boss details about the case (I will have already have read through everything in the file), I can also tell she gets annoyed.   For example, my boss asked me to file responses to some motions in cases I hadn‚Äôt worked on.  After looking through the file, I had some questions on the facts of the case that were relevant to the response (the info wasn‚Äôt in the file/prior pleadings), and my boss definitely seemed irritated that I sent an email asking about the facts of the case.  

I guess I‚Äôm wondering, is this normal?  Or do firms usually mentor/train more?  Even though I clerked at this firm, I was not doing any of the work I do now.  I really liked the firm when I clerked there, but now I think everyone just assumes that since I passed the bar, I am at the same level as the attorneys who have been practicing there for 10+ years.

Signed ACRIS (a copy?)

I requested a Contin from the Lien Search company and will forward that to all parties on the day of closing.

157,183,Engineer Considering Law,11jvjz5,"I'm currently a Semiconductor Engineer about 2 years out of school and thinking about preparing for/applying to law school.

My engineering job is just boring the hell out of me and I'm wondering if Law would be more exciting. Unfortunately, as an undergrad I wasn't thinking about law school as an option so I'm poorly prepared for it (no relevant club or extracurricular experience like mock trial). Additionally, I have a 3.0 Electrical Engineering GPA from a fairly prestigious private university (think Northeastern or Tufts). That's low for a T14.

I'm considering Law vs MBA or MS because taking on cases, whether it's protecting the environment, making sure health care works or ""flashier"" types of law like criminal or corporate sounds kind of exciting. At least, more exciting than staring at a screen all day and feeling like what I'm doing doesn't mean shit. I literally feel like I'm wasting my life. I don't have the expertise to do something cool like help build a new product and most engineering these days is just writing software.

My questions (for context I live in California):

1. One thing that's holding me back is Salary. Right now as an engineer I'm making $135k a year. How long would it take me to work up to that salary in a Law career? (I assume I'd have to start as a paralegal, then an associate and so on)
2. What does the daily work look like? Is it alot of typing up/filling out documents? What are you actually doing most of the day?

175,203,Can my career recover or am I screwed lol,11hgmuy,"TL;DR: Entry level attorney, worked for VA for 2 years, quit because I absolutely hated it and it was taking a severe toll on my mental health, have been out of work for 4 months (intentionally for the first two months, latter two because I can't find a position) and don't know how to market my time at the VA in a way that would make it applicable to other fields given how super niche veteran's law is. Feeling like my only option is to go back into vet law or something that I would be equally unhappy doing. Advice? üò≠

Right out of law school, I got a job working at the VA doing compensation appeals. Did that for 2 years, it was exactly as awful as everyone says it is lol. I quit in October and went on a bit of a sabbatical because I was having full-on mental breakdowns so often to the point that my psychiatrist more or less demanded I quit (mix of the stress of the job plus some really traumatic family shit going on that I somehow got put in the middle of). 

It's now March, and I know I desperately need to get back into work, but I don't know how to even market myself because VA law is so niche and inapplicable to other fields. I have NO interest in going back into vet law but I don't know what else I can reasonably do. I was very actively applying in November and December, never got calls back, and kinda lost steam at the start of this year because I was feeling so discouraged. Admittedly, though, I have been avoiding applying to doc review and stuff like that because it doesn't seem interesting to me and I don't want to end up back in a job that I hate, but.... is it time to throw in the towel?

For reference, I have a soft health background (biopsych major, neuroscience minor), got a health certificate with my JD, with the writing component focused on medical device regulations for hygiene products. I ended up at the VA because they really sold it as a health/medical proximate position while I was interviewing... how foolish I was lmao. In an ideal world I would want to do something in the cosmetics industry -- science, product regulation, and my personal interest in the field -- but I know that's a long-term goal that I probably can't posture myself for right now given my circumstances... although if anyone has any ideas, I'm all ears lmao.",TeamEmotional3933,16,10,1.0

Graduated with $30,000 undergrad debt from a ‚Äúmost competitive‚Äù 4-year university. I deferred payment while in law school at a top-75 law school 2005-2008. Paid off undergrad debt only last year.

Graduated with $160,000 from law school in 2008. Initially had a partial scholarship but lost it. First year grades didn‚Äôt go as planned, and I quickly realized I wouldn‚Äôt be making $160-$180,000 out the gate.

After graduation from law school, at one point my combined education debt was over $200,000 due to deferred payments and IBR while struggling to find good work in market downturn of 2008. Best job I could find paid $72,000 after taking temp work from 2008-2009. 

Made $72k from 2009-2013; took new job and made $80k 2013-14; took new job paying $120k in 2014 and over 6 years received regular raises and promotions through 2020 making $188k. 

I was released from my position in 2020 due to pandemic effect on my practice area. I found work within a month at a much smaller firm paying $170k. I stayed for one year before taking a new position paying $220k. I moved once more last year and now am on salary earning $240k.

If not for the debt eating at times $3000/month of my net earnings, I feel like I‚Äôd have systematized savings and investments by now. But I got married 8 years ago, and having 7yo twins and a surprise baby last year, plus a home purchase with a $480k initial mortgage immediately prior to the pandemic, I‚Äôve never been in position to maximize a 401k contribution, or had a great match incentive from any job since starting my career. 

I have about $60,000 in my 401k total, and about $175k equity in my house due to rise in property values since I bought. I pay almost $3k/month combined for mortgage/tax/insurance, $2k/month for law school debt (5 more years until payoff!). I don‚Äôt own extravagant cars. Had to do some renos to the house since moving in.

Anyways, I just got my 2022 end of year review. There were many positive and favorable reviews, and a few general comments regarding areas for improvement. Which is fair. I want to improve and I welcome constructive criticism.

But what I am not okay with is being totally blind sided with negative feedback and lies.

Let me explain.

There was one extremely detailed negative review and I know exactly who the reviewer is bc the review references specific assignments and events. For the record, the reviewer was a senior associate who was just promoted to jr partner. The thing that really sucks is, of everyone at the firm, this is the only attorney who I felt like our work relationship had, or could have, developed into a mentorship/friendship. She‚Äôs the only other mom in the entire practice group and I really looked at her as an unofficial mentor figure. I thought our relationship was strong enough that she could have raised any or all of the issues below with me directly. Of course, she wasn‚Äôt obligated to do so. But throwing me under the bus in my written evaluation with exaggerated and false claims, without even making a single effort to talk to me directly‚Ä¶. I‚Äôll just say I feel extremely blindsided and would personally would never do that to anyone.

Her paragraph basically dragged me in every way.

First, I she said i am non-responsive to her emails and always had some excuse for missing deadlines. This is untrue. I went through the past 6 months of correspondence with her, and on some occasions I was turning around 5-10 page research papers in a matter of 2-3 days to meet her arbitrary deadlines. I say arbitrary because she didn‚Äôt even review the work until a few weeks later. Some things do take longer to turn around but to say I ‚Äúmiss deadlines‚Äù an ‚Äúdo not respond‚Äù to her emails is just false. There are countless (literally I lost count) emails I sent her of research, questions, assignments, updates, that she still, to this day, has never even acknowledged. Some are months old, which makes me question if she‚Äôs even seen them.

On top of that, for the past 6 months I‚Äôve been stopping by her office at least 3-4x a month to discuss my work - whether it be assignment updates, to get her perspective on an legal question, or to plan for upcoming deadlines. I started doing this because my last performance review encouraged me to seek out more in person collaboration and interaction. And during my mid year performance meeting (which is a standard meeting) the managing partner told me he thought she would be a great ‚Äúmentor‚Äù type figure for me and encouraged me to build that relationship.

Her extremely detailed review gave 2 specific ‚Äúexamples‚Äù of my ‚Äúpoor performance.‚Äù First, she criticized me for missing a previously scheduled phone call meeting with a client. That's a long story, and I edited my post to remove it because that's not the main concern .  My frustration with that is that she presented it as optional, and  when I didn't attend, acted like it was no problem at all.  But then put it in my performance evaluation as a serious problem. However, I will chalk that up to poor communication - I thought it was optional, apparently it was not- and I will take the blame for that. 

However, the second ‚Äúexample‚Äù  is my main concern. In the review, she claimed that I filed an argument that was ‚Äúriddled with typos and flawed arguments‚Äù because I neglected to incorporate her mandatory redline revisions before filing it. ‚ÄúRiddled with typos and flawed arguments‚Äù because I did not make the revisions she told me to, which, she wrote, were ‚Äúnot mere suggestions‚Äù.

This is blatantly false. I went into the filing system, pulled the filed document and electronically compared it to the redline document she sent me.  EVERY SINGLE ONE of her revisions was made and included in the filed document. The ONLY thing different is that I moved the placement of a table to be under a heading she had made for it, but had left blank underneath. Outside of this non substantive formatting change, her revised document and the filed document are identical. There are no typos. There are no ‚Äúflawed legal arguments‚Äù.

The fact she put the blame on me is even more infuriating because I sent her my draft almost 4 weeks before the filing deadline‚Ä¶. 26 days to be exact. She did not send me her revisions until 2 days before the deadline. They were significant. I made all the revisions over the next 2 days (one being a Saturday) and I sent her a copy of the final version for her to review one last time, if she wanted, before I filed. She never responded. I filed the document late that evening in order to meet the deadline.

This false narrative is especially concerning because we ultimately lost the argument‚Ä¶ and it seems like she is essentially saying I committed malpractice.

My overall frustration stems as well from the fact that, to my face, she has done nothing but praise my work. Even today, she responded to research that I sent to her (15 days ago) and started it off by saying how ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù it was and what a ""great job"" I did. If she had ever expressed any of these concerns to me, these ‚Äúissues‚Äù could have been addressed, clarified and corrected months ago. Instead, she waited for this moment to reveal to my employer and me how disappointing I allegedly am, in a written form which will stay in my work file forever.

So‚Ä¶ what now? Clearly I‚Äôm dreading my end of the year meeting (also standard). I‚Äôm worried about being fired‚Ä¶ although my overall summary noted my positive reviews and said they were confident I could improve any weaknesses by my next evaluation. I am not the type to push back on these types of things. I‚Äôm not a combative person, I‚Äôm pretty passive, and don‚Äôt want to come across as defensive. At the same time, I‚Äôm afraid that, if I don‚Äôt speak up, it will be assumed that I agree with what she said. Not to mention, one of general areas for improvement is that I need to be more ‚Äúassertive‚Äù

Again‚Ä¶ everyone is entitled to their own opinion and has their own perception, but her failure to raise any issue with me when we have been meeting in person for months now, in addition to  her objectively false statements  about the filed document, makes me wonder if I need to rebut her portion of my review in writing.

207,246,Feeling Stuck and Unsure What to Do,11fg8fe,"
I‚Äôm a fairly new attorney, I really am not enjoying where I work or the area of law I‚Äôm in and would like to apply to a different job that I think I would enjoy. I‚Äôve been here less than a year.

For context, I work in criminal law as a public defender. At first I thought I‚Äôd love this job, I had internships and enjoy being in court. Now I find all I am is critically depressed. I see how people could be fulfilled by this job, but it just makes me sad.  I feel damned if I do, damned if I don‚Äôt. Health issues that I had managed in law school are starting to ramp up again due to stress. People are telling me to cut certain corners, but morally I don‚Äôt believe in that, so I‚Äôm at work late all the time trying to do everything I can (not to humble brag or anything, I just fear my own respect for myself will go down if I don‚Äôt do everything in my power to help) I care too much and work is all I can think about. I think staying in this area of law will kill me. 

Furthermore, I love my boss, but he‚Äôs inherited a sinking ship. He‚Äôs trying to do right by me, he really does look out for me because I‚Äôm new, and checks in frequently. However there‚Äôs only so much he can do. Turnover here has been crazy lately, reassignments have been constant. The judges are getting really annoyed with us because we‚Äôre unstable. I feel like I haven‚Äôt been able to be properly mentored, because everything is so crazy busy no one has the time. When I am mentored, it‚Äôs an attorney who is lackadaisical about what we do who has the most time to talk to me, and he half the time is straight up wrong. 

Morale is low among attorneys and paralegals and coverage for courts is extremely unstable. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of many of my coworkers. A couple are great but they work part time as consults and when they are here they‚Äôre so overloaded with work because they‚Äôre a) friendly and b) very competent, so they‚Äôre tasked with a lot. The others are bitter for no reason and when given an inch they take a mile. Other senior attorneys have left. I‚Äôve been dumped more extremely complex cases recently because they‚Äôre unavailable, and then they don‚Äôt have time to answer questions. 

I could handle all of this for at least a year, except recently the workplace has gone from cold to toxic. 

When me and a coworker were supposed to hold down the ship while everyone else was gone, my coworker, we‚Äôll call her ‚Äúx‚Äù, dipped out and left me alone. Cue paralegals coming to me left and right with crazy issues I often wasn‚Äôt sure how to handle. Good experience, sure, but there was one very sensitive situation I knew I couldn‚Äôt just figure out. I didn‚Äôt want to rat my coworker out, but she wasn‚Äôt answering her cell, so I had to call another coworker (good guy, he was taking care of his sick dog but had offered me his phone in case of emergencies) what was going on. When he asked why I was handling it alone, I explained that X had left. 

This is not the first time X has left when she was supposed to be one of the last attorneys in the office, but no one had reported previously. But when I told my good coworker, he did tell my boss and X got reprimanded.  

Cue X now being very cold to me in the office from hereon out and not welcome to questions. 

Then a few days ago, I was going over a case that I inherited with a coworker, we‚Äôll call them Y. I‚Äôm handling this case for Y because they‚Äôre going on leave, but it was their case. When I offered a concern I had about the facts of the case, they asked ‚Äúare you (cue: derogatory slur)‚Äù. 

I had no idea what to say to them. They seemed to realize what they‚Äôd said, blinked at me, but didn‚Äôt apologize. I‚Äôve been seeing red ever since. 

My boss‚Äôs hands are tied. We need people. He can‚Äôt afford to fire anyone right now. And no one seems to go to HR here so I haven‚Äôt. Just talking about this makes me want to cry again, I‚Äôve never been so emotional in my life. 

I want to leave. I want to leave so bad. It‚Äôd be one thing if I loved the work, but I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôd be another thing if I loved the people, but I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm burnt out and stressed out and I dread going to work every day which makes me more sad. I love being a lawyer actually. But I didn‚Äôt go to school for this long to hate my work. It‚Äôs even worse that I look at the prosecutor‚Äôs office, they all seem to really like each other and have a good environment. I feel like that‚Äôs what I had in my internships too. This has just been miserable. 

There‚Äôs a few jobs I‚Äôve been looking at that look nifty that I‚Äôd like to apply to. But all my coworkers keep telling me about is how small our legal community is and how a bad reputation lingers. I don‚Äôt want to get a bad rep for leaving after six months. But I think if I try to stay for a year, I‚Äôm going to be a wreck for the rest of my life.

Job One: national non-profit. Personally meaningful work with sympathetic clients at the appellate level. Pays a paltry amount with no negotiations (60k).  Team of ~6-10 attorneys.  Excellent job growth and professional development opportunities. I have indirect experience with this speciality but work experience prior to law school that helps, so I would need more training. Type of work is more directly applicable to private firms or government work for future job prospects.

Job Two: local non-profit. Personally meaningful work with sometimes less sympathetic clients that are likely screened out before I invest significant time. Pay is lightyears better (80k with negotiation potential to 100k).  Team of 2 attorneys for now (entire org is about 10 people, lawyers and staff). Less job growth internal to organization but has significant connections to other players in the niche field. Unclear on professional development opportunities but org appears to have a great, forward thinking team making huge strides in their specialties. I have direct experience in this area of law and prior work experience before law school that lends itself to type of work.  Probably most niche of this already niche area of law between the two.

I am leaning towards the second job given the pay. I have a new baby and some debts I want to pay down. I‚Äôm in a HCOL area but could make ends meet with lower paying job while paying down debt, albeit more slowly.

220,262,"Are law school professors not always fully invested in their students‚Äô learning, due to misalignment of goals?",11ezuaf,"I notice that my law school professors (and maybe Teachers in general) are not always fully invested with helping students excel. For example, I realize that some of the professors have not been providing the sources for their teaching material, or have been providing the less direct sources, indirectly misleading students. It is almost like gatekeeping knowledge. Once you discover the real source of their teaching material, you realize that you can learn so much faster because all the explanations are on there.

I‚Äôm guessing the reasons for it is that some professors want to appear smarter than their students, and are afraid that students become more knowledgeable than them in class, or ask the difficult questions? They want control over their classes and gain favour by demonstrating academic superiority. Some even intentionally make their classes challenging, by going beyond the reading list, etc? I‚Äôm not sure how many professors will admit this, or if there is some underlying rationale which they themselves might not realize.

Another obvious reason which I can think of, is that marking papers is a chore, and professors want to make it easy to differentiate between the average and excellent student. Hence, they provide only the most basic knowledge to students, while those students at the top may have access to further know-how‚Äôs due to family connections, private tutors, etc. 

professors are perfectly content with allowing the average student to stay average because it makes their job easier as long as you don‚Äôt fail. I‚Äôve also noticed that some professors tell us ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay to be average‚Äù, etc, because it essentially serves them well. It doesn‚Äôt do professors good for students to be ambitious, demand a lot in consultations, etc, and make it difficult to grade papers. Professors get graded by students in my school so keeping student expectations low serves them well?

Hence, I believe that professors are often good at providing the most basic knowledge, but beyond that, it requires a lot of student initiative to break those barriers especially if one does not have connections and resources?

Of course, there are great professors around but as a student who used to hold my Teachers and professors with the highest respect, this realisation has come to be quite a shocker.

The fact that he is also an old money, multi millionaire embezeler living on a 1700 acre estate might actually do him more harm than good.  Are people in this area so terrified of this family that they would acquit?

The amount of oxy that he asserts he took on a daily basis appears ridiculous (60*30mg). He appears not to know about the higher dosages which would mean fewer pills for the same total amount ingested. Is 30mg the only dose that is sold on the street?

I went solo shortly after passing the bar and I am now a second year attorney. I worked at 2 plaintiff side employment firms beforehand, all through 3L and until I went solo (about 7 months). My first year was a whirlwind, I tried many different practice areas, and I was making enough to survive, but I couldn't thrive. After analysis of my business, and the realization that doing door law is just asking for malpractice, and a few clients that couldn't pay their bills, I decided to go back to labor and employment law, the practice area that I know best. 

However, these are all contingency cases, and I'm having trouble with cash flow until reaching settlement. Also, defense firms can look me up and they know that I'm new and small and that they can starve me out and get me to settle for a lower value. So far I've held out but I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to. I've picked up contract and appearance work to help me weather the storm, but it is inconsistent. I'm wondering how other solos got through this issue when starting out. I'm a true solo and I keep a pretty lean shop, but still these months have been rough.

233,278,First year lawyer - didn‚Äôt hit billable hour targets recently,11e07jw,"Sorry for the long post ahead!
I‚Äôm a first year lawyer at a boutique firm. I have monthly $$ amount targets of billables to hit rather than a number of hours. For January and February, my targets are lower than usual to account for the Christmas break (our firm closes from Christmas Eve to mid Jan) and the generally quieter period. 

My boss has just raised the fact that I‚Äôm below my (already low) targets for Jan and Feb‚Ä¶ My issue is I feel like my billables are low because I didn‚Äôt have enough work to do, ie he didn‚Äôt give me enough work to do. 

He is in charge of allocating work to everyone and he only came back from his extended Christmas leave in early February. He available by email but he was still very much out of office. Meaning any work I needed his approval on or any request for more work had to wait until he could eventually get to it. 

I would try to find more work but there simply wasn‚Äôt much for me to do, and in late January my boss even told me ‚Äòif you run out of work, watch some legal webinars and read some case law.‚Äô So that‚Äôs what I ended up doing. He also said ‚Äòtake advantage of this quiet time, things will get busy again.‚Äô 

It‚Äôs annoying that my low billables are being pointed out to me, when I feel like Jan/Feb were out of my control. I‚Äôve worked at law firms for 5+ years but this is the first firm that has billable hours so I don‚Äôt know if this is normal.

234,280,Should I start small and work my way up or go big immediately?,11dyew6,"Hi all, I'm a fresh graduate of Bar School. 

I am currently doing a paralegal job in a small law firm and have the option to convert it to a 1-2 year permanent contract. My boss is a great mentor - he's supportive, gives good feedback and treats his staff well. The working hours are manageable, I'm home at 8pm and am not harassed on weekends. It sounds great but there's a nagging thought at the back of my head I'm 'taking the easy way out.' In particular, I'm questioning if my decision not to apply to bigger corporate-commercial law firms is a bad one. 

Some context: between 2019-2021, I suffered terrible depression. I started balding, getting bad headaches and couldn't get out of bed at all and almost dropped out of Bar School (but I didn't and pushed on and finished it!). After 2 years of therapy, meds and lifestyle changes I am much better. I am not the same person as I was before - competitive, jealous of my peers and constantly stressed. I like the new me a lot more. However, I also want to earn a decent living and of course, learn more about the law because I do find it fascinating. I do want to work in a big law firm one day because some of the deals they do can be really exciting. 

So that brings me to the question - should I accept this offer at this small firm where my mental health is protected, get some experience and learn from my great boss for a while and then try for bigger firms? Or should I shoot immediately for the bigger ones and start big and go up from there as they say? The bigger firms of course have much better pay and exposure - I'll be exposed to complex M&A transactions, IPOs, capital market stuff etc whereas in this firm it's smaller M&A deals and conveyancing. I went to a relatively good university (the London School of Economics) and have decent extracurriculars and grades (I was a perfectionist Type-A workaholic in uni which is what made me so depressed) so I think I have a good shot of getting into these bigger firms, but as I said - there tends to be a culture of overworking juniors in these firms and poor work life balance. And nowadays there's a culture in these bigger firms of ""home grown partners"" - they're reluctant to hire people from the outside and would rather recruit people straight from university and mold them into partners. 

Anyway, I'm really sorry for this essay but I'd appreciate any insights from people who have worked in smaller firms and in biglaw. In short, I value my mental health, friendships and hobbies and would like to start small and build my way up into a bigger law firm slow and steady, but there is a fear that if I don't join a big firm and get grinding immediately, I'll be left behind in terms of exposure and experience because law is a competitive field and when I try to join a bigger firm down the road I'll be beaten out by more talented people.",MirrorBane,4,1,1.0

QUESTION: What is the law regarding sidewalk defects in New York City, where the federal government leases the adjoining property?

ANSWER: In New York City, property owners have a legal obligation to maintain their sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition. This includes ensuring that the sidewalk is free from any defects or hazards that may cause harm to pedestrians.

However, when the federal government leases property adjoining the sidewalk, the legal responsibility for maintaining the sidewalk may be unclear. Generally, when the federal government leases property, it is immune from state and local laws, including those related to sidewalk maintenance.

In New York City, the law regarding sidewalk defects on property leased by the federal government is somewhat complicated. In some cases, the federal government may be responsible for maintaining the sidewalk if it has assumed responsibility for doing so under the terms of the lease agreement. In other cases, the responsibility for maintaining the sidewalk may fall to the property owner or the City of New York.

If you have been injured on a sidewalk adjoining property leased by the federal government, it is important to seek the advice of an experienced attorney who can evaluate your case and help you understand your legal rights and options.

270,326,Family law attorney claims there is blatant discrimination against men,11az0k2,"Taking this from a comment I read from a Family Law Attorney in Canada. Won't mention who.

>I am at the point where, when I am doing support calculations, I include gender as a factor in calculating quantum. Basically, I assume that a the trier of fact will unconstitutionally discriminate against the male support recipient. I do so because this allows me to more accurately predict outcomes.  
>  
>Ditto for any kind of criminal sentencing (only do crime related to domestic stuff). I have had to explain to people that they will likely be sentenced more/less strenuously because of their gender. Again, assuming unconstitutional discrimination has predictive power.  
>  
>Case law for required disclosure/notice for support variation up/down? Different tests - test for adjusting support up is extremely lax, and the test for adjusting support down is strict. Prejudice for delay? Same deal.  
>  
>Liability for paternity fraud? Civil liability should work at common law - instead, the Courts create a special exception to avoid liability for women. No real legal justification for this (basically, ""we don't want to deprive children of funds"") that would fly in any other area of civil litigation (try arguing that you shouldn't be liable for securities fraud because a finding would deprive your children of funds).  
>  
>Civil liability in general? Until recently, was heavily restrictive to avoid liability for various forms of fraud, defamation, and dishonesty. Courts opened this up recently (last 2-3 years) specifically to remove barriers to allow women to sue civilly for domestic abuse (IMO, a positive development). We'll see how this develops - my guess is the Court keeps protections around things like fraudulent reporting and defamation.  
>  
>I know a judge in my jurisdiction who is infamous for ""ruling for the woman"" pretty much no matter what. Just ask pretty much any duty counsel practicing in the area and they know who it is. Never heard anything remotely similar the other way round.  
>  
>Family Law is so blatantly unfair on so many levels, it's hard to wrap your head around just how unfair it is without practicing in the area. \[...\]  
>  
>One thing I've learned is that, if the family law system can develop a way to screw men, it will find that way. The system (not necessarily individual judges, but the system as a whole) is grossly sexist, and Family Law is full of post-hoc rationalizations and exceptions designed to ensure that men don't get justice.

Tack on life‚Äôs other obstacles ‚Äî finances, relationships, etc. ‚Äî and it‚Äôs hard to see the light. I suspect one of the most common catalysts for suicidal thoughts is how one is treated by other lawyers, whether at one‚Äôs firm or adversaries. We often don‚Äôt treat each other like human beings. But we are! We must start acting accordingly or others may die.

To my fellow racial and ethnic minorities, I understand it‚Äôs hard when we take orders from those who don‚Äôt look like us nor appreciate the barriers we had to overcome to become attorneys. While ‚Äúdiversity and inclusion initiatives‚Äù are popular now, it‚Äôs clear that many firms don‚Äôt understand that it‚Äôs not parallel to elitism. If the efforts are genuine, the refusal to consider candidates from non-elitist schools hinders these initiatives. It is likewise hurt by refusing to consider candidates from non-elitist schools who were not blessed with ability to immediately succeed in their first year of law school, posting ‚Äúonly‚Äù Bs and B+s. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you scored all As the next two years, the impact of those first year grades limit how high your average can become.¬†

And even if we come from an elitist school, which is unlikely unless your family was fortunate enough to have you in good grade schools and able pay for tutors when necessary (of course, there are exceptions to this notion), we often hear the whispers ‚Äúoh, they aren‚Äôt that smart, their degree is due to affirmative action.‚Äù A few months ago, my friend, she‚Äôs black, was told that the firm already decided she would not make partner next year. Indeed, one year in advance, they told her there was nothing she can work on to be promoted. The reason ‚Äî a white female associate, with whom she graduated law school, had previously lied about her efforts on a project, essentially called her lazy. Before asking her side of the story, she was scolded and her story fell on deaf ears. In other words, she was coined the ‚Äúlazy black woman.‚Äù Of course, one year prior to when decisions are made, the white female associate was told she‚Äôs being promoted.

While I already knew the answer, I asked her if she would speak with HR. She responded ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm just happy to have a job and don‚Äôt want that to effect me.‚Äù If the roles were reversed, the white associate probably would have had a temper tantrum and perhaps cursed out a partner, without punishment.

I know certain backgrounds speak ill of psychotherapy but please give it chance. No one needs to know unless you tell them. Also, don‚Äôt be afraid to take medical leave for mental health, for which you‚Äôre protected from retaliation. I candidly believe that, eventually, things will drastically change for us.

296,356,Has anyone ever felt guilt after a win in court?,118h2vb,"I know, this sounds silly. I'm a first year family law associate at a small firm, so this could be my naivete talking here. I just litigated (and won) my first case. It was a contested relocation, and I came in late on the case to represent mom, who wanted to move. When I took her on as a client she sounded like the perfect victim so I was a bulldog against her ex. But as the case progressed, I realized she was the problem. The ex was actually reasonable, overly accommodating, made good faith efforts to communicate, and even overpaid in child support to make sure she and the kids were okay.  He's actually the type of client I'd be proud to represent in court; his focus seemed to truly be on the kids and wanting them close.

My client was impossible. She refused to compromise, was skeptical of clear good faith negotiations, and routinely ignored her ex's earnest attempts to communicate. Her reasons for wanting to relocate seemed legit on its face, but as I talked to OC and read up on motions that were filed way before the relocation was thrown in the mix, the timing of it all made me skeptical. I still fought like a dog til the end. During trial, the ex's case was entirely about his relationship with the kids. Never badmouthed my client once. His testimony confirmed my suspicions that she was the problem who routinely interfered with his parenting time. My client insisted on creating her own exhibits and they were all about how superior she was compared to her ex. I felt foolish arguing some of the points she insisted I argue. This was truly a case of ""hating your ex more than you love your kids"". 

We won and my client moved. Next was the child support matter. My client remained unreasonable in settlement negotiations. The father even offered to waive an 8k credit he was owed, and my client still fought him on tiny details. I reminded her that he'd have every right to revoke his offer, especially considering high emotions following the judge's ruling. I advised her not to take it to court, and she eventually settled. 

She's since ghosted me and ignored my attempts to collect attorney fees. I can't shake the feeling that I was played. I helped my client knock this poor man around. Other attorneys at my firm told me I'm too emotionally invested and that as Family Law attorneys, we represent our client, not the children. A win is a win and I should celebrate winning my first case and getting my client her desired outcome.

I have experience working as a corporate law clerk and was thinking of making some money by finding people who need someone to prepare their corporate minute books. Most people, when they incorproate a company, they just receive the articles of incorporation and don't even know what a minute book is.

Where can I advertise this type of service for the best results? Is there a platform where I can post an ad that I can provide services as a corporate law clerk, for example, where a potential client may find and hire me to prepare the minute book for their company?

308,368,Defense attorneys - why do you dismiss certain jurors?,118be9x,"I am curious:

I had jury duty last week, and I was dismissed during voir dire by the defendant‚Äôs attorney.  I‚Äôm so curious why this happened and what the psychology might‚Äôve been behind it. It was a drunk driving incident or some OVI case and I haven‚Äôt been on either side of the law in my whole life and I was asked about that -> so I would think I can be considered an unbiased juror.

I‚Äôm surprised the defense dismissed me out of all people. There were other jurors who had traffic accidents in their family & friend circle that were caused by drunk driving, etc. Why not those? Did I look too much like a Karen?
The defendant was a female, and a mother (like me), so was her attorney, the prosecutor was a male, and he dismissed some other female juror as well. Did I do something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or did I look wrong?? I think it was personal, because I saw them whispering about me almost the entire time. So interesting! Defendant‚Äôs atty hardly asked me any questions at all.

After many ups and downs of law school I found myself in a relationship with a married man. He is a partner at his law firm and while I never worked there, I am a law student. 

The relationship has since ended, but he continues to carry on essentially preying on people with less power than him. We live in a southern state where adultery is technically a crime, however isn‚Äôt usually charged and is rather just used as grounds for divorce without having to wait for the 1-year separation period. 

I am taking the July Bar Exam and a lot has happened recently where part of dealing with my guilt is coming clean and apologizing for my actions. I want to tell his wife, not only for my own healing, but in the hopes that she realizes she deserves more and can find her own true happiness with someone who actually respects and cares for her. 

My concern is that if I tell her, it could backfire and they/he would report it to the bar association out of spite. 

Can people report things to the bar association about you? Is this something that could potentially land me in a character and fitness hearing? Should I let karma take the wheel and save myself instead? Saving myself just feels selfish after what I‚Äôve already done.",haydnkay,12,0,0.29

Some background - I started off as an insurance defense associate. I disliked the work for obvious reasons (billable hours and demanding partners), but otherwise enjoyed aspects of the job. Less than a year into my first associate position, my wife and I moved to a different state for her job. I took a job in a niche field of risk management, where I work in-house at a big law firm and have worked on transferring my license. Again, I enjoy my work, but the pay is dismal. 

Now that I have my license I have been applying to jobs for a while, however I‚Äôve had no bites. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because of the school I went to (which was a really good regional option, but now that we live in a bigger city, it doesn‚Äôt stand up), or my short work history, or what. I‚Äôm also in a very saturated market with with a lot of Ivy Leagues. It could also just be me and my resume. 

Regardless, I finally received some interest from a Plaintiff‚Äôs firm. They are a big local firm. One of those Firm‚Äôs with the snazzy billboards and commercials. I had an interview and everything went well. 

The problem is, I‚Äôm not sure if I want to be a plaintiffs attorney for the rest of my career. I‚Äôm worried that accepting a position at this plaintiffs firm will peg hole me.

322,387,I tried a case over $112 last week,116mff6,"My client paid fees through the plaintiffs bank portal as suggested on plaintiffs bill.  We have a note where he called the day before his payment to fix his login, the portal shows the payment and the status as ‚Äúrefunded,‚Äù and my clients bank statement shows where it came out (day of payment) of his account and then (for some reason nobody can explain) back into his account 6 days later. 

First notice he got the payment didn‚Äôt go through - an attorney letter 4 months later demanding ~ 4x the amount he paid for fees and costs. Now they want atty fees too of 7500. We offered the original amount numerous times throughout the litigation and got our offers into evidence. Plaintiff argued that since the portal is a third party company, they aren‚Äôt responsible. We argued that they are because they put ‚Äúpay your bill online at xyz.com.‚Äù

We countersued lol, let‚Äôs hope the equities prevail. Our position was the plaintiff had a duty to make sure it‚Äôs portal credited the payment.


UPDATE:
 
Ruling came out today. Court found that it was uncontested that my client owed the $112 and that the first notice he had was when he got the legal claim months later for 4x the amount. 

Court found that the plaintiff hired the mgmt company, and that while the mgmt company used a third party payment provider, the plaintiff managed, and advertised it as a method of payment. As such, even if plaintiff can‚Äôt be responsible for knowledge of the error, they were negligent in failing to keep the books and proper accounting. 

Court found for plaintiff on its claim for the $112 and my client for negligence, court denied everything else. 


Court ordered my client to pay $112

332,399,I have something I want to get off my chest.,1143128,"I have been practicing law for about 20 years. I used to be a firm lawyer, now I work someplace that doesn‚Äôt require billable hours. Some would consider it a prestigious job, and I‚Äôm surrounded by brilliant, hard-working attorneys. 

I, however, am not hard working. I slack off at work all. the. time. I mean browsing the internet, playing games on my phone, doing pretty much anything except working. There are days, or even weeks, when I literally do nothing at all, other than answering the occasional question or attending conference calls. Now, there are periods when I‚Äôm able to motivate and get something done. And I can rally for deadlines. But I am not putting in solid days ‚Äì I‚Äôm often present but not doing my work. 

I don‚Äôt act this way because I want to. I was recently formally diagnosed with ADHD, I‚Äôm on meds and seeing a therapist, but between that and some deeply ingrained bad habits, I just often don‚Äôt work. I want to be more disciplined, I‚Äôve tried to change for decades. By now I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I‚Äôm just accepting that this is who I am. 

But here‚Äôs the insane part.  Every year I have a performance evaluation, and my managers tell me I‚Äôm doing a great job! They give me bonuses. I‚Äôm actually pretty well regarded within my specialty. I‚Äôve had a few pretty high-profile accomplishments. I get invited to speak at conferences and people from other offices call me for my advice. I used to be afraid of getting caught slacking off, but a few years back it occurred to me that if I *did* get caught, I could say, ‚Äúthis is how I‚Äôve been operating since I got here. You‚Äôve been giving me positive evaluations for years. So I must be doing something right.‚Äù And at that point I stopped being afraid of getting caught. 

But that doesn‚Äôt stop me from feeling guilty. And at the end of a day where I‚Äôve done nothing I just feel like shit. I think of myself as a person with integrity, but obviously the way I‚Äôve acted is anything but honest. 

So, I‚Äôm thinking about quitting the profession entirely. I realize now that law was not a good profession for me to go into. My brain cannot handle sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours a day. I hate the feeling of sitting at my desk, playing on my phone while wishing I was doing my work. I wish that I could just consider myself lucky, like somehow I‚Äôve put one over on everyone and landed an easy, respectable, well paying job, that lets me play endless hours of games. But I just feel like an asshole. 

Anyway, I just wanted to get that off my chest. Let the moral outrage commence.

EDIT: Hey guys, thanks for all the words of support. I‚Äôd always suspected I wasn‚Äôt the only one in this situation but the confirmation really helps. A couple details I didn‚Äôt include are that I do indeed work from home, but I make myself sit in front of the computer because I feel I must ‚Äúbe at my desk‚Äù for the most part. Also, I have the kind of job where I‚Äôm not allowed to take outside work, and I‚Äôm restricted in a lot of things that I‚Äôd like to do extracurricularly. But I‚Äôm saving up my pennies and hopefully in a few years I‚Äôll be able to do something else, like writing or maybe teaching ‚Äì or maybe in that time I‚Äôll figure out a way to be happy with my current situation so I can continue to do what I do.

Writing was never my strong suit and while I was decent at writing what I was told to write, it was never up to snuff and was always edited by the partners. Covid really effected my work because a lot slowed down because of it. 

After having enough of the insurance defense world, I switched to being a real estate attorney for a solo practitioner which I love doing but there is not much money in the field compared to others. It is good but I make a fraction of what I could be making in other fields. I feel the need to change careers since I can barley qualify for a mortgage where I currently live but I'm at a cross roads on where to go. 

The real estate market is slow right now so I don't see myself getting a raise anytime soon but at the same time, I don't necessarily want to go back to insurance defense work. I've applied for other jobs but I feel at times I'm not qualified to do anything other than what I've already done.

I used to joke that that I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to go to a top tier school so I could get a lousy hourly job in big law. Then I went in-house and my job stopped being hourly. ""Billable hours"" weren't the only deliverable, the culture wasn't so domineering, and the hours weren't terrible. I also began to study the business a bit more, and even got exposed to some game theory (love working with math nerds).

Corporate law, as commonly practiced, has fundamentally broken incentives, and I can't figure out why it persists. Every other white collar sector I'm aware of has realized that paying people by the hour doesn't get people what they want. For the service provider, it incentivizes us to pack the hours, to do things inefficiently, and to abstain from adopting tools that could make us more efficient or effective. For clients, they're (mostly) not paying for results, but for process.

Im a recent graduate of law school, I took the July BAR exam and got barred in mid-November due to how long the BAR Association took to give me my number. I‚Äôm a prosecutor for a county misdemeanor and I‚Äôve been at my office for about four months (I was hired in October before being barred). And I‚Äôm finding out that criminal law just isn‚Äôt where my heart is. 

I went to law school hoping to do compliance work for an agency. Due to Covid, most of my agency internships got canceled but I was able to do felony level internships at county district attorneys offices and I liked the job when it was there. But now that I am with misdemeanors, it‚Äôs just clicking for me that I‚Äôm not passionate about this. I don‚Äôt feel good going to work many days. There are times where helping a victim or creating a really reasonable offer that everyone can agree on feels good, but for the most part, this population of defendants breaks my heart and I mainly feel that I could be helping out more with my skills not in this position. Furthermore, it‚Äôs burning me out beyond measure emotionally. 

Worse is that my office is critically understaffed so I‚Äôve been having to come in sick as a dog, and we have such a huge backlog that I‚Äôm not just being pushed in the deep end, I feel like I‚Äôm being held underwater. I can‚Äôt really be mentored or taught even though my office tries because everyone is so busy.

This job feels mainly like people skills, which are great to sharpen, but I‚Äôd like more than this. 

My goal was to stay here one year, get a trial or two under my belt and then leave. I don‚Äôt know if I can wait that long. There‚Äôs a job with an agency that sounds like my dream. I‚Äôd love to apply for it, but I‚Äôm not even six months in, and I feel like I should chip away an extra month because that first month I wasn‚Äôt much help. I don‚Äôt want to abandon my office. They‚Äôre good people, I like them a lot, it‚Äôs just the job that‚Äôs not for me. 

 I‚Äôm exhausted and burnt out and frightened I‚Äôm going to have to do my first trial alone when I was told when I first started that wouldn‚Äôt be the case, but we‚Äôre running so thin that there‚Äôs no way two of us could be out for a trial ‚Äî we can barely handle one.  I don‚Äôt know if I give a shit about waiting to do a trial anymore anyway. I‚Äôm just wanting to move onto a different area of career but I feel like it‚Äôs too soon. 

I tell my family that I‚Äôm thinking about leaving and they blow a gasket that I‚Äôd leave before a year. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll last the year though considering how fried I feel.

379,458,Returning to MBB before law career?,1117hi8,"Hi everyone! TIA for any and all advice. I‚Äôm currently an analyst at an MBB consulting firm and am planning to apply for law school this fall. 

There have been some good parts of consulting, but I am ultimately not very passionate about consulting or business in general and have wanted to be a litigator my whole life. I‚Äôve always had a strong passion for trial law (e.g college mock trial, past classes), but got a little too caught up in the consulting recruiting craze at my college and am now looking to return to my initial goal of law.

At my firm, analysts have the option to have JD/MBA degrees or JDs partially paid for (JDs without the MBA with special approval only). I am still trying to navigate the exact rules and whether I should get a JD/MBA or just JD (if I‚Äôm not able to get the JD-only approval, the JD/MBA may actually end up cheaper). In order to have my law degree partially paid for, I‚Äôll need to return to my consulting firm for at least 2 years after law school graduation. 

My question overall is whether returning to MBB for 2 years after law school will ruin my chances to transition into a law career after those 2 years, ideally at a midsize or small law firm. My ultimate goal is to work for the DOJ and I don‚Äôt mind if it takes me a while to get there, but I want to make sure I don‚Äôt ruin my chances at a law career and the DOJ by returning to MBB first.

The other option I am considering post law school is to go in to Biglaw for a few years to pay down my debts. I would heavily prefer to go back to MBB for a few reasons-1) Given I have worked there for 3 years, I am familiar with the work and culture; 2) Even though biglaw salaries are slightly higher, MBB would help me pay my loans faster given they‚Äôd pay for 1/3 to 1/2 of my JD (or JD/MBA) in addition to a salary that would still be quite good; 3) Even though my time in MBB has been brutal hours-wise (a couple of all nighters, a few 18-20 hour straight work days), it still seems way better than Biglaw (I have never had to work a weekend, holiday, or vacation day and some cases are only like 50 hrs a week); 4) While I believe my dream job is law and I‚Äôm going to love it, I know a lot of people hate it, and going back to MBB for those 2 years after law school would allow me to more easily transition back to the business world in the event that I end up disliking law (unlikely, but I am extremely risk averse).

One final piece is that if I return to MBB first, I could potentially try to do a rotation/be an assistant to our in-house counsel division. However, I haven‚Äôt discussed this with my firm yet so I have no idea if it would be allowed. I also don‚Äôt know how helpful it would be given I want to do litigation rather than corporate law and it wouldn‚Äôt be anything like BL training, but it could help me do a little bit of law work during my 2 years at MBB.  

As evidenced above, I would really prefer to go back to MBB for 2 years rather than Biglaw, but I am worried that doing so could make me unable to find a law job afterwards. I‚Äôm open to small firms, midsize firms, DA‚Äôs offices, clerking, etc. so am not too picky with law jobs, as long as they‚Äôre solid enough to eventually get me to the DOJ long-term. 

Would going back to MBB for 2 years ruin my chances to get a job in law? Would the answer change if I stayed at MBB for 3 years instead since salary spikes in year 3? I plan to do my internships in law and even heard of a girl in my same position at my firm push her law offer 2 years to go back to MBB first, but her offer was in transactional BL whereas I‚Äôd look for jobs in midsize litigation most likely (or DA‚Äôs offices) which I could see being different.

Additionally, I‚Äôve heard that BL gives a great legal training foundation for those wanting to go into the DOJ-would I be able to get a solid training program in a midsize or small firm, or is it expected that most people at those firms start in BL first?

Doing my fair share at home responsibilities (my fianc√© is not not too happy that I just hyper focus on work and forget to do other house /dog chores, maintaining relationships with friends, I don‚Äôt have any hobbies or past times, can‚Äôt seem to make it to the gym either).

Things just feel very out of control at the moment and I‚Äôm constantly feeling overwhelmed and anxious and never have me time.

I‚Äôm due to start medication soon and I‚Äôm really hoping this will help.

Any tips or advice would be much appreciated.

397,485,2L FREAKING OUT about future C+F Application,10yfpxg,"Hi everyone, throwaway account. I am literally like freaking out writing this right now. I'm a 2L and plan on applying for admission in NY. I'll cut to the chase. Last year, literally at the very beginning of my 1L year, I was with a friend who got an AmEx credit card. I decided to apply for one on of my own and have had multiple other CCs (not with AmEx) before. The issue is I put down an income that is WAY higher than I made at the time in an attempt to get approve because I heard that you should use what you would reasonably expect to make if you didn't already have that income. Thinking I'm about to start law school and be a lawyer eventually, I'll put a pretty nice salary. They ended up asking me for some form of verification, but figuring that since it's something I couldn't really prove since it was just speculation, I didn't provide anything and they just denied the application about a day later or something.

I didn't really think anything of this until I saw something saying you can use projected income if it's within A YEAR or so of when you will reasonably make it. Now obviously at the time in early 1L I could not reasonably expect to make that kind of money within 1 year. Like I said I have a few other credit cards but never put a salary like that when I applied for them. *Edit to say that I have had carried credit card debt in the past, but have never missed a minimum payment/defaulted on any account and currently have a 750 score and no longer carry any CC debt and pay off cards in full at the end of the month.*

I'm now reading up on all of this credit fraud stuff and obviously that's scaring me but I'm also SUPER worried about Character and Fitness. I will be in a lot of debt due to law school and now it started to weigh on me that I could possibly get denied admission and literally never be a lawyer after all of this time and money. AmEx denied the application at the time and according to their website I seemed to have applied to them again another time last year, but I do not believe I used a salary like the one I used in the earlier application, that one was also denied. They have never reached out to me about it (nor has anyone else) and as of now no legal action has been taken against me. As I started to freak out about this I went and obtained my official credit report from all three major credit bureaus and it looks like the credit application will fall off my credit report by next Fall, about a year before I'd be doing the C+F application. I know that there are C+F attorneys and such but I am just so badly freaking out about this right now and am just so angry at myself for making such a dumb mistake that could literally ruin my career and future. What the hell do I do? From my research after learning about this it looks like it's pretty rare for people to get in legal trouble and usually they just deny your application and legal troubles usually happen if someone tries to declare bankruptcy and was given credit based on their incorrect income. Is this something that I should leave alone? Should I contact AmEx about it now even though it's been a long time? Is this something that if left alone C+F like investigates into (I am aware they look at credit generally but don't know if they go and take a look at every credit application you've ever submitted) I am so sorry for this long post but this is literally keeping me awake right now I am sick to my stomach.",Apart_Movie6834,34,0,0.5

410,501,Should I leave the law?,10xd1wo,"Sorry for the long note. Background - I went to law school and graduated in 2013.  I started out in a Big Law firm and moved over the years to a fairly decent in-house role.  It's well paid and stable and has been really interesting in more recent years. I am in my 30s now.  I definitely got to a point during law firm days in my 20s where I was constantly burnt out and stressed and hated everything about law and fantasized about leaving all the time.

In-house has been better but it is still stressful in a different way as I am quite senior and I do work around the clock a lot.  I am definitely still feeling burnt out, have very little time to myself and have become rather sedentary and unhealthy from the workload and expectations.

Over the last five years, I developed new interests and goals for myself outside of law and decided I wanted to change career completely. I took some preliminary steps towards making that happen such as taking some classes but never took the step of leaving my career altogether.  My dream for the last five years was to go back to grad school one day and facilitate a full career change to something more interesting and meaningful to me.

I now have an offer from one of the world's leading schools to do my MS and the funds to be able to take a year off to do that. It feels exhilarating to think about doing that and I have actually accepted the offer but I am having some serious second thoughts. Not because I don't want to do my MS - that's my dream. But it means saying goodbye to my whole career and life in the law and it feels quite scary doing that when I have been in it for a decade and progressed - particularly as that will happen in just six months or so.  Money is a huge thing that I am having a very hard time getting past - I am fortunate to earn six figures after working my way up. To leave that to ""follow my dream"" feels obnoxious almost given all the layoffs taking place. 

I also feel like I am the only one I know in law taking this path - all of my friends are lawyers and committed to making partner or GC one day, which is something is already starting to happen in my friendship age group.  I guess I am kind of grieving my career already.

I am worried about not making money when I finish the course, worried about tanking a career I've spent a decade building and worried that going back to school is just objectively a bad thing to do in your 30s during peak earning and progression years.  I'd be starting out a whole new career in my 30s when everything about law is so familiar. But the truth is that I have mostly been miserable in law from day one. I hate the constant stressing and cleaning up of messes. In-house is okay but it can be even worse than a firm at times - the difficult stakeholders, the blame culture, the total chaos, the politics, the time zones, the very different pressures, the strategy stuff.

I feel like I would really regret not taking this planned pause and pursuing my dream, but it feels really weird doing it at this age and time in my career. I also want to use the year to not just complete my MS, but to take some time to myself, get into healthier routines again and get my mind and body to a good place. They've both taken a beating over the last decade and I want to get back to who I was and maybe travel to a few places too and see family more.

411,503,Can't stop making mistakes. Need to vent to fellow lawyers.,10wsinw,"Hey all, I've been lurking here for awhile and finally decided to post.  I'd like to get all your input on a problem I've been having for the past few months.  I don't really know what I'm looking for by posting this.  I'm in the midst of a panic attack and I just want to vent and see what you guys think.

To give you my background, I was admitted to the bar back in July 2018 and was hired by a small personal injury firm a few months later.  For the first year or so working at the firm I was relegated to churning out demand letters, client intake, etc.  Basically, paralegal work.  By year two I was doing one mediation every few months and had one arbitration in total.  Almost my entire job was filing volumes of boiler plate complaints and summons and then non-suiting them when the matters settled.  By the end of year three I had taken one deposition, worked on one trial and been involved in one discovery dispute.  Neither I nor the other associate were allowed to negotiate settlements with opposing counsel using any other tactic than simply exchanging numbers.

What I'm trying to say I don't feel like this job prepared me to be an attorney.  I felt like I barely knew more than when I left law school and, honestly, it made me feel insecure when I would talk to associates at other firms.   I received nothing but praise from my boss regarding my performance, but that didn't help much.

Anyway, it was in my third year that I and the one other associate at the firm decided to quit.  Our rationale was (1) we were glorified paralegals and there was no upward mobility at the firm and (2) our boss--the lead attorney--had become extremely toxic (e.g., he told me that going to the bathroom 15 minutes after arriving at the office was ""stealing from the firm,"" because I should have just gone before I left home).

I was unemployed for a few months after that.  I did some traveling, and then landed at another firm that did covered basically every subject area: wills, corporate contracts, personal injury, civil rights, etc.  There were three partners at the firm and each one had assigned me tasks, and I was expected to bring on clients of my own.  I was fired two months in, but still got some decent work experience under my belt while I was there.  I don't know exactly why I was fired.  I was told my billable hours, work performance and everything was unobjectionable, but that I ""wasn't a good fit.""  I can get more into this if you guys want.

After that, I was unemployed until March 2022, at which point I was hired by a solo practitioner who specializes in real estate law, with an emphasis on landlord-tenant law.  During my interview, I explained that I had little to no litigation experience, no substantial, practical, post-graduate experience in *any* legal subject except personal injury, and would require extensive tutelage.  Mind you, I did not state this in a self-pitying manner.  I just wanted to temper expectations.

This is where I currently work, as the sole associate working under a single lawyer.  It has been rocky to say the least.  The problem, to put it simply, is there are so many things I don't know I don't know.

For example, in my state eviction notices have to state the move-out date.  For 14-day eviction notices, 3-day eviction notices and 60-day evictions notices determining the move-out date is simple: it's the last day of the notice period.  However, for 120-day notices, the move-out date is the notice period *plus the remaining days until the next rental period* (i.e., the next month).  This means, if 120 days out from the date of service is March 28th, the move-out date must be plugged in as March 31st.  My boss had me knock out the other types of notices for a few months and then about four months ago told me to do some 120-day notices.  The notices don't cite to the statute and it just didn't occur to me to dig into the law to verify that ""120-days"" means ""120-days.""  My boss didn't have me research for the other notices, he just gave me exemplars and told me to work off those.  I just assumed, and plugged in wrong move-out dates.  Now, four months later, none of the notices are valid and he's pissed.  The worst part is about a couple months ago he told me this about how 120-day notices work (completely unrelated to the prior mentioned work) and I forgot to resend the notices with proper move out dates.  I should've remembered, but it fell between the cracks I guess.

There's been other stuff as well, I left the judgment amount in a default judgment summary blank, because I swear I saw that in an exemplar, and a judge left it blank, so I have to get the judgment amended (the error that prompted to make this post).  I've misstyped case numbers in captions incorrectly on more than one occasion.  I missed a deadline to apply for costs as a prevailing party in my first appeal from a court of limited jurisdiction, thankfully per the rules it's a very soft deadline, but still.  I had a corporate client send me a notice to evict a post-foreclosure occupant, but they got the name of the occupant wrong and I didn't verify that with the auditor before drafting and sending out a complaint based on it.  I used an exemplar complaint for an individual plaintiff as my template for all my complaints--be they individual plaintiffs or LLCs--meaning for the LLC Plaintiffs the line about how the LLC is valid is absent.

These are just the big ones.  I feel like I can't go a single day without making some sort of error or leaving a typo in a document and no matter how much I re-read my documents I can't catch them.

My boss said that my problem is I'm not ""intellectually curious,"" and that If I was these errors would not have happened, and that each error ""chips away"" at his reputation.  He said that his practice area is narrow and he doesn't understand how I don't get it.  He's right, it is narrow, but it's still complicated! There are a lot of moving parts and the rules are different not just county-by-county and city-by-city.  I don't think my boss is going to accept ""I've never done this before"" as an excuse for much longer, and that certainly won't fly with any of the clients.  Given the sheer volume of my and my bosses workload it is not practical for him to review everything I do, and I'm afraid If I ask him to do that he'll start to see me more as a liability than anything else and fire me.

I will say this, once I learn something is a mistake I don't do it again.  And these are not mistakes made in the face of instructions to do the contrary.   My boss also said I'm an excellent persuasive writer and legal researcher.  For what it's worth.

It's just stuff trips me up, or I don't know I don't know things.  I fell like I'm an okay attorney overall but I'm so inexperienced and so non-detail oriented it seems like that I've started seriously considering changing careers.

414,508,Career advice-stick with what I have or try something new?,10wndry,"I have a dilemma about my job. I took a jd advantage job out of law school thinking I would springboard it into a practicing job in the same industry. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I love my job. The pay is pretty good, the benefits are excellent, I work super normal hours, the office is flexible, my coworkers are great, and I feel like I‚Äôm contributing in a positive way. I could, in theory, see spending my career here. The only real issue is the original reason I went to law school was because I was a paralegal and got tired of telling people I couldn‚Äôt give them legal advice. In my current job when an attorney gets involved I have to bring in an attorney from the legal department of my company. It irks me a little bit each time this happens.

BUT, a few weeks ago I was browsing job listings for a friend looking for a job, and I came across a job ad for what was my dream job when I was in law school. I applied on a whim and to my surprise, they called me back for an interview. The interview went great. They‚Äôve run the background check and contacted my references so I think they are getting ready to offer me the job. It‚Äôs a job practicing law in a field related to what I am doing now. But, it could mean more hours, more stress, and I‚Äôd be throwing away my pretty great situation on an unknown. If this has happened right out of law school I would have taken this job in a heartbeat but now I don‚Äôt know. Any advice?

I am looking for opinions on not job-hunting during the clerkship, ending in August, and being intentionally jobless for 4-5 months until beginning to look again in January.

There are a couple reasons I would want to do this. By the end of this clerkship, I will have worked 3 years since law school without really any break (started first job (state agency) a week after the bar exam, then was required to start this clerkship without any break after ending first job). I am getting married in late August and want to do a honeymoon, which would account for a couple weeks. But mostly I have some other life projects I would love to focus on for a couple months, I do painting and had recently started getting into exhibitions and shows before starting this clerkship, which pretty much killed my free time. I don‚Äôt intend to paint full time or anything but it would be great to give that some attention for awhile.

Worth mentioning also that I have decent savings and that my fiancee would be working, which would provide health insurance. Also this could be a time to really look at next jobs and not rush into it. I have been pretty swamped so haven‚Äôt really been job hunting as much as my fellow clerks.

What do you think? Would this be a red flag that would set me back, or would this be a non-issue?

When I asked my bosses if there was potential for an active shooter situation (I'm up front at the reception desk) they didn't seem worried and told me it happens a lot. In this case the woman is mentally ill and her counsel and parenting coordinator (a former prison psychologist) have also dropped her.

Well it's been three weeks and it's been quiet on my end,  but I spent all day organizing a binder of evidence for a hearing they have against her for custody on Monday. In the Binder are 16 emails of her harrassing and threatening my boss, basically saying she hopes she dies and she gets what's coming to her, etc.

In text messages between her and her kids, when she's accused of saying she's going to shoot people, she dismisses it saying that it's silly because she doesn't have access to a gun...that wasn't the response I was hoping for.

Anyways, I'm terrified. I'm afraid this hearing on Monday will set her off - there's a chance she'll lose custody of her kids and she'll come into the office for revenge. And there's me, all by myself in the front.

But I learned something today. The party that filed the police reports just filed a completely unrelated lawsuit pro se, and sort of mentioned the police reports in court documents.   The wording says: ""\[The party\] was forced to press charges agains the assailant, who lived LOCATION on DATE, after a physical assault  by the assailant.""

Nobody ""pressed charges."" The party in question, who is prone to exaggeration, filed a police report for a physical assault in which he received a scratch. A few days later he filed another report where there was a shouting match in the lobby.

I want to guide my client on how to request an appeal from the police department.

The median billable rate for a solo practitioner with their own office is $250, yet the gross income of the same group is just $144,500. With two weeks of vacation a year, that means they're billing just 2.41 hours per workday on average. 

I know in big law and stuff you'll be able to bill as many hours and do as much work as you want. However, I have no desire to bill 8+ hours a day long term, but billing <3 hours per day seems like the opposite extreme. Do solo practitioners even tend to have a billing structure that often? I guess I'm concerned that this is a marketing/workflow issue rather than a deliberate choice by the lawyers to work less. If I went to an average law school could I realistically bill 4-6 hours per day as a solo practitioner with a median billable rate?

468,571,6 months into first legal aid job and on the verge of a breakdown,10qym26,"TW: self harm, mental illness, etc.

Hi everyone, sorry for bleakposting in advance. I graduated in 2022, passed the bar, and I am currently working my first post-grad job as a housing attorney for a legal aid organization. I [posted here a few months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawyertalk/comments/xmjlvs/how_to_thrive_in_chaotic_public_interest_office/) about how bad things are in my office, and I really appreciate everyone's kind and honest feedback.

Long story short: my boss is completely absent -- I hear from her maybe 1-2x a week w/ critiques on something I did days prior. When I started I was 1 of 4 attorneys on my team, and all of them have now left due to toxic working conditions. There is no mentorship, no guidance, and I have 40+ cases assigned to me and I am still not even licensed. I feel completely alone and responsible for so many families on the brink of homelessness with literally no one to turn to (and yes I try to call/text/email my boss constantly; yes people have brought her failings to her attention in the past and she just does not care).

It's just now hitting me how bad things have gotten. I have nightmares about this job. My body is riddled with aches and pains. I feel myself turning to weed and alcohol to cope with the stress more nights than not. I wake up every morning dreading sitting at my desk and increasingly spend my days distracted and dissociating, not even caring about the work. I feel withdrawn from my friends and loved ones and activities and hobbies I love. Even doing the bare minimum at work, I still feel like this job is slowly but surely chipping away at my will to live. I absolutely cannot keep doing this job or I am worried I will have an actual breakdown.

I have been applying for other jobs, but the fact that I am still not licensed I am sure is not helping my case. I am also feeling so much shame and doubt questioning whether I even want to do this work. How much of a failure will I feel like if I just gave myself $150K in student debt, 3 years of law school, just to seek out another job less than a year after I graduated?

I am not sure what I even want to get out of this post. Part of me wants to just vent and get what I've been feeling out into the world. Part of me wants to hear if other people have experienced similar feelings and how they overcame them. Part of me wants to know that I am not a failure if I decide to take my career in a different direction.

I was hired by a big law firm around a year ago. I remember during the interview that I was asked if I wanted to go to law school and I said that I wasn't really sure. I took the LSAT 4 times and did well but I had also been working at a small firm that I hated. I was taken advantage of, had money, stole from me, and was treating like garbage by many attorneys. It really put me off the idea of going to study law and I thought that I would put off applying. However, my new firm was amazing and I truly loved it and it helped bring back the spark and confirm that law is the path I want to take.

I applied to several schools and got scholarship offers to a number of top 10 schools, which I'm super thankful for. Most schools start in August. I haven't told my job that I've applied to schools, let alone has been accepted. I'm just afraid they will fire me on the spot for doing so despite not being given any reason to believe that they would do so. I plan on giving them over 30 days notice so they can find a replacement and to alleviate the burden of me leaving. I just don't know what to tell them when they ask why I'm leaving. I thought about making some excuse like, ""I really just want to move"" or something but I just don't know. I know that when I try to be admitted to the bar, they will run a Character & Fitness investigation and will probably contact HR.

Most notably, my (now former) boss installed a lot of cameras. For example, he had cameras everywhere, including facing the bathroom doors so he could see how long employees were in there. And it quickly became apparent that these cameras have microphones on them and he could hear office conversations through them. This was then confirmed by the office manager. 

He began calling employees into his office and accusing them of being disloyal or dishonest with him based on a conversation that he listened to through the cameras. I soon began to suspect that he had recording devices elsewhere, but I don‚Äôt have confirmation of that. I do know he recorded all phone calls, as the office manager was tasked with listening to these phone calls and the conversations that she could hear through the cameras and that‚Äôs what she spent most of her day doing. 

I‚Äôm out now but I feel really icky about the whole thing. My state is a one party consent state, but he was never a part of any of these conversations. He recorded and listened to conversations between other people. Illegally recording someone without their knowledge or consent is a felony in my state, but my former boss personally knows the DA.

492,604,Career Advice for a Part-Time Law Student and Full-Time Gov't Employee,10ofrr3,"Hello currently practicing legal professionals. I am seeking your opinions on a career decision that I am quite hung up on right now.

**Question:** Should I leave my legal-adjacent position working for the federal government to become an attorney after passing the bar?

**Background:** I am a part-time law student in my final semester at a T50 school. I was on law review and am in the top 1/3 of my class for grades. I'm 31 and I attended law school on a part-time basis so that I could continue working in my full-time job as a Program Analyst for a federal agency during law school. During law school I continued to get promotions/pay raises in that position and I'm now nearing the end of law school with little debt and a job that pays a bit over $100k. I like my current position and coworkers. The work is non-legal but legal-adjacent. I work on policy matters and get to use my legal research and writing skills for advocate for policy positions or work on legislative proposals.

I'm scared of the possibility that leaving this position might mean a lower salary in the short-term, more difficulty to build my skills as an attorney and some risk that I end up in a less-fulfilling role with less enjoyable coworkers. However, I've also loved my law school classes and think I would feel a lot of fulfillment from practicing law.

So in sum, I like the position that I'm in now a lot, but I fear that I'm making a big mistake by not practicing after completing law school and passing the bar.

I feel like I have three options -- (1) pivot out of gov't into practicing law ASAP, (2) stay in my current position and continue my non-legal career or (3) try to mix the two by continuing my current role while seeking out opportunities to either practice law within the federal government or take on more legal responsibilities.

I would appreciate any advice or opinions that the practicing attorneys on this subreddit have to share. Thanks!

Background information: Current 3L having my last semester in a middle ranked law school in NYC. I was a transactional paralegal for 9 years before law school. I have been working with a real estate law firm since 2L. No post graduate position offered yet.

This real estate law firm offered post graduate position to all the summer associates in the litigation department and put all of us in transactions department as pending. I am still working with them during my last semester but they made it clear that it doesn't mean thay they will offer me, because under this economy, the firm does not know its need for additional associates. Decision will be made in March.

I understand that I should apply for other firms instead of waiting for March to come. Many law school classmates told me I shouldn't be worried because of my legal experience, but I'm very worried now. Most associate job postings are asking for 3-5 experience which I don't have, and all of them are for immediate hire which I won't be available to work full time until after bar exam.

My questions are 1) whether it is appropriate for me to apply to a position that requires some experience? 2) Is there better platforms/recruiters for me to look for firms that are interested in hiring new associate in August/September instead of immediate hire? 3) Does cold emailing law firms appropriate and/or effective?

To summarize, she was a paralegal for a immigration firm up until very recently for about a month leading up to now that did some very morally questionable stuff and she's anxious that these things may be commonplace in the US legal profession. 

My girlfriend found evidence while working there that they would put their clients on payment plans and then weeks before their hearing he would demand the remainder of all the payments, if they didn't pay he would file a motion to withdraw under the guise of ""they have not contacted me in X months/years"" when in some cases they had literally talked days ago. He would also call his clients ""fucking bitch"" etc. in the mass FB Messenger group the firm used to communicate. She also found some instances of judges calling him out on these motions to withdraw and that they were no longer taking cases for clients that had those judges. 

He also would ""hire"" paralegals asking them to come on site (usually to his own house at first) but not negotiate exact pay or have any employment documents signed for several days, and if someone hired in this manner just stopped showing up (which due to how shady this is, they frequently did) he would just never pay them. Although in many cases paralegals were just asked to not come back after a few days to a week, all in all leading to them burning through 6-7 paralegals a month.

530,657,How long for breaks during the day??,10kpinw,"Hello lawyers,

I am an Articling Student, just finished law school. In my previous jobs in business I would take a 10 minute walking break in the morning when I got a few tasks done. In the afternoon I would take another 10 minute walking break. For lunch I would just eat and work.

My question is now that I work in a Law office, when can I take walking breaks outside? I know there are tasks that have to be completed and I do so, however it seems no one leaves the office unless they have to see a client. In my current firm no one goes out for fresh air and the only breaks they take is to go to the bathroom. Is this normal? I just can‚Äôt sit down for 8 hours a day and no walking at all.

534,661,Quitting after 7 years,10k8u8m,"After working as an aviation power plant machinist in the army, I took my English degree and went to law school on the GI bill. What else was I going to do?

I hated law school. So I graduated as quickly as possible, 2.5 years. 18 credits a semester while working for the DA‚Äôs office each semester since 2L. The stress of everything was so terrible, I would drink until I passed out. In the morning, I‚Äôd wake up, drive to the courthouse and litigate for four hours, go to law school until 8pm - didn‚Äôt pay attention, just studied for finals every second I decided to attend - go home, rinse and repeat.

I passed the bar and moved back to my hometown (top 4 largest cities in the US). There, I worked in the DA‚Äôs office for 64k per year, handling a cattle call of about 400 defendants twice a week. Two days a week were nothing but trials lasting 1-4 hours each. One day I worked in the office, prepping for upcoming cases. I made about $30 million per year on settlements and civil convictions for this office of the state, on that salary. The good thing is that as an attorney in the public sector, the loans I took out are being paid back. Having said all this, I loved that job. But I wanted to win everything, so I stressed myself to the max and continued to booze to my detriment.

Fast forward three years. Now I‚Äôm married with a mortgage and two kids. I get a call from my city‚Äôs fire and police department. I‚Äôm invited to enter the fire academy after I took the civil service exam during my first semester of law school. I completely forgot I took the test. Most likely, I was hungover. 

So I quit my job at the DA, got on the FD full time, 60 hours per week for double the money I made as a govt attorney, and started working on my off days as a family law attorney for a small firm with a great boss.

Family law practice in my state is a great place for private sector attorneys to cut their teeth. The rules are lax, and essentially every evidentiary hearing comes down to ‚Äútotality of the circumstances.‚Äù If we have the facts, I counsel my clients to proceed. If we don‚Äôt, settle for the best. Don‚Äôt jag them around for more money and the humiliation of looking like a total asshole in open court.

After four years of the above, my clients wore me down. All of them have unreasonable expectations and hear what they want, not what I‚Äôve told them. Additionally, I‚Äôve been moonlighting as a civil rights attorney for a national law firm. And I took a very part time position as a transactional attorney. Now, because I‚Äôve been so busy with two careers, a family, and general personal responsibilities, my reaching for the bottle is non existent. This doesn‚Äôt do any favors on my stress.

About two weeks ago I was floored with stomach pain. after several tests, I was told that, most likely, due to stress and alcohol, I have several perforated ulcers in my stomach and esophagus and need surgery. I recently was placed on paid leave from the fire dept, and I quit practicing law for an indefinite period.

I don‚Äôt know what the point of this rant is. But I read a lot of helpful stories on Reddit. As I sit hear waiting for biopsy results, I can honestly say that it‚Äôs been a blessing. I love being a firefighter, and although I‚Äôm a decent trial attorney, I hate the profession.

I suppose the moral is, if you‚Äôve given the practice a shot and didn‚Äôt quit after it got difficult, AND you still hate it - quit. It‚Äôs not worth your health. It‚Äôs not entirely a sunken cost. There‚Äôs more to life than often unappreciated work.",No_Address6707,25,94,0.97

537,666,Did I mess up this deposition?,10km1iw,"Doing insurance defense under a year so I‚Äôm still learning. While deposing Plaintiff I kept asking if the doctor recommended nearly a year ago to do further injections and restart chiro or physical therapy, and she didn‚Äôt, why did she wait so long?

First she said the pain returned in June and was gone at her last appt in March 2022. I asked if the doctor made a mistake recommending further injections and chiro (after was discharged in Jan. 2022)? Then she said she‚Äôs still planning to go back for treatment, saying she‚Äôs still in pain this whole time. 

I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this means a) the pain isn‚Äôt really that bad since she never sought treatment again since then or b) is it her fault if she‚Äôs in pain now and not the accident because she failed to follow the doctor‚Äôs advice?

Further, would it make sense and build her case if after all this time she suddenly goes back for treatment or it shows lack of credibility? It was like a really light sideswipe where the plaintiff driver before her depo said at his depo it was at 5 mph.

Found a job I'd like to apply for. Besides needing to be barred in my current jurisdiction (State A), they want applicants to be barred in another state I am not (State B).

There is reciprocity between State A and B after you've practiced for X years; it's simply a motion for admission with a few procedural requirements. I am eligible for this reciprocity later this year. 

Should I reference this on my resume somehow? I added a clause at the end of my cover letter alluding to this, but they may not even get that far if they only see State A on the resume. I understand that maybe they need someone for State B immediately, but if I am a good applicant otherwise, perhaps they'd be willing to consider me knowing I can do that work soon. 

Alternatively, maybe it'll be obvious to the firm that I can waive in soon and there is no need to spell it out on the resume.

The case is in state court 1.5hrs away and doesn‚Äôt use the state e-filing system which automatically serves the filings on all parties (although they accept filing via email). 

Partner and I filed a motion to dismiss or for a more definite statement, which the court granted, ordering plaintiff to file an amended complaint by October 18. The deadline rolls past with no amended complaint in sight (I‚Äôm checking the online register of actions daily), so in mid-November we file a renewed motion to dismiss, and for involuntary dismissal for failure to comply with court order. Hearing set for Jan 17, but last weekend the court clerk emails saying the can‚Äôt find our motion, and requesting a copy. We send, and the court adjourns our hearing, indicating that the motion would be decided without oral argument. 

Today we get the order denying our motion and stating that the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 18, but never served it. Sure as shit, I check the register of actions and there‚Äôs an entry on October 18 showing filing of an amended complaint.

This split doesn't seem fair since I'm an associate with no ownership I don't shoulder 1/3 of the expenses just like I don't gain 1/3 of the profits.

My hypothesis is that there are a lot of niches for online legal services that are too small for people like LegalZoom to serve well, but that would be big enough for a lawyer to make a living off of.

595,737,"Lawyers, never throw your support staff under the bus",10eywzd,"This is one of my top rules. Don't do it when they actually make a mistake, and certainly do not do it behind their backs to cover for your own mistake in front of a client, OC, or court. 

1. If I make a mistake, I make sure that my legal assistant knows that =I know= that I made the mistake. I will clearly tell her ""I am the one who screwed that up"" so that there is no ambiguity. Even if we were both in error on something, I make sure she knows that I take 100% responsibility for my part in making the mistake. 
2. If I have to clear up a mistake that I made with OC or a court, I will CC my legal assistant on that communication so that she knows that I won't chalk the mistake up to ""staff error"" behind her back to cover for my own mistake. I just did that today (hence this post). 
3. If she makes a mistake, I'm the lawyer, it's my law firm, and I'm ultimately responsible for it. So I will have my law firm take public responsibility for it without pointing out anyone in particular. I can speak to her privately. 

And, I always recognize the proven truth that my legal assistant makes less mistakes than I do. I cannot expect her to be more ""perfect"" than I am. 

Earlier today, I was talking to a former paralegal who has horror stories of attorneys throwing her under the bus to protect their own egos, when she made a (fixable) mistake, or when they made a mistake and didn't want to take responsibility for it. It caused her a lot of pain as a young paralegal. 

Do not throw your staff under the bus. If you do, you are treating them as disposable, and less valuable than you as a person.

596,738,Should I Quit Being a Lawyer?,10fe13i,"So, ever since law school, I have struggled with whether or not I should be an attorney. This mainly started in law school because that time was basically hell for me. Although I know it's like that for most people. I felt I could barely keep up with all that was expected of me, and on top of that, I did very poorly in my legal writing class my 1L year. So you can imagine how me thinking I can't WRITE like a lawyer would lead me to have some issues. 

My first job out of law school I was a judicial clerk for a civil judge who pretty much did everything himself, all I had to do was summarize very simple motions, i.e., requests to extend discovery or default judgments. Very easy. My next job after that I worked at a general litigation firm in a very small town with a bunch of very old lawyers. Again I didn't have a lot of responsibilities or difficult job duties. Mainly just drafting up very simple wills or estate documents, or dealing with municipalities when they would ask, hey, can you update our policy for our library employees?

After almost 2 years of making 60K with a dying firm, I decided to look elsewhere. I got a job at an elder law firm in a more metropolitan area. My job was drafting up trusts, wills to go with those trusts, and dealing with some trust and estate administration and probate. I didn't even last 3 months. I was in way over my head and couldn't do things fast enough (especially getting the hang of dictation which was a PAIN IN THE ASS) and didn't put in enough time to suit my bosses. They had one meeting with me to discuss that I wasn't meeting expectations, then I was fired a month later. 

After that, I had to kind of scramble to find something else with my rent payments looming. I found another job with a firm that does real estate and land use development (sound boring? that's because it is). They knew I didn't have much experience in their field but seemed willing to train me. After about a year, I asked for a performance review. It didn't go great. They said everyone in the office liked me, but I had problems with my legal writing and work product. Things were going out incorrectly, I didn't handle one planning board hearing well, etc. That was in October. 

Last month we had our year end reviews. I thought it would go well because a brief I recently worked on got complimented (by the partner I did it with) and my ability to handle a hearing has improved GREATLY, IMO. 

But of course, it didn't go well. They informed me that I still wasn't meeting expectations and that because of that I would not be getting a raise or a year end bonus. I argued my way into a small raise and a year end bonus after having to explain to my bosses that according to me, I was improving. But I still feel...like a fuck up. I still feel like I don't know what I'm doing and that no matter how hard I try or how much I proofread or ask questions, I will make mistakes. Hell, EVERYONE makes mistakes. But I'm so afraid a mistake will get me fired.

So, at what point do I throw in the towel and try to find another profession, or at least another area of the law that doesn't make me roll my eyes. I find it so incredibly difficult to care about what I'm doing and I think therein lies the main problem. It's hard for me to be good at something I don't care about, and then it becomes even harder when I constantly feel like I SUCK at what I'm doing. 

I don't have a lot of other attorney friends (because law school was terrible), so I'm hoping some of you out there will have had similar experiences?

I'm flummoxed. I was not the person who interviewed them or had any part in the hiring process but I know the person who did and he basically said how good a resume this person had. I visited this person's linkedin and indeed, the resume looks good, 6-7 years at one firm, 2-3 years at a well-known big law firm, good law school, one ringing endorsement about their intelligence and skills. Apparently the person made a comment on starting with my firm to one of my colleague's that they were taking a huge pay cut to even work at our firm. But this person was completely incompetent in my opinion, utterly useless, and one of the worst hires we have ever had and my firm is not small 60-100 lawyers (this person was also given a really high starting salary given the experience they supposedly came in with, suffice it to say, the boss was not sorry to see this person leave, we were all relieved quite frankly). So what gives? How does someone make it through 8-10 years at other law firms and come out useless?  My working hypothesis is this person had an uncle or someone working at the first firm that kept them there awhile and probably hid in the background at the second (big law) firm until they were fired (I got the distinct impression they were fired based on some aside comments they made about the are of law they were in having less work to explain them leaving that firm).

646,808,Help Deciding on Job Opportunity,10ai9fj,"Could use some input on whether to accept a job offer or not.  I'm currently in house in a non-lawyer, but legal related role at a large company.  I previously was in private practice and made the jump last year (been in my current role around 7 months).  I really like the people I work with in my current role, the benefits are great including 4 months paid maternity leave (still on the fence about having kids) and there is a lot of flexibility in my schedule (plus no billable hours).  However, I don't feel very intellectually stimulated or challenged and miss actively being an attorney.  At least 50% of my job feels like busywork (it's necessary in a highly regulated field).  It's also a huge company so there is a lot of bureaucracy and red tape to getting anything done.  

I recently received an unsolicited job offer from a firm I had worked closely with when I was in private practice.  I'd definitely enjoy the type of things I'd be working on.  The primary reason I left my last job was because I was focused solely on litigation and wanted to do also work non-litigation things within my practice area.  When I left my last job, I wanted to go to another firm that would let me do both, but there were some politics at play between my firm and some of the others in the practice area.  So I decided to pursue in-house roles.

The pay is slightly better than my current job.  Most of the benefits and PTO are comparable, but I have no idea if/what their parental leave benefits are.  They very much want people in the office most of the time and I don't think I'd have a ton of flexibility plus I'd be returning to billable hours. I've enjoyed working with everyone at the firm, but obviously don't know how they'd be to work for.  I think going to the firm would probably give me more and better opportunities in the long run.

I think ultimately it comes down to whether I'd rather stay in a job that I don't feel intellectually satisfied in but which gives me more flexibility and no billable hours versus returning to private practice to feel more intellectually stimulated but which will likely not be as flexible in terms of my schedule.

I was happy to make the referral and I hope they represent the family to the best of their abilities. 

My question, is their etiquette involved in providing a referral fee in instances like this? While it was literally 5 minutes of my time, I did provide them an in with a case that is very likely to generate a 7 figure plus settlement.

Advice please.

Looking to transition from private practice to in house. Have mostly employment law experience.

It seems like in house counsel roles are more commercial law and you are usually a major internal stakeholder that works alongside or with other business partners / big players of the business. This sounds all good to me but what do I highlight on my CV / cover letter or at interviews which makes me stand out / suitable for in house roles?

In other words, what are good selling points for in house roles? What are good values and competencies to display (specifically for in house legal roles).

Bit of background:

Worked at two firms (1st - just over 1 year and 2nd - 4 months). 

Worked in an advisory role (employment law) for 2 ish years prior to moving to private practice roles (outlined above).

Speciality is employment law. Have had some exposure to litigation and criminal law (court attendances to represent clients etc).

Left 2nd private practice role in Dec 2022. Was not the right fit. Was completely unsupported and chucked in the deep end. Left to take time to reflect and decide what I wanted to do!

673,842,Balance between pay and wlb?,108rw50,"Hey, I'm curious to learn more about the balance between pay and wlb in law? I know there are many factors which go into it including location, firm, practice area, which partners you work with etc. However, there seems to be a general trend between big law having the best pay and worst wlb, and both pay/hours decreasing as you join smaller firms. I know that's not a catch all rule, but imo it seems to be generally true. There also is general knowledge that you're either in big law making bank and working tons of hours or not and making meh compensation for ok-ish (or even bad) hours.

I guess what I'm trying to get at, is if there's a sweet spot for people like me looking to work more than the traditional 40 hour work week, yet less than the 80 hour big law schedule which can hit during busy times. Are there big law or big law adjacent jobs where you put in 60 hour work weeks consistently and only very rarely have to put in an 80 hour week (and if you do it's a one off thing aka not back to back to back 80 hour weeks)? I've thought about going in house, but I'm more wondering about law specific firms. For example, in the graph I posted, a good 1k people go into firms sized 251-500 lawyers, yet are only making a bit less than big law. Are these 60 hour/week jobs, or basically the same hours as big law? Ty.

TL;DR: The rule of thumb is that after graduating you're either making 200k working 80 hour weeks in big law or making 80k working 50 hour weeks in a small firm. How many jobs are out there where you're making 180k working 60 hour weeks?

I recently moved to USA with an LLB and LLM (Industrial law) degree from India. I also worked as a legal associate in India for a couple of years in Mergers and Acquisitions. I am interested in pursuing a law career in USA. I live in Texas.

Here is what I found based on my research in different websites and I could not confirm which of the following information I know is accurate. Please correct if this is wrong.

1. Since India is considered as a common law country with US, I will be eligible to apply for profile review to the bar council (I heard it may take up to an year). If the council finds it okay, I will get a bar license to practice law without any exam.
2. I need to pursue a law degree in USA to get eligibility to attend the law exam. Once qualified, I will get the bar license.

Right now, I am not sure whom can I contact to find accurate information about what I can do next.

I am also not decided on the specialization in law that I need to pursue a career in USA. Any advise or experiences in different specializations will be highly appreciated. Please let me know if I can provide any additional details that will help me with an advise. Thank you so much!",FunAd1214,2,4,0.83

I'd like to work as inhouse counsel (if that's even an option) or in litigation at a boutique/small-medium firm in a small to very-small market in the Pacific NW (or remote for firms outside NW if possible - moving is not an option given my family situation). If neither is realistic then obviously prosecution. I'd be interested in thoughts on the possibility of either option given my situation:

My education: BSc. in Engineering Physics (EE ""adjacent"") from a reputable Northern European University, Master of Engineering Management from Duke and will have a JD from a low ranking (100+) law school in the NW region.

Experience: 6-7 years of experience working (as a patent engineer) with litigation defense of patent cases at the PTAB and District Court (IPR review, non-infringement and invalidity arguments etc.) and IP portfolio management (claim charting etc.) for an IP-heavy Fortune 500 tech company. Total industry experience about 20 years, my age will be mid-forties.

Given my semi-advanced age and current compensation, I'm hoping for a total compensation in the range of $180K. However, based on very anecdotal information + what I can glean from Glassdoor etc., it seems TC around $140K is more realistic, at least for prosecution?

(1) What's the likelihood that I'd be able to transition from being in a technical position with my agency to moving over to a legal position?

725,911,5 months into dream public interest job - too early to quit?,1035mis,"I'm about five months into the job I came to law school hoping for - direct legal services in a high-volume, fast-paced field in a major city. Interned in the area, including at my current employer, during my law school summers, but none of that prepared me for life as a staff attorney.

Our hours are decent, particularly for the legal field, but I leave work and can't stop worrying about my cases. I was given sole responsibility on all my cases, which has been an ongoing load of over twenty since I started, and my supervisor is too busy with other staff and apparently constant meetings to provide much guidance beyond our weekly hour-long check-ins (and quite often misses those as well). Several days a week in court in my busiest weeks, and while I've been getting generally favorable outcomes for my clients I dread every appearance and the constant confrontation with opposing counsel and judges whose decisions seem to rely more on their mood than any of the effort I put in to prepare. As an intern, I enjoyed playing a supportive role on casework and the more novel research and writing assignments I got to do, but now my time is balanced between writing routine motions, following up with often unresponsive clients as the clock ticks down on urgent court deadlines, and dealing with some of the nastiest personalities I have ever encountered on the opposing side of my cases.

My organization has been trying to make some changes to improve retention, after about a quarter of out unit has turned over in the months since I started. The people who've left all made it at least a year, but I'm really doubting whether I can do the same. My mental health has never been this bad - there are weeks where I cry daily; I dread starting work in the mornings, much less going to court, and have thoughts of physical harm over having to face the day; and while my coworkers are friendly everyone seems too constantly stressed to provide much support. I started seeing a therapist again for the first time in years, but it so far hasn't helped too much. I compare my job to friends in big law and when it comes to hours, pressure to perform, etc., I feel like a bit of a whiner feeling this way, but I managed law school, the bar exam, and two years at my job before law school with pretty minimal stress, so I feel like it really is this job getting to me.

I am passionate about the issue area I work in, but not sure how much longer I can cut it before my mental health starts dragging down my work and me with it. I've been casually browsing jobs, yet not sure if I even want to stay in the legal field as civil legal services was the only reason I really came to law school. Also concerned about how it will look quitting so soon after starting, particularly when my resume indicates plenty of interest of experience in the field I'm now giving up on.

Law clerk here, taking the bar in February.

&#x200B;

I have been a law clerk since about May at a small personal injury firm. There are 6 of us in total, 2 being attorneys. Things went well until we hired our most recent paralegal. I enjoy the comfort of my job, the clients, and the pay seems very  fair for the work. However, the following issues have arisen:

&#x200B;

The firm is EXTREMELY disorganized, to the point where clients have expressed how irritated and fed up they are. There are cases the attorneys will basically ignore for whatever reason, and as soon as the statute approaches everyone begins to freak out.

&#x200B;

The Paralegal likes to call me and the other paralegal and law clerk out by informing the attorneys of every and any mistake in an email (mind you she has only been here a few weeks). She likes to shift the blame on her mistakes though and the attorney seems to behave as if she can do no wrong. It is always me and the other staffs fault. To make matters worse, she completely ignores a ""hello"" or any type of friendly gesture. She was a supervising paralegal in the past and she seems to want to micro manage but is not a manager! To make matters worse, the attorney seems to disregard this behavior even though the other staff is beginning to feel bullied.

The attorney cancelled our holiday bonus due to ""personal issues"" right after the other law clerk coincidentally made a mistake.

When I apologize for my mistakes or ask for feedback I am completely ignored or made to feel like an idiot, receiving comments like ""it's common sense"" or ""if you just google it...."" when the matters are much more complex than that.

745,933,How to Spot Red Flags in Interview for In-House Position,101mqtb,"Greetings!

I need some help figuring how to spot red flags for an upcoming remote interview I have for an in-house position.  

I am a 2016 law school grad with solely litigation experience, including two clerkships, working at an AM200 firm, and now in the public sector.  For years, I‚Äôve been dying to go in house. 

I was recently invited to interview for an in house position, but a few things have raised concerns for me about the company.  

First, the company apparently had two attorneys but now has none.  The senior VP and general counsel retired.  I had a phone call with her, and her retirement seems natural.  Nothing fishy there.  The other attorney recently departed as well.  Not sure why.  The company decided it would post only for the junior attorney position with the thought that the posting would eventually grow into the GC role down the road.  The posting does say that the company leans on outside counsel.  Should I be concerned about being the sole in house attorney at a privately held company?  Again, sounds like I would have access to outside counsel, but I‚Äôd be going into this job with no in house experience myself.

Second, shortly after I applied, I was told that they were no longer interviewing and that they were preparing an offer letter to someone else.  Apparently that person leveraged the offer to stay where they were, which led to the company interviewing me.  Should I be concerned about this or is it normal?

Third, I reached out to the person who most recently held the job to learn more about the position informally, and to hopefully get a candid take on the company‚Äôs culture.  The person was pretty cold and just referred me to the company‚Äôs HR.  Part of me totally understands that the person just might not want to take the time to talk to a stranger, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that the person‚Äôs departure may have been sour.

This is a long way of asking what kind of red flags should I be looking for, and what types of questions should I ask, in the interview to better understand if the company would be a good fit for me.

I'm a blind Ukrainian.

Now I have a residence permit in both Britain and Canada for 3 years.

I'm a student of two universities in Ukraine. Next year I will get 2 degrees, bachelor of computer engineering and bachelor of laws.

I can work as a programmer. Moreover, it may allow me to obtain a permanent residence permit. In Canada it is a faster process as I could become a Canadian citizen in 4 years. In Britain, it may take about 10 years to do this.

But I would like to do what I like. I like law, I like defending people's rights. In Ukraine, I have already worked with authorities and courts, and even participated in cases in the Supreme Court.

As I know, my education, even if I get a master's degree in law in Ukraine, will not be enough. In Britain and Canada, I should get a local education.

But 2 things fit me. I don't have a lot of money and I'm not a genius.

Well, as far as I know, in Scotland there is the possibility of free higher education for Ukrainians. But for that, I have to live in Scotland.

My visa was originally sponsored by the Scottish government. But now I live in South East England.

Perhaps the best way for me would be to obtain British or Canadian citizenship, because in this case, I would be able to pay less for my education.

As far as I know, in the UK it will be enough for me to get Ll.M., but I have heard some opinions that if I want to become a good lawyer in the UK, I should get both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree.

In Canada, I hear the best way is J.D.

However, now my english level is about pre-intermediate (a2). It will take me some time to get my IELTS 7.5.

But I would like to be clear about my plan, what I'm going to do and how to get there.

If someone could help me with advice, I would be glad!

My issue is with client communication and organization. I am diagnosed with Autism & ADHD. 

My autism makes verbal communication very difficult for me, especially when I have not prepared a script to follow in advance. I often cannot answer spontaneous questions even if I know the answer because I need time to formulate an articulate response - I think visually (pictures, symbolism, feelings) and it takes time for my brain to translate this into words that people can understand. I‚Äôm also very direct and straightforward. For example, if I can‚Äôt do something for a client, I just flat out tell them that with little to no sugarcoating. Even in emails, I skip most of the social conventions and write directly.  Some clients appreciate this and some clients react emotionally. All of this to say that I find interacting with clients overwhelming and often so anxiety producing that I shutdown. 

I have about 90 clients currently. I was unmedicated for almost a month due to the adderall shortage. Then I was sick with a sinus infection. To top it all off, I finally saw an ent about my year long tinnitus. I have hearing loss and will need hearing aids. I‚Äôm still in my thirties.

As much as I love my firm and the people there, I just don‚Äôt know that I can have that life balance in complex civil litigation.

* Not meeting deadlines and/or not responding to inquiries about status.
* Producing a memo that either doesn't address the questions completely or is larded down with 20 pages of extraneous stuff that isn't relevant.
* Not getting invoices in by the time we need to close out a quarter or a year, even when given lots of lead time (which in turn gets us yelled at by the accounts payable people).
* Billing us 50 hours by a brand-new associate who would have needed 10 or less hours for the same work after a year or two of experience (i.e., not writing excess time like this off as training).

Curious to know the approach other in-house folks take when these issues arise, and what it would take for your organization to cut a firm loose. My own view is that it's a matter of four factors: communication, seniority, severity, frequency:

* Communication - this is kind of the kiss of death. If a lawyer simply stops responding to emails or voicemails from us or takes way too long (like 1 week+) to respond that's a voluntary failure in client service. I'm not talking about completing an assignment but rather just providing a quick response to an inquiry about the status of something. This assumes there's nothing unusual going on that created the issue (like the attorney having a sudden illness, etc.).
* Seniority - we have a few firms that have represented us for decades and know our organization inside and out. I'd be a lot more hesitant to end the relationship with one of these firms, but in case of a significant problem we have asked a firm like this to no longer assign a particular lawyer to work on our matters. On the other hand, if we have a problem with the first assignment we've given to a firm we've never used before, it's much more likely we'll never use that firm again.
* Severity - self-explanatory - at one end of the scale the firm has created a very significant problem for us in some way, at the other end of the scale it's just a minor annoyance.
* Frequency - one-time issue versus the development of a pattern.

In your organization, what does it take for you to have that internal discussion that results in a  ""we're no longer using this firm"" decision? How much effort do you spend communicating with a firm to try and resolve problems, versus ""going silent"" - just not sending them any more work?",JellyDenizen,16,27,1.0

Hey all so I'm a current 2l. I had an accelerated first year (this year) meaning I did my first year from January-August and then I completed my first semester of my 2L from September until the 22nd of this month (my last final). To say it's been a hard year is a complete understatement. I bombed my first semester and it literally crushed me since I never experienced failing before. My parents were also demanding a lot from me and after my first final during that time I got so sick from the stress that I experienced a substantial weight loss (15ish pounds). But, I doubled my GPA the second semester and even was acknowledged by the dean for outstanding academic improvement. However, I learned that I still lost my scholarship because my cumulative missed the requirement by a slim margin. I've always been a scholarship kid, I rely on scholarships and to lose it really pushed me into a depression. All of September and November I wasn't sure if I'd even still be able to attend but I still had to go and participate and aim for A's. 

This entire process has been extremely difficult, isolating, heartbreaking, and extremely character building. I feel like so many people in my life have been very upset with me because I just haven't been able to be available or as present. And im not just sure if I'm wrong? Like I'm open that I study all the time, I couldn't help but cry sometimes, I know I had a weight loss, and idk. I just feel like I'm at my lowest place ever but I'm still putting 100% but everybody around me is just make it harder. Either someone makes me feel guilty for not putting more effort into the friendship or makes me feel horrible that I can't just drop what I'm doing like I use to. I just can't give anymore, everything is going to school and I just don't have the luxury to not stay on top of it. I don't think  they're trying to understand where I'm coming from because they just downplaying how hard to school is or like how much I should be doing. 

It was a long read so sorry! It's been a year. Maybe I'm being dramatic?

23,27,"Read an article regarding a study which found 8.5% of lawyers have had suicidal thoughts, and racial and ethnic minorities were even more likely. That‚Äôs nearly one in ten lawyers, and more for racial and ethnic minority lawyers.",1192f14,"We really need to get better at treating each other better. This profession is inherently stressful. Tack on life‚Äôs other obstacles ‚Äî finances, relationships, etc. ‚Äî and it‚Äôs hard to see the light. I suspect one of the most common catalysts for suicidal thoughts is how one is treated by other lawyers, whether at one‚Äôs firm or adversaries. We often don‚Äôt treat each other like human beings. But we are! We must start acting accordingly or others may die.

To my fellow racial and ethnic minorities, I understand it‚Äôs hard when we take orders from those who don‚Äôt look like us nor appreciate the barriers we had to overcome to become attorneys. While ‚Äúdiversity and inclusion initiatives‚Äù are popular now, it‚Äôs clear that many firms don‚Äôt understand that it‚Äôs not parallel to elitism. If the efforts are genuine, the refusal to consider candidates from non-elitist schools hinders these initiatives. It is likewise hurt by refusing to consider candidates from non-elitist schools who were not blessed with ability to immediately succeed in their first year of law school, posting ‚Äúonly‚Äù Bs and B+s. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you scored all As the next two years, the impact of those first year grades limit how high your average can become.¬†

And even if we come from an elitist school, which is unlikely unless your family was fortunate enough to have you in good grade schools and able pay for tutors when necessary (of course, there are exceptions to this notion), we often hear the whispers ‚Äúoh, they aren‚Äôt that smart, their degree is due to affirmative action.‚Äù A few months ago, my friend, she‚Äôs black, was told that the firm already decided she would not make partner next year. Indeed, one year in advance, they told her there was nothing she can work on to be promoted. The reason ‚Äî a white female associate, with whom she graduated law school, had previously lied about her efforts on a project, essentially called her lazy. Before asking her side of the story, she was scolded and her story fell on deaf ears. In other words, she was coined the ‚Äúlazy black woman.‚Äù Of course, one year prior to when decisions are made, the white female associate was told she‚Äôs being promoted.

While I already knew the answer, I asked her if she would speak with HR. She responded ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm just happy to have a job and don‚Äôt want that to effect me.‚Äù If the roles were reversed, the white associate probably would have had a temper tantrum and perhaps cursed out a partner, without punishment. With that existing disparity, I understand why my fellow racial and ethnic minorities were more likely to have suicidal ideations. But to those persons, please don‚Äôt suffer in silence. I know certain backgrounds speak ill of psychotherapy but please give it chance. No one needs to know unless you tell them. Also, don‚Äôt be afraid to take medical leave for mental health, for which you‚Äôre protected from retaliation. I candidly believe that, eventually, things will drastically change for us.

In sum, to combat the mental health dilemma in our profession, we should make greater efforts to treat each other more respectfully and offer support to those struggling.",NYlawyer1003,110,106,0.81

After many ups and downs of law school I found myself in a relationship with a married man. He is a partner at his law firm and while I never worked there, I am a law student. 

The relationship has since ended, but he continues to carry on essentially preying on people with less power than him. We live in a southern state where adultery is technically a crime, however isn‚Äôt usually charged and is rather just used as grounds for divorce without having to wait for the 1-year separation period. 

I am taking the July Bar Exam and a lot has happened recently where part of dealing with my guilt is coming clean and apologizing for my actions. I want to tell his wife, not only for my own healing, but in the hopes that she realizes she deserves more and can find her own true happiness with someone who actually respects and cares for her. 

My concern is that if I tell her, it could backfire and they/he would report it to the bar association out of spite. 

Can people report things to the bar association about you? Is this something that could potentially land me in a character and fitness hearing? Should I let karma take the wheel and save myself instead? Saving myself just feels selfish after what I‚Äôve already done.",haydnkay,13,0,0.31

I‚Äôve noticed this being a growing trend among solo practitioners (hiring many per diem lawyers, instead of 1-2 full time lawyers). This irked me for a few reasons:

1. It‚Äôs obvious solos are doing this to avoid having to pay benefits (this is the main reason I was annoyed in the first instance).

2. It‚Äôs bad for the development of young lawyers because the model isn‚Äôt conducive to developing young associates into better lawyers.

37,42,Has anyone ever felt guilt after a win in court?,118h2vb,"I know, this sounds silly. I'm a first year family law associate at a small firm, so this could be my naivete talking here. I just litigated (and won) my first case. It was a contested relocation, and I came in late on the case to represent mom, who wanted to move. When I took her on as a client she sounded like the perfect victim so I was a bulldog against her ex. But as the case progressed, I realized she was the problem. The ex was actually reasonable, overly accommodating, made good faith efforts to communicate, and even overpaid in child support to make sure she and the kids were okay.  He's actually the type of client I'd be proud to represent in court; his focus seemed to truly be on the kids and wanting them close.

My client was impossible. She refused to compromise, was skeptical of clear good faith negotiations, and routinely ignored her ex's earnest attempts to communicate. Her reasons for wanting to relocate seemed legit on its face, but as I talked to OC and read up on motions that were filed way before the relocation was thrown in the mix, the timing of it all made me skeptical. I still fought like a dog til the end. During trial, the ex's case was entirely about his relationship with the kids. Never badmouthed my client once. His testimony confirmed my suspicions that she was the problem who routinely interfered with his parenting time. My client insisted on creating her own exhibits and they were all about how superior she was compared to her ex. I felt foolish arguing some of the points she insisted I argue. This was truly a case of ""hating your ex more than you love your kids"". 

We won and my client moved. Next was the child support matter. My client remained unreasonable in settlement negotiations. The father even offered to waive an 8k credit he was owed, and my client still fought him on tiny details. I reminded her that he'd have every right to revoke his offer, especially considering high emotions following the judge's ruling. I advised her not to take it to court, and she eventually settled. 

She's since ghosted me and ignored my attempts to collect attorney fees. I can't shake the feeling that I was played. I helped my client knock this poor man around. Other attorneys at my firm told me I'm too emotionally invested and that as Family Law attorneys, we represent our client, not the children. A win is a win and I should celebrate winning my first case and getting my client her desired outcome.

Has anyone ever felt gross about winning a case, or does it get easier as time goes on? This is only my first case, but I'm already thinking maybe I'm not cut out for Family Law. Or maybe I'd be better as a GAL.",Massive_Pride_2383,24,18,1.0

61,70,How do you lateral into another firm on the sly?,116r6pj,"I'm a junior associate just starting off. I landed a pretty good gig out of law school. Medium-sized firm that specializes in corporate law and commercial disputes; partners are all beauties. Work-life balance is sacrosanct to everyone there, so it isn't often that I'm answering emails past 6, and I can count on my fingers the amount of times a partner has asked me to do work on weekends. We're well known in the city, and our corporate clients are magnificently loaded and stubbornly loyal. It's an old money town and relationships are everything here, so once you do a few files right you're pretty much set for life.

The problem is in the pay. My salary is reasonable enough for starting off (80k before tax) but in this economy, it isn't feasible. I'm presently (happily) single; no one is working at my side to bring income into the home. Apartment rentals are absurdly expensive in this area. You're looking to pay around 2 grand a month (not including utilities and internet) at a bare minimum unless you want to languish in a cubbie hole, which I don't. Gas and groceries are expensive, and on top of the regular expenses I've got a 60k debt load from school that I've been busy trying to work down.

I'm not interested in living paycheck to paycheck for the next 3 years as I build my practice. I don't think that concern stems from a sense of entitlement either. 

My chief concern is networking to find a better job *without* raising alarms in my own firm or burning a bridge only to find out that my search was futile. Any thoughts and wisdom?

I periodically run into partners from other firms who eagerly ask whether I'm happy where I'm at. So there are always vultures swooping. The question is how to do this discreetly.",emerson44,6,9,0.83

74,89,I have something I want to get off my chest.,1143128,"I have been practicing law for about 20 years. I used to be a firm lawyer, now I work someplace that doesn‚Äôt require billable hours. Some would consider it a prestigious job, and I‚Äôm surrounded by brilliant, hard-working attorneys. 

I, however, am not hard working. I slack off at work all. the. time. I mean browsing the internet, playing games on my phone, doing pretty much anything except working. There are days, or even weeks, when I literally do nothing at all, other than answering the occasional question or attending conference calls. Now, there are periods when I‚Äôm able to motivate and get something done. And I can rally for deadlines. But I am not putting in solid days ‚Äì I‚Äôm often present but not doing my work. 

I don‚Äôt act this way because I want to. I was recently formally diagnosed with ADHD, I‚Äôm on meds and seeing a therapist, but between that and some deeply ingrained bad habits, I just often don‚Äôt work. I want to be more disciplined, I‚Äôve tried to change for decades. By now I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I‚Äôm just accepting that this is who I am. 

But here‚Äôs the insane part.  Every year I have a performance evaluation, and my managers tell me I‚Äôm doing a great job! They give me bonuses. I‚Äôm actually pretty well regarded within my specialty. I‚Äôve had a few pretty high-profile accomplishments. I get invited to speak at conferences and people from other offices call me for my advice. I used to be afraid of getting caught slacking off, but a few years back it occurred to me that if I *did* get caught, I could say, ‚Äúthis is how I‚Äôve been operating since I got here. You‚Äôve been giving me positive evaluations for years. So I must be doing something right.‚Äù And at that point I stopped being afraid of getting caught. 

But that doesn‚Äôt stop me from feeling guilty. And at the end of a day where I‚Äôve done nothing I just feel like shit. I think of myself as a person with integrity, but obviously the way I‚Äôve acted is anything but honest. 

So, I‚Äôm thinking about quitting the profession entirely. I realize now that law was not a good profession for me to go into. My brain cannot handle sitting in front of a computer for 8 hours a day. I hate the feeling of sitting at my desk, playing on my phone while wishing I was doing my work. I wish that I could just consider myself lucky, like somehow I‚Äôve put one over on everyone and landed an easy, respectable, well paying job, that lets me play endless hours of games. But I just feel like an asshole. 

Anyway, I just wanted to get that off my chest. Let the moral outrage commence.

EDIT: Hey guys, thanks for all the words of support. I‚Äôd always suspected I wasn‚Äôt the only one in this situation but the confirmation really helps. A couple details I didn‚Äôt include are that I do indeed work from home, but I make myself sit in front of the computer because I feel I must ‚Äúbe at my desk‚Äù for the most part. Also, I have the kind of job where I‚Äôm not allowed to take outside work, and I‚Äôm restricted in a lot of things that I‚Äôd like to do extracurricularly. But I‚Äôm saving up my pennies and hopefully in a few years I‚Äôll be able to do something else, like writing or maybe teaching ‚Äì or maybe in that time I‚Äôll figure out a way to be happy with my current situation so I can continue to do what I do.

I understand that paralegals are not lawyers and that in my state (MI) there are other certifications besides the bar that will determine my eligibility, but I have devoted a lot of time, money, and effort into a future in the legal profession, so I would like to know if there‚Äôs a rule in place that would prevent me becoming a fully certified lawyer based on my medical history.

I work-in house for a tech firm, and just finished a meeting with outside counsel, and, pardon my French, but ... jeezus fuckin' Christ, why is this business so broken? My skin was crawling. I could feel our money leaking out with every minute. 

I used to joke that that I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to go to a top tier school so I could get a lousy hourly job in big law. Then I went in-house and my job stopped being hourly. ""Billable hours"" weren't the only deliverable, the culture wasn't so domineering, and the hours weren't terrible. I also began to study the business a bit more, and even got exposed to some game theory (love working with math nerds).

Corporate law, as commonly practiced, has fundamentally broken incentives, and I can't figure out why it persists. Every other white collar sector I'm aware of has realized that paying people by the hour doesn't get people what they want. For the service provider, it incentivizes us to pack the hours, to do things inefficiently, and to abstain from adopting tools that could make us more efficient or effective. For clients, they're (mostly) not paying for results, but for process. 

How does this business model survive?? As part of an in-house team, my incentives are aligned with the business as a whole, and we use all sorts of technologically enablement that I didn't see while at a firm.

I work for myself though and I am lucky that I do alright (mainly taking court assignments). I like my schedule. It's very flexible, which is a huge perk to me. I also like the clout of being a lawyer and I truly enjoy helping people through the legal system. Most of what I like about my job is meeting new people and providing guidance. Sure I get some whack-o's calling me trying to sue Barack Obama for emotional distress  but even they are endearing in their own ways. Not really.

Anyway, I do regret aspects of becoming a lawyer, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from becoming one. I'd say, listen, try and minimize your debt, that's key. And there are ways to do it that I wish I would've known four years ago. But the actual practice of law I tend to enjoy. What about you?

115,135,Realizing this Area of Law is Not for Me,111nvv7,"Hey! I‚Äôm joining this community on a dummy account for a job question/vent. 

Im a recent graduate of law school, I took the July BAR exam and got barred in mid-November due to how long the BAR Association took to give me my number. I‚Äôm a prosecutor for a county misdemeanor and I‚Äôve been at my office for about four months (I was hired in October before being barred). And I‚Äôm finding out that criminal law just isn‚Äôt where my heart is. 

I went to law school hoping to do compliance work for an agency. Due to Covid, most of my agency internships got canceled but I was able to do felony level internships at county district attorneys offices and I liked the job when it was there. But now that I am with misdemeanors, it‚Äôs just clicking for me that I‚Äôm not passionate about this. I don‚Äôt feel good going to work many days. There are times where helping a victim or creating a really reasonable offer that everyone can agree on feels good, but for the most part, this population of defendants breaks my heart and I mainly feel that I could be helping out more with my skills not in this position. Furthermore, it‚Äôs burning me out beyond measure emotionally. 

Worse is that my office is critically understaffed so I‚Äôve been having to come in sick as a dog, and we have such a huge backlog that I‚Äôm not just being pushed in the deep end, I feel like I‚Äôm being held underwater. I can‚Äôt really be mentored or taught even though my office tries because everyone is so busy. I spend damn near 7 hours a day in court and I‚Äôm in court every day, so I have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù every moment of every day and it‚Äôs exhausting. This job feels mainly like people skills, which are great to sharpen, but I‚Äôd like more than this. 

My goal was to stay here one year, get a trial or two under my belt and then leave. I don‚Äôt know if I can wait that long. There‚Äôs a job with an agency that sounds like my dream. I‚Äôd love to apply for it, but I‚Äôm not even six months in, and I feel like I should chip away an extra month because that first month I wasn‚Äôt much help. I don‚Äôt want to abandon my office. They‚Äôre good people, I like them a lot, it‚Äôs just the job that‚Äôs not for me. 

 I‚Äôm exhausted and burnt out and frightened I‚Äôm going to have to do my first trial alone when I was told when I first started that wouldn‚Äôt be the case, but we‚Äôre running so thin that there‚Äôs no way two of us could be out for a trial ‚Äî we can barely handle one.  I don‚Äôt know if I give a shit about waiting to do a trial anymore anyway. I‚Äôm just wanting to move onto a different area of career but I feel like it‚Äôs too soon. 

I tell my family that I‚Äôm thinking about leaving and they blow a gasket that I‚Äôd leave before a year. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll last the year though considering how fried I feel. But at the same time I don‚Äôt want to shoot myself in the foot for any future jobs by leaving too soon. This position, we‚Äôre not that large of a legal community ‚Äî I‚Äôve been doing as honest and good of work as I can while I‚Äôve been here but I don‚Äôt want to blow my reputation by being a ‚Äúflake‚Äù.

120,141,Returning to MBB before law career?,1117hi8,"Hi everyone! TIA for any and all advice. I‚Äôm currently an analyst at an MBB consulting firm and am planning to apply for law school this fall. 

There have been some good parts of consulting, but I am ultimately not very passionate about consulting or business in general and have wanted to be a litigator my whole life. I‚Äôve always had a strong passion for trial law (e.g college mock trial, past classes), but got a little too caught up in the consulting recruiting craze at my college and am now looking to return to my initial goal of law.

At my firm, analysts have the option to have JD/MBA degrees or JDs partially paid for (JDs without the MBA with special approval only). I am still trying to navigate the exact rules and whether I should get a JD/MBA or just JD (if I‚Äôm not able to get the JD-only approval, the JD/MBA may actually end up cheaper). In order to have my law degree partially paid for, I‚Äôll need to return to my consulting firm for at least 2 years after law school graduation. 

My question overall is whether returning to MBB for 2 years after law school will ruin my chances to transition into a law career after those 2 years, ideally at a midsize or small law firm. My ultimate goal is to work for the DOJ and I don‚Äôt mind if it takes me a while to get there, but I want to make sure I don‚Äôt ruin my chances at a law career and the DOJ by returning to MBB first.

The other option I am considering post law school is to go in to Biglaw for a few years to pay down my debts. I would heavily prefer to go back to MBB for a few reasons-1) Given I have worked there for 3 years, I am familiar with the work and culture; 2) Even though biglaw salaries are slightly higher, MBB would help me pay my loans faster given they‚Äôd pay for 1/3 to 1/2 of my JD (or JD/MBA) in addition to a salary that would still be quite good; 3) Even though my time in MBB has been brutal hours-wise (a couple of all nighters, a few 18-20 hour straight work days), it still seems way better than Biglaw (I have never had to work a weekend, holiday, or vacation day and some cases are only like 50 hrs a week); 4) While I believe my dream job is law and I‚Äôm going to love it, I know a lot of people hate it, and going back to MBB for those 2 years after law school would allow me to more easily transition back to the business world in the event that I end up disliking law (unlikely, but I am extremely risk averse).

One final piece is that if I return to MBB first, I could potentially try to do a rotation/be an assistant to our in-house counsel division. However, I haven‚Äôt discussed this with my firm yet so I have no idea if it would be allowed. I also don‚Äôt know how helpful it would be given I want to do litigation rather than corporate law and it wouldn‚Äôt be anything like BL training, but it could help me do a little bit of law work during my 2 years at MBB.  

As evidenced above, I would really prefer to go back to MBB for 2 years rather than Biglaw, but I am worried that doing so could make me unable to find a law job afterwards. I‚Äôm open to small firms, midsize firms, DA‚Äôs offices, clerking, etc. so am not too picky with law jobs, as long as they‚Äôre solid enough to eventually get me to the DOJ long-term. 

Would going back to MBB for 2 years ruin my chances to get a job in law? Would the answer change if I stayed at MBB for 3 years instead since salary spikes in year 3? I plan to do my internships in law and even heard of a girl in my same position at my firm push her law offer 2 years to go back to MBB first, but her offer was in transactional BL whereas I‚Äôd look for jobs in midsize litigation most likely (or DA‚Äôs offices) which I could see being different.

Additionally, I‚Äôve heard that BL gives a great legal training foundation for those wanting to go into the DOJ-would I be able to get a solid training program in a midsize or small firm, or is it expected that most people at those firms start in BL first?

I have everything set up at the second-floor office as I have been there for four years.  
The downside of the second-floor office is no signage, lack of stairs, and it‚Äôs not very visible. 

My lease is ending in March. I received notice from my landlord that either I can sign a new lease for two years, or if I hold over, there will be a 200% penalty on the rent payment for each day I stay without a signed lease.

Looking around, I don‚Äôt really like the building I‚Äôm in, but it is a very good location, easily accessible from the freeway.

There is an office available downstairs in the same building, but it is double the rent at $1850. It has three separate offices, a reception, desk, a sign on the building, and is on the ground floor. 

As everybody knows, money is tight for everyone these days and I‚Äôm very nervous about signing a two year lease at double the rent amount. Should I just let go of the office entirely and simply meet clients at their homes? Am I stressing too much about the increase?

137,167,2L FREAKING OUT about future C+F Application,10yfpxg,"Hi everyone, throwaway account. I am literally like freaking out writing this right now. I'm a 2L and plan on applying for admission in NY. I'll cut to the chase. Last year, literally at the very beginning of my 1L year, I was with a friend who got an AmEx credit card. I decided to apply for one on of my own and have had multiple other CCs (not with AmEx) before. The issue is I put down an income that is WAY higher than I made at the time in an attempt to get approve because I heard that you should use what you would reasonably expect to make if you didn't already have that income. Thinking I'm about to start law school and be a lawyer eventually, I'll put a pretty nice salary. They ended up asking me for some form of verification, but figuring that since it's something I couldn't really prove since it was just speculation, I didn't provide anything and they just denied the application about a day later or something.

I didn't really think anything of this until I saw something saying you can use projected income if it's within A YEAR or so of when you will reasonably make it. Now obviously at the time in early 1L I could not reasonably expect to make that kind of money within 1 year. Like I said I have a few other credit cards but never put a salary like that when I applied for them. *Edit to say that I have had carried credit card debt in the past, but have never missed a minimum payment/defaulted on any account and currently have a 750 score and no longer carry any CC debt and pay off cards in full at the end of the month.*

I'm now reading up on all of this credit fraud stuff and obviously that's scaring me but I'm also SUPER worried about Character and Fitness. I will be in a lot of debt due to law school and now it started to weigh on me that I could possibly get denied admission and literally never be a lawyer after all of this time and money. AmEx denied the application at the time and according to their website I seemed to have applied to them again another time last year, but I do not believe I used a salary like the one I used in the earlier application, that one was also denied. They have never reached out to me about it (nor has anyone else) and as of now no legal action has been taken against me. As I started to freak out about this I went and obtained my official credit report from all three major credit bureaus and it looks like the credit application will fall off my credit report by next Fall, about a year before I'd be doing the C+F application. I know that there are C+F attorneys and such but I am just so badly freaking out about this right now and am just so angry at myself for making such a dumb mistake that could literally ruin my career and future. What the hell do I do? From my research after learning about this it looks like it's pretty rare for people to get in legal trouble and usually they just deny your application and legal troubles usually happen if someone tries to declare bankruptcy and was given credit based on their incorrect income. Is this something that I should leave alone? Should I contact AmEx about it now even though it's been a long time? Is this something that if left alone C+F like investigates into (I am aware they look at credit generally but don't know if they go and take a look at every credit application you've ever submitted) I am so sorry for this long post but this is literally keeping me awake right now I am sick to my stomach.",Apart_Movie6834,34,1,0.5

Not limited to dull navy, gray or black. Granted i still wear those colors, but today I wore an emerald green velvet jacket (something Prince might have worn) over a black dress. I'll wear the purple one tomorrow. 

Shoes. I don't limit myself to dress shoes anymore, which for women, mean flats or heels. Today i wore a pair of light green canvas plimsolls. I also wear birkenstock clogs too. 

Nylons ONLY when it's cold, meaning below 45 degrees. Otherwise it's bare legs when i wear a dress or skirt. 

Clients get fired the minute they are rude to me or my secretary. They get fired if they work against my advice, then try to blame me for their own idiocy. I didn't have this option 5 years ago, but i do now. And as long as i have this option, that's how it will be. 

I no longer care about ""looking stupid"" or asking ""stupid questions"" in front of other attorneys or judges. If i don't know, then i don't know. And i ask anyway.  at the end of the day, all that matters is that my client has the right info, whether it's from me or someone else including opposing counsel. 

I no longer participate in professional associations. I was a treasurer of two of them and presented at the seminars. Then a mixture of association infighting, and my own personal/professional crisis happened, and I resigned a year ago. I give too much of myself already to this profession, and I'm NOT doing it in my spare time. 

I personally help younger, exploited attorneys whenever possible even when they are being their young, unconfident, overly competitive selves. I get it, i was that young attorney once too.

155,190,Should I leave the law?,10xd1wo,"Sorry for the long note. Background - I went to law school and graduated in 2013.  I started out in a Big Law firm and moved over the years to a fairly decent in-house role.  It's well paid and stable and has been really interesting in more recent years. I am in my 30s now.  I definitely got to a point during law firm days in my 20s where I was constantly burnt out and stressed and hated everything about law and fantasized about leaving all the time.

In-house has been better but it is still stressful in a different way as I am quite senior and I do work around the clock a lot.  I am definitely still feeling burnt out, have very little time to myself and have become rather sedentary and unhealthy from the workload and expectations.

Over the last five years, I developed new interests and goals for myself outside of law and decided I wanted to change career completely. I took some preliminary steps towards making that happen such as taking some classes but never took the step of leaving my career altogether.  My dream for the last five years was to go back to grad school one day and facilitate a full career change to something more interesting and meaningful to me.

I now have an offer from one of the world's leading schools to do my MS and the funds to be able to take a year off to do that. It feels exhilarating to think about doing that and I have actually accepted the offer but I am having some serious second thoughts. Not because I don't want to do my MS - that's my dream. But it means saying goodbye to my whole career and life in the law and it feels quite scary doing that when I have been in it for a decade and progressed - particularly as that will happen in just six months or so.  Money is a huge thing that I am having a very hard time getting past - I am fortunate to earn six figures after working my way up. To leave that to ""follow my dream"" feels obnoxious almost given all the layoffs taking place. 

I also feel like I am the only one I know in law taking this path - all of my friends are lawyers and committed to making partner or GC one day, which is something is already starting to happen in my friendship age group.  I guess I am kind of grieving my career already.

I am worried about not making money when I finish the course, worried about tanking a career I've spent a decade building and worried that going back to school is just objectively a bad thing to do in your 30s during peak earning and progression years.  I'd be starting out a whole new career in my 30s when everything about law is so familiar. But the truth is that I have mostly been miserable in law from day one. I hate the constant stressing and cleaning up of messes. In-house is okay but it can be even worse than a firm at times - the difficult stakeholders, the blame culture, the total chaos, the politics, the time zones, the very different pressures, the strategy stuff.

I feel like I would really regret not taking this planned pause and pursuing my dream, but it feels really weird doing it at this age and time in my career. I also want to use the year to not just complete my MS, but to take some time to myself, get into healthier routines again and get my mind and body to a good place. They've both taken a beating over the last decade and I want to get back to who I was and maybe travel to a few places too and see family more.

158,193,Can't stop making mistakes. Need to vent to fellow lawyers.,10wsinw,"Hey all, I've been lurking here for awhile and finally decided to post.  I'd like to get all your input on a problem I've been having for the past few months.  I don't really know what I'm looking for by posting this.  I'm in the midst of a panic attack and I just want to vent and see what you guys think.

To give you my background, I was admitted to the bar back in July 2018 and was hired by a small personal injury firm a few months later.  For the first year or so working at the firm I was relegated to churning out demand letters, client intake, etc.  Basically, paralegal work.  By year two I was doing one mediation every few months and had one arbitration in total.  Almost my entire job was filing volumes of boiler plate complaints and summons and then non-suiting them when the matters settled.  By the end of year three I had taken one deposition, worked on one trial and been involved in one discovery dispute.  Neither I nor the other associate were allowed to negotiate settlements with opposing counsel using any other tactic than simply exchanging numbers.

What I'm trying to say I don't feel like this job prepared me to be an attorney.  I felt like I barely knew more than when I left law school and, honestly, it made me feel insecure when I would talk to associates at other firms.   I received nothing but praise from my boss regarding my performance, but that didn't help much.

Anyway, it was in my third year that I and the one other associate at the firm decided to quit.  Our rationale was (1) we were glorified paralegals and there was no upward mobility at the firm and (2) our boss--the lead attorney--had become extremely toxic (e.g., he told me that going to the bathroom 15 minutes after arriving at the office was ""stealing from the firm,"" because I should have just gone before I left home).

I was unemployed for a few months after that.  I did some traveling, and then landed at another firm that did covered basically every subject area: wills, corporate contracts, personal injury, civil rights, etc.  There were three partners at the firm and each one had assigned me tasks, and I was expected to bring on clients of my own.  I was fired two months in, but still got some decent work experience under my belt while I was there.  I don't know exactly why I was fired.  I was told my billable hours, work performance and everything was unobjectionable, but that I ""wasn't a good fit.""  I can get more into this if you guys want.

After that, I was unemployed until March 2022, at which point I was hired by a solo practitioner who specializes in real estate law, with an emphasis on landlord-tenant law.  During my interview, I explained that I had little to no litigation experience, no substantial, practical, post-graduate experience in *any* legal subject except personal injury, and would require extensive tutelage.  Mind you, I did not state this in a self-pitying manner.  I just wanted to temper expectations.

This is where I currently work, as the sole associate working under a single lawyer.  It has been rocky to say the least.  The problem, to put it simply, is there are so many things I don't know I don't know.

For example, in my state eviction notices have to state the move-out date.  For 14-day eviction notices, 3-day eviction notices and 60-day evictions notices determining the move-out date is simple: it's the last day of the notice period.  However, for 120-day notices, the move-out date is the notice period *plus the remaining days until the next rental period* (i.e., the next month).  This means, if 120 days out from the date of service is March 28th, the move-out date must be plugged in as March 31st.  My boss had me knock out the other types of notices for a few months and then about four months ago told me to do some 120-day notices.  The notices don't cite to the statute and it just didn't occur to me to dig into the law to verify that ""120-days"" means ""120-days.""  My boss didn't have me research for the other notices, he just gave me exemplars and told me to work off those.  I just assumed, and plugged in wrong move-out dates.  Now, four months later, none of the notices are valid and he's pissed.  The worst part is about a couple months ago he told me this about how 120-day notices work (completely unrelated to the prior mentioned work) and I forgot to resend the notices with proper move out dates.  I should've remembered, but it fell between the cracks I guess.

There's been other stuff as well, I left the judgment amount in a default judgment summary blank, because I swear I saw that in an exemplar, and a judge left it blank, so I have to get the judgment amended (the error that prompted to make this post).  I've misstyped case numbers in captions incorrectly on more than one occasion.  I missed a deadline to apply for costs as a prevailing party in my first appeal from a court of limited jurisdiction, thankfully per the rules it's a very soft deadline, but still.  I had a corporate client send me a notice to evict a post-foreclosure occupant, but they got the name of the occupant wrong and I didn't verify that with the auditor before drafting and sending out a complaint based on it.  I used an exemplar complaint for an individual plaintiff as my template for all my complaints--be they individual plaintiffs or LLCs--meaning for the LLC Plaintiffs the line about how the LLC is valid is absent.

These are just the big ones.  I feel like I can't go a single day without making some sort of error or leaving a typo in a document and no matter how much I re-read my documents I can't catch them.

My boss said that my problem is I'm not ""intellectually curious,"" and that If I was these errors would not have happened, and that each error ""chips away"" at his reputation.  He said that his practice area is narrow and he doesn't understand how I don't get it.  He's right, it is narrow, but it's still complicated! There are a lot of moving parts and the rules are different not just county-by-county and city-by-city.  I don't think my boss is going to accept ""I've never done this before"" as an excuse for much longer, and that certainly won't fly with any of the clients.  Given the sheer volume of my and my bosses workload it is not practical for him to review everything I do, and I'm afraid If I ask him to do that he'll start to see me more as a liability than anything else and fire me.

I will say this, once I learn something is a mistake I don't do it again.  And these are not mistakes made in the face of instructions to do the contrary.   My boss also said I'm an excellent persuasive writer and legal researcher.  For what it's worth.

It's just stuff trips me up, or I don't know I don't know things.  I fell like I'm an okay attorney overall but I'm so inexperienced and so non-detail oriented it seems like that I've started seriously considering changing careers.  I'm four years in and still feel like a first year, in terms of competency and knowledge.  I don't think I'm cut out for this.

I'll cut this short and end here.  It's 1:30am and I have to be up in six hours.  Plus this is long enough as is.

I am looking for opinions on not job-hunting during the clerkship, ending in August, and being intentionally jobless for 4-5 months until beginning to look again in January.

There are a couple reasons I would want to do this. By the end of this clerkship, I will have worked 3 years since law school without really any break (started first job (state agency) a week after the bar exam, then was required to start this clerkship without any break after ending first job). I am getting married in late August and want to do a honeymoon, which would account for a couple weeks. But mostly I have some other life projects I would love to focus on for a couple months, I do painting and had recently started getting into exhibitions and shows before starting this clerkship, which pretty much killed my free time. I don‚Äôt intend to paint full time or anything but it would be great to give that some attention for awhile.

Worth mentioning also that I have decent savings and that my fiancee would be working, which would provide health insurance. Also this could be a time to really look at next jobs and not rush into it. I have been pretty swamped so haven‚Äôt really been job hunting as much as my fellow clerks.

What do you think? Would this be a red flag that would set me back, or would this be a non-issue? I feel like I would be a competitive applicant coming from this clerkship even with a resume gap, but maybe I‚Äôm being naive. I want to do litigation in a small or mid sized firm, no big law.

I currently work as a law clerk in a ruralish superior court circuit. I have greatly enjoyed my time here, and I feel like I'm making a difference in my hometown.

For context, I plugged in 170 hours of billing total (billable and non billable) for this month‚Äôs round. I kept asking for work from seniors to show that I am eager. I don‚Äôt know how many hours exactly went to administrative like billing, but I had to do a great deal more than had I known the system.

Then I was given her mugshot...that's kinda eye opening for the first day. We also keep our door locked mostly bc of her. When I asked my bosses if there was potential for an active shooter situation (I'm up front at the reception desk) they didn't seem worried and told me it happens a lot. In this case the woman is mentally ill and her counsel and parenting coordinator (a former prison psychologist) have also dropped her.

Well it's been three weeks and it's been quiet on my end,  but I spent all day organizing a binder of evidence for a hearing they have against her for custody on Monday. In the Binder are 16 emails of her harrassing and threatening my boss, basically saying she hopes she dies and she gets what's coming to her, etc.

In text messages between her and her kids, when she's accused of saying she's going to shoot people, she dismisses it saying that it's silly because she doesn't have access to a gun...that wasn't the response I was hoping for.

Anyways, I'm terrified. I'm afraid this hearing on Monday will set her off - there's a chance she'll lose custody of her kids and she'll come into the office for revenge. And there's me, all by myself in the front.

(My boss instructs me not to subpoena these police reports, because my boss is certain the judge will deny the request.)

But I learned something today. The party that filed the police reports just filed a completely unrelated lawsuit pro se, and sort of mentioned the police reports in court documents.   The wording says: ""\[The party\] was forced to press charges agains the assailant, who lived LOCATION on DATE, after a physical assault  by the assailant.""

I know what both police reports say but don't have copies.

Nobody ""pressed charges."" The party in question, who is prone to exaggeration, filed a police report for a physical assault in which he received a scratch. A few days later he filed another report where there was a shouting match in the lobby.

I want to guide my client on how to request an appeal from the police department.

202,245,"Lawyers in small practices, how do you get healthcare, what is the quality of it, and how much do you pay for it?",10rwp5a,"I've been looking into it and it seems like exchange plans for individuals/single families are more expensive across the board than group plans that big corporations can get their employees. I've been thinking about using a stipend for potential employees to buy healthcare on the exchange, but that would be an extra $10k-$50k per employee expense based on if the employee had a family or not, and the size of the family, to get good healthcare on the exchange. 

Is there anyway for small businesses such as a law practice with one lawyer and one employee to get access to the cheaper/better plans that corporations and the like have access to? I assume they get better rates since they have huge account sizes? There must be some sort of collective that small businesses can join to get comparable rates and quality of healthcare?

I was hired by a big law firm around a year ago. I remember during the interview that I was asked if I wanted to go to law school and I said that I wasn't really sure. I took the LSAT 4 times and did well but I had also been working at a small firm that I hated. I was taken advantage of, had money, stole from me, and was treating like garbage by many attorneys. It really put me off the idea of going to study law and I thought that I would put off applying. However, my new firm was amazing and I truly loved it and it helped bring back the spark and confirm that law is the path I want to take.

I applied to several schools and got scholarship offers to a number of top 10 schools, which I'm super thankful for. Most schools start in August. I haven't told my job that I've applied to schools, let alone has been accepted. I'm just afraid they will fire me on the spot for doing so despite not being given any reason to believe that they would do so. I plan on giving them over 30 days notice so they can find a replacement and to alleviate the burden of me leaving. I just don't know what to tell them when they ask why I'm leaving. I thought about making some excuse like, ""I really just want to move"" or something but I just don't know.

The median billable rate for a solo practitioner with their own office is $250, yet the gross income of the same group is just $144,500. With two weeks of vacation a year, that means they're billing just 2.41 hours per workday on average. 

I know in big law and stuff you'll be able to bill as many hours and do as much work as you want. However, I have no desire to bill 8+ hours a day long term, but billing <3 hours per day seems like the opposite extreme. Do solo practitioners even tend to have a billing structure that often? I guess I'm concerned that this is a marketing/workflow issue rather than a deliberate choice by the lawyers to work less. If I went to an average law school could I realistically bill 4-6 hours per day as a solo practitioner with a median billable rate? I'd love to hear some knowledge from people who know about this sort of thing, thanks.

219,266,6 months into first legal aid job and on the verge of a breakdown,10qym26,"TW: self harm, mental illness, etc.

Hi everyone, sorry for bleakposting in advance. I graduated in 2022, passed the bar, and I am currently working my first post-grad job as a housing attorney for a legal aid organization. I [posted here a few months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawyertalk/comments/xmjlvs/how_to_thrive_in_chaotic_public_interest_office/) about how bad things are in my office, and I really appreciate everyone's kind and honest feedback.

Long story short: my boss is completely absent -- I hear from her maybe 1-2x a week w/ critiques on something I did days prior. When I started I was 1 of 4 attorneys on my team, and all of them have now left due to toxic working conditions. There is no mentorship, no guidance, and I have 40+ cases assigned to me and I am still not even licensed. I feel completely alone and responsible for so many families on the brink of homelessness with literally no one to turn to (and yes I try to call/text/email my boss constantly; yes people have brought her failings to her attention in the past and she just does not care).

It's just now hitting me how bad things have gotten. I have nightmares about this job. My body is riddled with aches and pains. I feel myself turning to weed and alcohol to cope with the stress more nights than not. I wake up every morning dreading sitting at my desk and increasingly spend my days distracted and dissociating, not even caring about the work. I feel withdrawn from my friends and loved ones and activities and hobbies I love. Even doing the bare minimum at work, I still feel like this job is slowly but surely chipping away at my will to live. I absolutely cannot keep doing this job or I am worried I will have an actual breakdown.

I have been applying for other jobs, but the fact that I am still not licensed I am sure is not helping my case. I am also feeling so much shame and doubt questioning whether I even want to do this work. How much of a failure will I feel like if I just gave myself $150K in student debt, 3 years of law school, just to seek out another job less than a year after I graduated?

I am not sure what I even want to get out of this post. Part of me wants to just vent and get what I've been feeling out into the world. Part of me wants to hear if other people have experienced similar feelings and how they overcame them. Part of me wants to know that I am not a failure if I decide to take my career in a different direction.

Im struggling cuz I have a pretty sweet gig as-is. I‚Äôm kinda scared about the long hours and maybe suffer from a bit from imposter syndrome.

I kinda like having a life but can‚Äôt help but think I‚Äôm holding myself back by sticking with what‚Äôs comfortable. 

I have struggled for a week and can‚Äôt decide. My gut says to stay where I‚Äôm at. But I‚Äôm worried my gut is just anxious and lazy.

Thank you for reading my stream of conscientiousness. Any wisdom you have is greatly appreciated.

239,291,My boss recorded our conversations,10oougm,"I just left my firm after a few years as things really went downhill and became toxic over the last six months. Most notably, my (now former) boss installed a lot of cameras. For example, he had cameras everywhere, including facing the bathroom doors so he could see how long employees were in there. And it quickly became apparent that these cameras have microphones on them and he could hear office conversations through them. This was then confirmed by the office manager. 

He began calling employees into his office and accusing them of being disloyal or dishonest with him based on a conversation that he listened to through the cameras. I soon began to suspect that he had recording devices elsewhere, but I don‚Äôt have confirmation of that. I do know he recorded all phone calls, as the office manager was tasked with listening to these phone calls and the conversations that she could hear through the cameras and that‚Äôs what she spent most of her day doing. 

I‚Äôm out now but I feel really icky about the whole thing. My state is a one party consent state, but he was never a part of any of these conversations. He recorded and listened to conversations between other people. Illegally recording someone without their knowledge or consent is a felony in my state, but my former boss personally knows the DA. His reputation with the local bar has definitely deteriorated in the last six months, but I still worry nothing would be done and that I would risk my professional reputation more than his.",hungriehungriehippie,40,79,0.97
240,292,Career Advice for a Part-Time Law Student and Full-Time Gov't Employee,10ofrr3,"Hello currently practicing legal professionals. I am seeking your opinions on a career decision that I am quite hung up on right now.

**Question:** Should I leave my legal-adjacent position working for the federal government to become an attorney after passing the bar?

**Background:** I am a part-time law student in my final semester at a T50 school. I was on law review and am in the top 1/3 of my class for grades. I'm 31 and I attended law school on a part-time basis so that I could continue working in my full-time job as a Program Analyst for a federal agency during law school. During law school I continued to get promotions/pay raises in that position and I'm now nearing the end of law school with little debt and a job that pays a bit over $100k. I like my current position and coworkers. The work is non-legal but legal-adjacent. I work on policy matters and get to use my legal research and writing skills for advocate for policy positions or work on legislative proposals.

I'm scared of the possibility that leaving this position might mean a lower salary in the short-term, more difficulty to build my skills as an attorney and some risk that I end up in a less-fulfilling role with less enjoyable coworkers. However, I've also loved my law school classes and think I would feel a lot of fulfillment from practicing law.

So in sum, I like the position that I'm in now a lot, but I fear that I'm making a big mistake by not practicing after completing law school and passing the bar.

I feel like I have three options -- (1) pivot out of gov't into practicing law ASAP, (2) stay in my current position and continue my non-legal career or (3) try to mix the two by continuing my current role while seeking out opportunities to either practice law within the federal government or take on more legal responsibilities.

I would appreciate any advice or opinions that the practicing attorneys on this subreddit have to share. Thanks!

EDIT: Thank you to everyone that provided their input. This was hugely helpful. I think I'm going to stick with Plan #3 while networking and keeping my ear to the ground for positions at boutique firms in practice areas that I like.

I'm trying to find centralized data so I can figure out where I'd get the most bang for my buck being a lawyer. The BLS has some data on 'location quotient', which compares how relatively common lawyers are, but it's just part of the picture. I've also used Clio data and compared that to cost of living per state, but all of these are meh workarounds compared to simply having access to median income data. I know means tend to be higher than medians, but it seems kind of risky to extrapolate from mean data, especially given how bifurcated lawyer income is, or to extrapolate form one state to another based on cost of living.

Background information: Current 3L having my last semester in a middle ranked law school in NYC. I was a transactional paralegal for 9 years before law school. I have been working with a real estate law firm since 2L. No post graduate position offered yet.

This real estate law firm offered post graduate position to all the summer associates in the litigation department and put all of us in transactions department as pending. I am still working with them during my last semester but they made it clear that it doesn't mean thay they will offer me, because under this economy, the firm does not know its need for additional associates. Decision will be made in March.

I understand that I should apply for other firms instead of waiting for March to come. Many law school classmates told me I shouldn't be worried because of my legal experience, but I'm very worried now. Most associate job postings are asking for 3-5 experience which I don't have, and all of them are for immediate hire which I won't be available to work full time until after bar exam.

My questions are 1) whether it is appropriate for me to apply to a position that requires some experience? 2) Is there better platforms/recruiters for me to look for firms that are interested in hiring new associate in August/September instead of immediate hire? 3) Does cold emailing law firms appropriate and/or effective?

I finished it, I was super super focused on the meat being correct that I honestly messed up little stuff and despite my boss correcting it on a redline version- accidentally left his signature instead of changing it to mine.

To summarize, she was a paralegal for a immigration firm up until very recently for about a month leading up to now that did some very morally questionable stuff and she's anxious that these things may be commonplace in the US legal profession. 

My girlfriend found evidence while working there that they would put their clients on payment plans and then weeks before their hearing he would demand the remainder of all the payments, if they didn't pay he would file a motion to withdraw under the guise of ""they have not contacted me in X months/years"" when in some cases they had literally talked days ago. He would also call his clients ""fucking bitch"" etc. in the mass FB Messenger group the firm used to communicate. She also found some instances of judges calling him out on these motions to withdraw and that they were no longer taking cases for clients that had those judges. 

He also would ""hire"" paralegals asking them to come on site (usually to his own house at first) but not negotiate exact pay or have any employment documents signed for several days, and if someone hired in this manner just stopped showing up (which due to how shady this is, they frequently did) he would just never pay them. Although in many cases paralegals were just asked to not come back after a few days to a week, all in all leading to them burning through 6-7 paralegals a month.

There appear to be a number of ""mastermind"" groups for different types of practice areas, but I have not encountered one dealing with federal litigation in general. Also, the idea of sharing fact patterns with a group, rather than a trusted colleague, seems fraught with potential ethical issues.

279,346,Combating burn out,10l0nru,"I‚Äôve been practicing less than 2 years at a boutique litigation firm and I think I am suffering from burn out. I am constantly swamped with work which is negatively affecting my ability to stay on top of deadlines and put the hours necessary into work that I do complete because I‚Äôm always playing catch up. I‚Äôve always been the associate that is more than willing to take on new work and take pride in my work. I believe this has lead to some of my managing partners to believe that my skill level is higher than it is and so they just keep assigning work to me. I love being a person people feel confident assigning work to, but I am afraid that I‚Äôm entering a slow decline in my work product will eventually lead to partners not wanting to assign work to me anymore.

Does anyone have any advice for combating burnout and how to approach partners about it?

I am an Articling Student, just finished law school. In my previous jobs in business I would take a 10 minute walking break in the morning when I got a few tasks done. In the afternoon I would take another 10 minute walking break. For lunch I would just eat and work.

My question is now that I work in a Law office, when can I take walking breaks outside? I know there are tasks that have to be completed and I do so, however it seems no one leaves the office unless they have to see a client. In my current firm no one goes out for fresh air and the only breaks they take is to go to the bathroom. Is this normal? I just can‚Äôt sit down for 8 hours a day and no walking at all.

First she said the pain returned in June and was gone at her last appt in March 2022. I asked if the doctor made a mistake recommending further injections and chiro (after was discharged in Jan. 2022)? Then she said she‚Äôs still planning to go back for treatment, saying she‚Äôs still in pain this whole time. 

I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this means a) the pain isn‚Äôt really that bad since she never sought treatment again since then or b) is it her fault if she‚Äôs in pain now and not the accident because she failed to follow the doctor‚Äôs advice?

Further, would it make sense and build her case if after all this time she suddenly goes back for treatment or it shows lack of credibility? It was like a really light sideswipe where the plaintiff driver before her depo said at his depo it was at 5 mph. 

Any insights appreciated. I was trying to take the angle if she‚Äôs waited so long maybe it‚Äôs not so bad but after the depo I‚Äôm left feeling like I emphasized a lot about the further recommendations her doctor made, and when her lawyer didn‚Äôt redirect it made me feel like I helped their case.

290,358,Quitting after 7 years,10k8u8m,"After working as an aviation power plant machinist in the army, I took my English degree and went to law school on the GI bill. What else was I going to do?

I hated law school. So I graduated as quickly as possible, 2.5 years. 18 credits a semester while working for the DA‚Äôs office each semester since 2L. The stress of everything was so terrible, I would drink until I passed out. In the morning, I‚Äôd wake up, drive to the courthouse and litigate for four hours, go to law school until 8pm - didn‚Äôt pay attention, just studied for finals every second I decided to attend - go home, rinse and repeat.

I passed the bar and moved back to my hometown (top 4 largest cities in the US). There, I worked in the DA‚Äôs office for 64k per year, handling a cattle call of about 400 defendants twice a week. Two days a week were nothing but trials lasting 1-4 hours each. One day I worked in the office, prepping for upcoming cases. I made about $30 million per year on settlements and civil convictions for this office of the state, on that salary. The good thing is that as an attorney in the public sector, the loans I took out are being paid back. Having said all this, I loved that job. But I wanted to win everything, so I stressed myself to the max and continued to booze to my detriment.

Fast forward three years. Now I‚Äôm married with a mortgage and two kids. I get a call from my city‚Äôs fire and police department. I‚Äôm invited to enter the fire academy after I took the civil service exam during my first semester of law school. I completely forgot I took the test. Most likely, I was hungover. 

So I quit my job at the DA, got on the FD full time, 60 hours per week for double the money I made as a govt attorney, and started working on my off days as a family law attorney for a small firm with a great boss.

Family law practice in my state is a great place for private sector attorneys to cut their teeth. The rules are lax, and essentially every evidentiary hearing comes down to ‚Äútotality of the circumstances.‚Äù If we have the facts, I counsel my clients to proceed. If we don‚Äôt, settle for the best. Don‚Äôt jag them around for more money and the humiliation of looking like a total asshole in open court.

After four years of the above, my clients wore me down. All of them have unreasonable expectations and hear what they want, not what I‚Äôve told them. Additionally, I‚Äôve been moonlighting as a civil rights attorney for a national law firm. And I took a very part time position as a transactional attorney. Now, because I‚Äôve been so busy with two careers, a family, and general personal responsibilities, my reaching for the bottle is non existent. This doesn‚Äôt do any favors on my stress.

About two weeks ago I was floored with stomach pain. after several tests, I was told that, most likely, due to stress and alcohol, I have several perforated ulcers in my stomach and esophagus and need surgery. I recently was placed on paid leave from the fire dept, and I quit practicing law for an indefinite period.

I don‚Äôt know what the point of this rant is. But I read a lot of helpful stories on Reddit. As I sit hear waiting for biopsy results, I can honestly say that it‚Äôs been a blessing. I love being a firefighter, and although I‚Äôm a decent trial attorney, I hate the profession.

I suppose the moral is, if you‚Äôve given the practice a shot and didn‚Äôt quit after it got difficult, AND you still hate it - quit. It‚Äôs not worth your health. It‚Äôs not entirely a sunken cost. There‚Äôs more to life than often unappreciated work.",No_Address6707,25,96,0.97

Initially I thought I just disliked personal injury cases, but after switching to mostly employment, I've realized that I hate litigation. I need to make a change. 

Prior to law school, I was a small business owner that did IT work for other small businesses. I would set up networks, phone systems, cameras, and CCTV, by both installing all the hardware/cabling and configuring the software. I also more recently found that data privacy and cybersecurity legal concepts are fascinating to me.

I obtained my CIPP/US cert and am currently looking for anything else that can make me more attractive on paper for these positions. Ideally, I'd love to get a privacy role at a firm or corporation, but its looking like its not in the cards for me and its so frustrating.

Initially I gave him examples of a few sites I like, but he never asked any background questions about ideal client/ who we are targeting, what our traffic is like, etc. With each draft, I‚Äôve had to spend so much time laying out and explaining exactly what I want visually, giving examples of other sites I like for each page, building my own site map, writing all of the content‚Ä¶I am an attorney, not a marketing expert.

I started learning more about website performance, what matters, etc. I ran core vitals check/ Lighthouse report on his other sites and they‚Äôre all very slow and failing on performance. He tells me speed doesn‚Äôt matter?

I‚Äôm not looking for something over the top here. Just a solid Wordpress website foundation that I can easily refresh down the road without rebuilding and the ability to easily add content myself. And built by someone who understands Google best practices and technical SEO.

324,398,Reference Possibility of Reciprocity on Resume?,10hrmce,"Hey reddit,

Found a job I'd like to apply for. Besides needing to be barred in my current jurisdiction (State A), they want applicants to be barred in another state I am not (State B).

There is reciprocity between State A and B after you've practiced for X years; it's simply a motion for admission with a few procedural requirements. I am eligible for this reciprocity later this year. 

Should I reference this on my resume somehow? I added a clause at the end of my cover letter alluding to this, but they may not even get that far if they only see State A on the resume. I understand that maybe they need someone for State B immediately, but if I am a good applicant otherwise, perhaps they'd be willing to consider me knowing I can do that work soon. 

Alternatively, maybe it'll be obvious to the firm that I can waive in soon and there is no need to spell it out on the resume.

The case is in state court 1.5hrs away and doesn‚Äôt use the state e-filing system which automatically serves the filings on all parties (although they accept filing via email). 

Partner and I filed a motion to dismiss or for a more definite statement, which the court granted, ordering plaintiff to file an amended complaint by October 18. The deadline rolls past with no amended complaint in sight (I‚Äôm checking the online register of actions daily), so in mid-November we file a renewed motion to dismiss, and for involuntary dismissal for failure to comply with court order. Hearing set for Jan 17, but last weekend the court clerk emails saying the can‚Äôt find our motion, and requesting a copy. We send, and the court adjourns our hearing, indicating that the motion would be decided without oral argument. 

Today we get the order denying our motion and stating that the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 18, but never served it. Sure as shit, I check the register of actions and there‚Äôs an entry on October 18 showing filing of an amended complaint.

334,413,Feeling Like A Failure,10gnd3b,"I was barred in a UBE state after I passed in February last year. I got this opportunity to do environmental litigation and I made sure the partner who hired me knew I wasn't a CA lawyer. At first, I liked it because I was doing lots of research and mostly internal memos. I am not trying to throw CA people under the bus but it's frustrating that OC misrepresents the case law (i.e. it's true but only in a very specific context that doesn't apply). Still, I don't mind having to ""check"" OC's cited cases because I am ruling good at highlighting distinguishing factors. 

However, I recently got a taste of litigation assignments (?) and I am feeling like a dismal failure -- I feel guilty for logging hours. I am feeling like I am not cut out for California law -- and I am constantly nervous that I am not doing something as fast as I should or could be (for the sake of billing). 

The guilt and imposter syndrome is so bad my stomach constantly hurts and I feel so tense just doing something (editing/drafting). My current assignment is  an Ex Parte Application to advance reservations & waiving the IDC -- I only got exposed to my first set of Motions To Compel Responses not even a week ago and I am just at a loss as to what to do. We're using firm templates but I don't think I am performing in a way that benefits my team or the firm. 

I have no idea how to build up my confidence and I am ""training"" with a Paralegal who seems like she knows the ins and outs but she's not teaching me the why behind things, It's just ""normally we do this"" -- I got pulled in the middle of the case and so I am struggling to piece stuff together although I refer to CA's Civil Code whenever I can. 

I just wish that there was a guide or manual for all of this -- I feel like my head is on the chopping block or at the very least that I am always at risk of getting cut. I knew the money wasn't going to be big because it's a 42% hourly paycut from what I made as a law school paralegal in a state law area NOT factoring in the additional taxes I have to pay \]

I have repeatedly made it known that I feel like I am drinking out of a fire hose and it hasn't  been 3 months on the job. I don't know how to bill outside of blocks but cause I am only working on an assignment by assignment basis given the fact that I don't live in CA. 

I just constantly feel dumb or incompetent -- also, the way CA does things is very foreign to me. The partner over me is super nice though and he has offered to work with me in terms of taking the CA bar (unsure if I can do another bar mentally/time wise and what I see on CA Bar subs/online has made things worse not better)

This split doesn't seem fair since I'm an associate with no ownership I don't shoulder 1/3 of the expenses just like I don't gain 1/3 of the profits.

351,433,Should I Quit Being a Lawyer?,10fe13i,"So, ever since law school, I have struggled with whether or not I should be an attorney. This mainly started in law school because that time was basically hell for me. Although I know it's like that for most people. I felt I could barely keep up with all that was expected of me, and on top of that, I did very poorly in my legal writing class my 1L year. So you can imagine how me thinking I can't WRITE like a lawyer would lead me to have some issues. 

My first job out of law school I was a judicial clerk for a civil judge who pretty much did everything himself, all I had to do was summarize very simple motions, i.e., requests to extend discovery or default judgments. Very easy. My next job after that I worked at a general litigation firm in a very small town with a bunch of very old lawyers. Again I didn't have a lot of responsibilities or difficult job duties. Mainly just drafting up very simple wills or estate documents, or dealing with municipalities when they would ask, hey, can you update our policy for our library employees?

After almost 2 years of making 60K with a dying firm, I decided to look elsewhere. I got a job at an elder law firm in a more metropolitan area. My job was drafting up trusts, wills to go with those trusts, and dealing with some trust and estate administration and probate. I didn't even last 3 months. I was in way over my head and couldn't do things fast enough (especially getting the hang of dictation which was a PAIN IN THE ASS) and didn't put in enough time to suit my bosses. They had one meeting with me to discuss that I wasn't meeting expectations, then I was fired a month later. 

After that, I had to kind of scramble to find something else with my rent payments looming. I found another job with a firm that does real estate and land use development (sound boring? that's because it is). They knew I didn't have much experience in their field but seemed willing to train me. After about a year, I asked for a performance review. It didn't go great. They said everyone in the office liked me, but I had problems with my legal writing and work product. Things were going out incorrectly, I didn't handle one planning board hearing well, etc. That was in October. 

Last month we had our year end reviews. I thought it would go well because a brief I recently worked on got complimented (by the partner I did it with) and my ability to handle a hearing has improved GREATLY, IMO. 

But of course, it didn't go well. They informed me that I still wasn't meeting expectations and that because of that I would not be getting a raise or a year end bonus. I argued my way into a small raise and a year end bonus after having to explain to my bosses that according to me, I was improving. But I still feel...like a fuck up. I still feel like I don't know what I'm doing and that no matter how hard I try or how much I proofread or ask questions, I will make mistakes. Hell, EVERYONE makes mistakes. But I'm so afraid a mistake will get me fired.

So, at what point do I throw in the towel and try to find another profession, or at least another area of the law that doesn't make me roll my eyes. I find it so incredibly difficult to care about what I'm doing and I think therein lies the main problem. It's hard for me to be good at something I don't care about, and then it becomes even harder when I constantly feel like I SUCK at what I'm doing. 

I don't have a lot of other attorney friends (because law school was terrible), so I'm hoping some of you out there will have had similar experiences? Or at least give me some advice as to if I should give up, change my field, etc. Because maybe the money and ""prestige"" of being an attorney just isn't worth it...",VaporeonIsMySpirit,17,18,0.91

They couldn't manage a caseload,  talk to clients, or even follow simple court rules. When I was trying to reassign their cases, I discovered the person hadn't been inputting their timekeeping since nearly the beginning, despite me personally going over that with them a few times (when I'd caught some pretty glaring errors in some cases earlier on) and stressing the importance. I'm flummoxed. I was not the person who interviewed them or had any part in the hiring process but I know the person who did and he basically said how good a resume this person had. I visited this person's linkedin and indeed, the resume looks good, 6-7 years at one firm, 2-3 years at a well-known big law firm, good law school, one ringing endorsement about their intelligence and skills. Apparently the person made a comment on starting with my firm to one of my colleague's that they were taking a huge pay cut to even work at our firm. But this person was completely incompetent in my opinion, utterly useless, and one of the worst hires we have ever had and my firm is not small 60-100 lawyers (this person was also given a really high starting salary given the experience they supposedly came in with, suffice it to say, the boss was not sorry to see this person leave, we were all relieved quite frankly). So what gives? How does someone make it through 8-10 years at other law firms and come out useless?

356,441,"Lawyers, never throw your support staff under the bus",10eywzd,"This is one of my top rules. Don't do it when they actually make a mistake, and certainly do not do it behind their backs to cover for your own mistake in front of a client, OC, or court. 

1. If I make a mistake, I make sure that my legal assistant knows that =I know= that I made the mistake. I will clearly tell her ""I am the one who screwed that up"" so that there is no ambiguity. Even if we were both in error on something, I make sure she knows that I take 100% responsibility for my part in making the mistake. 
2. If I have to clear up a mistake that I made with OC or a court, I will CC my legal assistant on that communication so that she knows that I won't chalk the mistake up to ""staff error"" behind her back to cover for my own mistake. I just did that today (hence this post). 
3. If she makes a mistake, I'm the lawyer, it's my law firm, and I'm ultimately responsible for it. So I will have my law firm take public responsibility for it without pointing out anyone in particular. I can speak to her privately. 

And, I always recognize the proven truth that my legal assistant makes less mistakes than I do. I cannot expect her to be more ""perfect"" than I am. 

Earlier today, I was talking to a former paralegal who has horror stories of attorneys throwing her under the bus to protect their own egos, when she made a (fixable) mistake, or when they made a mistake and didn't want to take responsibility for it. It caused her a lot of pain as a young paralegal. 

Do not throw your staff under the bus. If you do, you are treating them as disposable, and less valuable than you as a person. 

Besides paying them properly and listening to their ideas, this is one of the key ways that you show your support staff respect. Rant over.",tvtv3323,43,257,0.96

The primary reason I left my last job was because I was focused solely on litigation and wanted to do also work non-litigation things within my practice area.  When I left my last job, I wanted to go to another firm that would let me do both, but there were some politics at play between my firm and some of the others in the practice area.  So I decided to pursue in-house roles.

The pay is slightly better than my current job.  Most of the benefits and PTO are comparable, but I have no idea if/what their parental leave benefits are.  They very much want people in the office most of the time and I don't think I'd have a ton of flexibility plus I'd be returning to billable hours. I've enjoyed working with everyone at the firm, but obviously don't know how they'd be to work for.  I think going to the firm would probably give me more and better opportunities in the long run.

I think ultimately it comes down to whether I'd rather stay in a job that I don't feel intellectually satisfied in but which gives me more flexibility and no billable hours versus returning to private practice to feel more intellectually stimulated but which will likely not be as flexible in terms of my schedule.

I'm beginning to realize that I'm much more interested in the humanities aspect of environmental science than the STEM aspect. Law school seems like my most viable option as of right now, but I'm on the fence as to whether I should apply.  I'd like to attend school in WA state because of concern for my finances, and I'd like to live in WA post graduation. The options for law school in WA are University of WA (UW), Seattle U (SU), or Gonzaga. UW is the only school with an actual concentration in environmental law. I'm passionate about social justice, so I'd potentially be willing to concentrate on fields like family law or civil rights. Money isn't my main concern, but I would prefer a comfortable living wage. I'm concerned because I don't feel confident that if I pursued environmental law in WA, I'd be able to find work. Additionally, there's no guarantee I'll even get into a law school in WA.

418,526,Moving from private practice to in house,1090x80,"Hello legalbeagles!

Advice please.

Looking to transition from private practice to in house. Have mostly employment law experience.

It seems like in house counsel roles are more commercial law and you are usually a major internal stakeholder that works alongside or with other business partners / big players of the business. This sounds all good to me but what do I highlight on my CV / cover letter or at interviews which makes me stand out / suitable for in house roles?

In other words, what are good selling points for in house roles? What are good values and competencies to display (specifically for in house legal roles).

Bit of background:

Worked at two firms (1st - just over 1 year and 2nd - 4 months). 

Worked in an advisory role (employment law) for 2 ish years prior to moving to private practice roles (outlined above).

Speciality is employment law. Have had some exposure to litigation and criminal law (court attendances to represent clients etc).

Left 2nd private practice role in Dec 2022. Was not the right fit. Was completely unsupported and chucked in the deep end. Left to take time to reflect and decide what I wanted to do!

422,530,Balance between pay and wlb?,108rw50,"Hey, I'm curious to learn more about the balance between pay and wlb in law? I know there are many factors which go into it including location, firm, practice area, which partners you work with etc. However, there seems to be a general trend between big law having the best pay and worst wlb, and both pay/hours decreasing as you join smaller firms. I know that's not a catch all rule, but imo it seems to be generally true. There also is general knowledge that you're either in big law making bank and working tons of hours or not and making meh compensation for ok-ish (or even bad) hours.

I guess what I'm trying to get at, is if there's a sweet spot for people like me looking to work more than the traditional 40 hour work week, yet less than the 80 hour big law schedule which can hit during busy times. Are there big law or big law adjacent jobs where you put in 60 hour work weeks consistently and only very rarely have to put in an 80 hour week (and if you do it's a one off thing aka not back to back to back 80 hour weeks)? I've thought about going in house, but I'm more wondering about law specific firms. For example, in the graph I posted, a good 1k people go into firms sized 251-500 lawyers, yet are only making a bit less than big law. Are these 60 hour/week jobs, or basically the same hours as big law? Ty.

TL;DR: The rule of thumb is that after graduating you're either making 200k working 80 hour weeks in big law or making 80k working 50 hour weeks in a small firm. How many jobs are out there where you're making 180k working 60 hour weeks?

I enjoy my job and focus area (compliance adjascent). However, I occasionally wish I could return to a more traditional attorney position. I haven't worked in a law firm setting in many years though. After graduation I always hoped to become a government lawyer and work in compliance or contract management if a counsel position wasn't available. 

Has anyone else found themselves in this position and either: made the leap to an in-house counsel's gig (unlikely given my lack of law firm experience) or found comparable job in state/federal government doing ""JD preferred"" work?

I am 3 years out of law school, married for 2, clerked for a year and a half and now at a medium sized firm doing litigation. I generally enjoy the work I get here and compared to a lot of my friends, I get a lot more meaningful work and get to truly practice (court appearances, arbitrations, depos, direct contact with clients, etc.) I get paid decently compared to my billable requirement and although its been a rough first year at my firm with some turnover and such, i'm feeling settled and working with partners that are genuinely supportive and willing to teach me. 

However, i just feel exhausted. I work 8-6pm most days, no remote days, and usually on sundays. my friends working these hours are making $30k+ more than me. When I can focus and be productive at work, I like my job but I feel like all I do is work for just enough to pay my loans and mortgage and then maybe buy chipotle sometimes. 

I feel insanely guilty that I am getting home after 6:30pm everyday when my husband has a hybrid schedule and takes dog duty and laundry duty and generally picks up my slack. I feel like a shitty wife most days. To be fair, my husband never complains and has a very ""team"" approach to our marriage and household.

One of the few responses I've gotten recently is for an interview with a public defenders office, however their responses are leaving me with some questions. While I understand it is still legal work, my understanding was that it served as a stop gap to get litigation experience where you otherwise couldn't. Their responses and what they've been asking for make it seem like they are as competitive as some mid or even big law shop which is confusing as the starting salary is less than 60k. 

I'm wondering if public defender positions like this are actually competitive in getting them as I can't imagine anyone would chose to do this work if money was even remotely a concern for them. Additionally I'm wondering how much actual commitment the job would be. Again I understand most legal jobs require work beyond a normal 9-5 and even beyond what the job itself might list but I'm wondering if a PD job would actually require more than 40 hours. It only makes sense to take this kind job if I can continue my current part time job to make up for the lost income.

I recently moved to USA with an LLB and LLM (Industrial law) degree from India. I also worked as a legal associate in India for a couple of years in Mergers and Acquisitions. I am interested in pursuing a law career in USA. I live in Texas.

Here is what I found based on my research in different websites and I could not confirm which of the following information I know is accurate. Please correct if this is wrong.

1. Since India is considered as a common law country with US, I will be eligible to apply for profile review to the bar council (I heard it may take up to an year). If the council finds it okay, I will get a bar license to practice law without any exam.
2. I need to pursue a law degree in USA to get eligibility to attend the law exam. Once qualified, I will get the bar license.

Right now, I am not sure whom can I contact to find accurate information about what I can do next.

I am also not decided on the specialization in law that I need to pursue a career in USA. Any advise or experiences in different specializations will be highly appreciated.

If neither is realistic then obviously prosecution. I'd be interested in thoughts on the possibility of either option given my situation:

My education: BSc. in Engineering Physics (EE ""adjacent"") from a reputable Northern European University, Master of Engineering Management from Duke and will have a JD from a low ranking (100+) law school in the NW region.

Experience: 6-7 years of experience working (as a patent engineer) with litigation defense of patent cases at the PTAB and District Court (IPR review, non-infringement and invalidity arguments etc.) and IP portfolio management (claim charting etc.) for an IP-heavy Fortune 500 tech company.

Given my semi-advanced age and current compensation, I'm hoping for a total compensation in the range of $180K. However, based on very anecdotal information + what I can glean from Glassdoor etc., it seems TC around $140K is more realistic, at least for prosecution?

I‚Äôm more than likely going to be fired in the next few months. I was planning to resign towards the end of the year. Now I must decide if I will quit, or wait to be fired. 

I know firing may come with the benefit of unemployment but I‚Äôm hoping to have another job soon to prevent the need. I am leaning towards quitting for my own prides sake rather than face the unceremonious, often explosive firing methods of this firm. 

My goal is to find a job outside of law. I do not know what I am able to do outside of the legal field and make a suitable income, but I have been sufficiently broken down and I cannot do it anymore. I used to never cry. I now cry daily, always because of work. If anyone has job suggestions outside of the legal world, I‚Äôd love to hear those along with opinions on quitting v. being fired.

488,614,5 months into dream public interest job - too early to quit?,1035mis,"I'm about five months into the job I came to law school hoping for - direct legal services in a high-volume, fast-paced field in a major city. Interned in the area, including at my current employer, during my law school summers, but none of that prepared me for life as a staff attorney.

Our hours are decent, particularly for the legal field, but I leave work and can't stop worrying about my cases. I was given sole responsibility on all my cases, which has been an ongoing load of over twenty since I started, and my supervisor is too busy with other staff and apparently constant meetings to provide much guidance beyond our weekly hour-long check-ins (and quite often misses those as well). Several days a week in court in my busiest weeks, and while I've been getting generally favorable outcomes for my clients I dread every appearance and the constant confrontation with opposing counsel and judges whose decisions seem to rely more on their mood than any of the effort I put in to prepare. As an intern, I enjoyed playing a supportive role on casework and the more novel research and writing assignments I got to do, but now my time is balanced between writing routine motions, following up with often unresponsive clients as the clock ticks down on urgent court deadlines, and dealing with some of the nastiest personalities I have ever encountered on the opposing side of my cases.

My organization has been trying to make some changes to improve retention, after about a quarter of out unit has turned over in the months since I started. The people who've left all made it at least a year, but I'm really doubting whether I can do the same. My mental health has never been this bad - there are weeks where I cry daily; I dread starting work in the mornings, much less going to court, and have thoughts of physical harm over having to face the day; and while my coworkers are friendly everyone seems too constantly stressed to provide much support. I started seeing a therapist again for the first time in years, but it so far hasn't helped too much. I compare my job to friends in big law and when it comes to hours, pressure to perform, etc., I feel like a bit of a whiner feeling this way, but I managed law school, the bar exam, and two years at my job before law school with pretty minimal stress, so I feel like it really is this job getting to me.

I am passionate about the issue area I work in, but not sure how much longer I can cut it before my mental health starts dragging down my work and me with it. I've been casually browsing jobs, yet not sure if I even want to stay in the legal field as civil legal services was the only reason I really came to law school. Also concerned about how it will look quitting so soon after starting, particularly when my resume indicates plenty of interest of experience in the field I'm now giving up on.

Law clerk here, taking the bar in February.

&#x200B;

I have been a law clerk since about May at a small personal injury firm. There are 6 of us in total, 2 being attorneys. Things went well until we hired our most recent paralegal. I enjoy the comfort of my job, the clients, and the pay seems very  fair for the work. However, the following issues have arisen:

&#x200B;

The firm is EXTREMELY disorganized, to the point where clients have expressed how irritated and fed up they are. There are cases the attorneys will basically ignore for whatever reason, and as soon as the statute approaches everyone begins to freak out.

&#x200B;

The Paralegal likes to call me and the other paralegal and law clerk out by informing the attorneys of every and any mistake in an email (mind you she has only been here a few weeks). She likes to shift the blame on her mistakes though and the attorney seems to behave as if she can do no wrong. It is always me and the other staffs fault. To make matters worse, she completely ignores a ""hello"" or any type of friendly gesture. She was a supervising paralegal in the past and she seems to want to micro manage but is not a manager! To make matters worse, the attorney seems to disregard this behavior even though the other staff is beginning to feel bullied.

The attorney cancelled our holiday bonus due to ""personal issues"" right after the other law clerk coincidentally made a mistake.

When I apologize for my mistakes or ask for feedback I am completely ignored or made to feel like an idiot, receiving comments like ""it's common sense"" or ""if you just google it...."" when the matters are much more complex than that.

I am interested in big law and especially trusts&estates work, geography doesn't matter to me.

504,631,How to Spot Red Flags in Interview for In-House Position,101mqtb,"Greetings!

I need some help figuring how to spot red flags for an upcoming remote interview I have for an in-house position.  

I am a 2016 law school grad with solely litigation experience, including two clerkships, working at an AM200 firm, and now in the public sector.  For years, I‚Äôve been dying to go in house. 

I was recently invited to interview for an in house position, but a few things have raised concerns for me about the company.  

First, the company apparently had two attorneys but now has none.  The senior VP and general counsel retired.  I had a phone call with her, and her retirement seems natural.  Nothing fishy there.  The other attorney recently departed as well.  Not sure why.  The company decided it would post only for the junior attorney position with the thought that the posting would eventually grow into the GC role down the road.  The posting does say that the company leans on outside counsel.  Should I be concerned about being the sole in house attorney at a privately held company?  Again, sounds like I would have access to outside counsel, but I‚Äôd be going into this job with no in house experience myself.

Second, shortly after I applied, I was told that they were no longer interviewing and that they were preparing an offer letter to someone else.  Apparently that person leveraged the offer to stay where they were, which led to the company interviewing me.  Should I be concerned about this or is it normal?

Third, I reached out to the person who most recently held the job to learn more about the position informally, and to hopefully get a candid take on the company‚Äôs culture.  The person was pretty cold and just referred me to the company‚Äôs HR.  Part of me totally understands that the person just might not want to take the time to talk to a stranger, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that the person‚Äôs departure may have been sour.

This is a long way of asking what kind of red flags should I be looking for, and what types of questions should I ask, in the interview to better understand if the company would be a good fit for me.

I'm a blind Ukrainian.

Now I have a residence permit in both Britain and Canada for 3 years.

I'm a student of two universities in Ukraine. Next year I will get 2 degrees, bachelor of computer engineering and bachelor of laws.

I can work as a programmer. Moreover, it may allow me to obtain a permanent residence permit. In Canada it is a faster process as I could become a Canadian citizen in 4 years. In Britain, it may take about 10 years to do this.

But I would like to do what I like. I like law, I like defending people's rights. In Ukraine, I have already worked with authorities and courts, and even participated in cases in the Supreme Court.

As I know, my education, even if I get a master's degree in law in Ukraine, will not be enough. In Britain and Canada, I should get a local education.

But 2 things fit me. I don't have a lot of money and I'm not a genius.

Well, as far as I know, in Scotland there is the possibility of free higher education for Ukrainians. But for that, I have to live in Scotland.

My visa was originally sponsored by the Scottish government. But now I live in South East England.

Perhaps the best way for me would be to obtain British or Canadian citizenship, because in this case, I would be able to pay less for my education.

As far as I know, in the UK it will be enough for me to get Ll.M., but I have heard some opinions that if I want to become a good lawyer in the UK, I should get both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree.

In Canada, I hear the best way is J.D.

However, now my english level is about pre-intermediate (a2). It will take me some time to get my IELTS 7.5.

My issue is with client communication and organization. I am diagnosed with Autism & ADHD. 

My autism makes verbal communication very difficult for me, especially when I have not prepared a script to follow in advance. I often cannot answer spontaneous questions even if I know the answer because I need time to formulate an articulate response - I think visually (pictures, symbolism, feelings) and it takes time for my brain to translate this into words that people can understand. I‚Äôm also very direct and straightforward. For example, if I can‚Äôt do something for a client, I just flat out tell them that with little to no sugarcoating. Even in emails, I skip most of the social conventions and write directly.  Some clients appreciate this and some clients react emotionally. All of this to say that I find interacting with clients overwhelming and often so anxiety producing that I shutdown.

519,648,First Kid: leaving Civil Lit?,zzlw06,"Hey so I‚Äôve only been practicing a couple years, had a clerkship out of law school and then got a job at a complex civil litigation. It‚Äôs a great shop, I love the people, great mentorship, great pay. This is not a situation where I want to leave because of the people or firm culture. 

BUT I had my first kid and a switch flipped. I really don‚Äôt care about being the best of the best, or having a prestigious career. I kinda just want to get a job that lets me make enough to live comfortably, and be at every tee-ball game and dance recital. 

As much as I love my firm and the people there, I just don‚Äôt know that I can have that life balance in complex civil litigation. 

I constantly find myself working weekends and staying till 6 or 7pm to get stuff done. Again this isn‚Äôt me complaining about the firm, it‚Äôs a wonderful place, the hours are just part of the nature of our case types and doing a good job. So I‚Äôm looking at my long term options and trying to see if I want to make a change.


I currently make $120k plus bonuses but I‚Äôm down to take a pay cut down to the 90k range if it means I get to work 40 hours a week and be home with my daughter every night before she‚Äôs asleep. (I mostly just want to make enough to let my wife stay home with the kid [because she wants to, not like a gender roles thing]). 

So my question to all of you is: any recommendations or thoughts about practice areas or jobs that fit what I‚Äôm looking for? My thought was prosecutor or assistant city attorney (I know in some states they start around 85k). I did some interning at a PDs office in law school, but found they tend to pay worse and tend to be very overworked.

529,661,In-House Attorneys - How Much Effort Before Cutting a Firm Loose?,zycd3z,"I'm in-house (transactional) in a larger organization that uses a bunch of outside law firms. Every once in a while there will be some kind of problem(s) with one of the outside firms including by way of example:

* Not meeting deadlines and/or not responding to inquiries about status.
* Producing a memo that either doesn't address the questions completely or is larded down with 20 pages of extraneous stuff that isn't relevant.
* Not getting invoices in by the time we need to close out a quarter or a year, even when given lots of lead time (which in turn gets us yelled at by the accounts payable people).
* Billing us 50 hours by a brand-new associate who would have needed 10 or less hours for the same work after a year or two of experience (i.e., not writing excess time like this off as training).

Curious to know the approach other in-house folks take when these issues arise, and what it would take for your organization to cut a firm loose. My own view is that it's a matter of four factors: communication, seniority, severity, frequency:

* Communication - this is kind of the kiss of death. If a lawyer simply stops responding to emails or voicemails from us or takes way too long (like 1 week+) to respond that's a voluntary failure in client service. I'm not talking about completing an assignment but rather just providing a quick response to an inquiry about the status of something. This assumes there's nothing unusual going on that created the issue (like the attorney having a sudden illness, etc.).
* Seniority - we have a few firms that have represented us for decades and know our organization inside and out. I'd be a lot more hesitant to end the relationship with one of these firms, but in case of a significant problem we have asked a firm like this to no longer assign a particular lawyer to work on our matters. On the other hand, if we have a problem with the first assignment we've given to a firm we've never used before, it's much more likely we'll never use that firm again.
* Severity - self-explanatory - at one end of the scale the firm has created a very significant problem for us in some way, at the other end of the scale it's just a minor annoyance.
* Frequency - one-time issue versus the development of a pattern.

In your organization, what does it take for you to have that internal discussion that results in a  ""we're no longer using this firm"" decision? How much effort do you spend communicating with a firm to try and resolve problems, versus ""going silent"" - just not sending them any more work?",JellyDenizen,16,26,1.0

Hey all so I'm a current 2l. I had an accelerated first year (this year) meaning I did my first year from January-August and then I completed my first semester of my 2L from September until the 22nd of this month (my last final). To say it's been a hard year is a complete understatement. I bombed my first semester and it literally crushed me since I never experienced failing before. My parents were also demanding a lot from me and after my first final during that time I got so sick from the stress that I experienced a substantial weight loss (15ish pounds). But, I doubled my GPA the second semester and even was acknowledged by the dean for outstanding academic improvement. However, I learned that I still lost my scholarship because my cumulative missed the requirement by a slim margin. I've always been a scholarship kid, I rely on scholarships and to lose it really pushed me into a depression. All of September and November I wasn't sure if I'd even still be able to attend but I still had to go and participate and aim for A's. 

This entire process has been extremely difficult, isolating, heartbreaking, and extremely character building. I feel like so many people in my life have been very upset with me because I just haven't been able to be available or as present. And im not just sure if I'm wrong? Like I'm open that I study all the time, I couldn't help but cry sometimes, I know I had a weight loss, and idk.

I‚Äôve considered that maybe I should go into law. But this is the reasons why I‚Äôve felt I probably shouldn‚Äôt, and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong:

Lawyers have terrible work/life balance, and for those that don‚Äôt, they did for many years to get to where they‚Äôre at.

I‚Äôm going to be 36 next month, and don‚Äôt even have a bachelors degree, so I feel like I would be really late to the game. Although I‚Äôm almost halfway through a 4 year degree in business admin specialization in marketing.

I have terrible organization and time management. With the heavy course load in law school, not sure I would succeed.


Reasons for going to law school:

Just surface reasons, but still valuable:

Since I was a child, I‚Äôve always been one to argue, my mom has said it for years. I just love it when people give their opinions on things, especially political, social justice, etc., because poking holes in their reasoning is a sport for me. Obviously as I‚Äôve gotten older, I‚Äôve learned there‚Äôs a time and a place. 

Research and writing is my happy place. I excel at it, but maybe not on Reddit.

I read legal documents for fun, as a hobby and for a person with no legal background, I understand the majority of what I read, when the most average person doesn‚Äôt. (Comes with practice, I think. Wasn‚Äôt always that way)

Someone mentioned being afraid of the law being used against them as their reason. That‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôve taken up reading legal documents and understanding law, just for fun. Out of that fear! It never gets old though, I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm so fascinated with legal jargon where most people thing I‚Äôm nuts! 

My education is completely funded, including living expenses. I heard law school is really expensive and having that burden of debt really affects your choices and can tie you down and make life hard after graduation. This is a major advantage for me. 

As mentioned earlier, I‚Äôm a business student and love marketing. Not only that, but I‚Äôve been running a small business for almost 12 years now. And I‚Äôm well connected. And from what I‚Äôve learned in this sub, networking is huge. Im guessing that knowing business and marketing would also be a huge advantage. 
I was thinking about getting an MBA after my BBA, but maybe I should be considering law school. 

The choice mostly leans on needing good/work life balance and my bad time management and organization, and after 36 years, I don‚Äôt know if it can be learned without serious consequences in law school.",100cheesesticks,38,0,0.4
593,743,Negotiating a salary as a 3L,zqpuyx,"I'll keep it brief and give you the details:

* 24 days PTO
* After I am sworn in, reimbursement for bar prep and bar exam
* Starts paying me the week after graduation, but my only job duty is studying for the bar
* Medical, dental, vision, 401k - the usual for a large company
* I have been law clerking for a direct competitor but in a different state, so this job aligns with my experience. I
* I honestly **do not care** what kind of law work I do as long as it pays well, but would prefer a better work/life balance than a big law firm would offer.

I know all the benefits surrounding this job are excellent (especially the bar prep pay and reimbursement). I was a public school teacher before going to law school, so salary negotiation is completely new to me.

Am I expected to negotiate this salary? Or is it a good offer that I should accept immediately?  Basically I am looking for affirmation that this is a good offer.

I don't know what my insecurity is. As a Hispanic female I am always worried about getting screwed for salary because people think my expectations are low (and to be honest, they are). But I want to get what I'm worth. I keep googling salary comparisons, but depending on the source $98k is under, over, or exactly average.

""I have way more experience in personal injury insurance defense than the average 3L, and the job is specifically for a 3L.

However, sometimes I come across questions while reading that I was hoping to ask here. The most common thing that I stumble on is when evidence has multiple objections. 

My book was discussing evidence that may be objected to as ""improper opinion"" under FRE Rule 701. In general, I understand that opinion in lay witness testimony is limited to rationally based perceptions. My book gave an example of testimony that would be admissible: ""When I saw him, Max was happy"". Wouldn't this be improper opinion instead because the witness is speculating what Max was feeling? Or is it something that could be admissible if opposing counsel laid the foundation that Max being ""happy"" was something that was rationally perceived by the witness  (he was smiling, laughing, etc.) Would I object by saying, ""Objection, improper opinion *and* speculation"", would it just be ""improper opinion"", or ""improper opinion, lack of foundation, and speculation""?

Additionally, here is another example I had trouble on: ""Smith has sued Jones, a coworker, for assaulting Smith. Smith's attorney offers evidence that about a week before the assault, Jones told a third coworker ""I'm going to get Smith the next chance I get"". The defendant objects that the evidence is irrelevant because people often make threats that they do not carry out. Ruling: The evidence is relevant."" I understand that the evidence is relevant because the statement by the 3rd coworker makes the assault on Smith more probable. However, isn't this hearsay? It is a statement made out of court by the declarant which is used as evidence for it's truth value.",TryTiny2537,10,0,0.4

Now before you judge me. Let me explain my situation. I kindly ask in advance; no sarcastic or mean replies, as my mental health is as bad as it could get

So I'm not from an ""anglosphere"" country. I come from an ex communist country in Central Europe. 

Started law school at age 18, completed my LLB at 21 and my Masters at 23. Starting salaries for young lawyers in my country are sh*t and most of your salary goes for rent. Now I did a very stupid mistake at age 23. I got married. My parents weren't too happy and I basically got alienated from my family until after my divorce. 

Long story short...the marriage and divorce landed me in financial sh*t. Before getting married I had about 4000 euros in savings, now I'm close to being in debt around 30,000 ‚Ç¨

Before completing the bar exam in my country, you need to do two years of legal internship before you are allowed to sit the bar. So I worked for one Attorney and committed an ethical violation. I was broke, desperate, getting evicted and needed cash. A family friend husband was in pretrial custody and needed to get out. I made the appeal (which surprisingly worked) but behind the main Attorneys back. I got 500 euros in cash which saved my ass. Anyways. I got found out, fired and the Bar Association of my country gave me essentially a ban to work in any law firm for 3 years. however as I am from a relatively small country, word gets around quickly and reputation gets damaged instantly. 

I'm also facing criminal charges regarding this matter, which will most likely result in a fine or community service. Such records stay in the system for like 3/4 years then get expunged or deleted. In my country, only criminal offences for which a custodial sentence of 10 years or more was set never dissapears from your record.

**ENGLISH:**

""The Ministry of Justice - sucks."" Krasnodar lawyer Mikhail Benyash is being forced to debar

The Department of the Ministry of Justice for the Krasnodar Territory ‚Äúproposes‚Äù to initiate disciplinary proceedings and terminate the status of lawyer Mikhail Benyash for his publications in the channel ‚ÄúMikhail Benyash. Lawyer-Foreign Agent‚Äù (telegram . me/benyash).

In his author's channel, Benyash published stories from his law practice, interactions with the security forces, and criticized the Ministry of Justice.

An employee of the Ministry of Justice, Zazulya, ‚Äúexamined‚Äù the telegram channel and found 7 posts that, in his opinion, ‚Äúundermine the authority of the bar.‚Äù

Fokina, an employee of the Ministry of Justice, agreed with Zazyulya and believes that the lawyer ‚Äúpublished articles containing incorrect statements, rudely and clearly showed disrespect for the state authorities of the Russian Federation, the lawyer community represented by the FPA, incompatible with the status of a lawyer, detracting from the authority of the Russian Bar‚Äù.

On October 28, the Ministry of Justice entered Mikhail Benyash into the register of ‚Äúforeign agents‚Äù. Benyash is the only ‚Äúforeign agent‚Äù lawyer who remains and works in Russia.

The reaction (telegram . me/benyash/2459) of Benyash to being included in the register of ""foreign agents"": ""especially when the idiots from the Ministry of Justice decided to stigmatize me a little"" - also fell into the inspection report of Zazyuli. But for some reason, the final words ‚Äúthe Ministry of Justice sucks‚Äù were not included in this act.

But I think you would be the best to help answer my questions or at least steer me in the right direction. If this post violates the rules, I apologize.

I've(37M) been dating my GF(28F) for just shy of 4 years. I'd like to propose around the 4 year mark in a month. Before I propose I'd like to talk to her father. Out of general respect and the fact that he's been a family lawyer, specializing in divorces as I understand it, for over 30 years. If anyone has seen the ins and outs of marriages, it's him.

So before I pop the question, I'd like to ask him to breakfast(he likes this place right near my house) and ask for his blessing(not permission, just you know, being respectful) and ask him basic marriage advice.

Facts: We get along. Like almost too well sometimes. My GF has pointed out how much I'm like her dad, for better or worse. Age difference isn't an issue as he is 14 years older than his wife and mother of my GF. He/they has not been divorced after 29 years. His wife and her mother adore me and are probably mad we're not married already. So, there is absolutely an expectation that we will get married. My GF and I are going ring shopping over Christmas break. The proposal will be a surprise but the answer(hopefully) will not. Point is, I don't expect push back.

So, lawyers, if your daughter was getting married, would you want to have this conversation? Does the fact that he is a divorce lawyer mean I need to get my own lawyer? Like, he's probably not going to tell his daughters fianc√© to get a pre-nup, but he might tell his son to get one. See what I'm getting at? I'm not going to try to do something stupid like buy an hour of his time or expect he can give me actually non-bias legal advice regarding marriage, but he's probably got something to share right?

Longtime lurker, first time poster, coming to you in my hour of need!

I‚Äôm in my fourth year of practice in general litigation at a midsize law firm in the Midwest.  Recently I was approached about an opportunity at a larger firm looking to staff their labor & employment group.  I had my first interview this week and it went well.  However, I‚Äôm still having a hard time conceptualizing the job. 

The position was described to me as a ‚Äúlaborgator‚Äù: someone who is comfortable litigating but can develop skills on the L&E side.  I understand that right now there is a big book of worker‚Äôs comp cases that they‚Äôre looking to staff up.  I was also told that the new hire‚Äôs scope of responsibilities is fluid and could change depending upon needs/interests/aptitudes.

My question (or, at least, one category of question(s)) is: what would it actually mean to work defense-side workers comp cases?  Is it high volume?  Is it realistic to think we would only be litigating cases of questionable merit?  Is that practice as time-intensive and schedule-ruining as general litigation?  Am I going to be uncomfortable about the arguments I have to make in these workers comp cases?  Anything important/relevant about this kind of practice that I‚Äôm not considering?

A lot of law firms have an extensive list of associates and even senior/managing partners with their areas of practice and their contact information.

As a potential new client, should I write to an associate/partner whose expertise best matches what I'm looking for, or would it be considered rude/disruptive? I realize that these professionals have a lot of things to do besides ""screening"" inbound sales for their firm.

At the same time, if new clients are expected to go through reception first, why would so many law firms openly publish work emails and phone numbers of even their senior management? Their existing clients would likely already know all the contact information from their private correspondence with the firm.

I can also see the benefit of saving everyone's time by going to the right person.

667,827,Life after Divorce/Family Law,zk9pb0,"Dear Colleagues,

I have practiced family law for 10 years and I loved it for the most part. However, I practiced in a bigger city and larger firms. I moved to a more rural community as a lifestyle change and I was not interested in any local firms so I started my own. I have no issues retaining clients, and even without advertising it's booming to a point I have to turn away clients. I am not interested in growth and quite frankly, I may be experiencing a burnout which was exacerbated by the problems of a rural community I have never anticipated.

I do not love that every second file has CPS involvement and family violence. I do not love the ""grapevine"" and ""I heard a rumor so I need you to go to court based on the rumor"". I do not love 7 generations living in one house and now we have to force a sale because the spouse (male/female, doesn't matter) is done and is moving away so they need their share and of course, the house is 1,500,000 and zero mortgage, buyout is impossible and I somehow have to argue that it needs to 'stay in the family'. I do not love that 1/3 of people don't know how to use email and some don't even have a phone.

Anyway, this has put me over the edge and after gaining 60 lbs, going on medication, and now recovering from a year long relapse after sobriety for 4 years, I realized that this isn't a life. I don't know how to fix them all and I kept trying to help only to be on the receiving end of SCREAMING and profanities. Not directed at me, but at the ""b...whor.....mf slu....assho...""

I am stuck though.

Who wants a specialized divorce lawyer...nobody. I am a mediator by training as well, but nobody wants me in-house. I have no idea what to do and I am going to go back to school obviously. But I do need some sort of supplementary income in the meantime.

The fourth amended complaint (5th opportunity to plead something the court can do something about) is due by the end of the month. 

If you missed it before, a pro se plaintiff is struggling to get passed the first stage of a suit they filed against the nudist resort they bought property in. I overheard the defendant's motion to dismiss the second amended complaint while waiting for my case to be called a couple months back.

I got curious to go look up the pleadings for this one and since my last post the **third amended complaint** was filed and dismissed. 

Apparently, plaintiff did manage to get one of the defendants served this time. 

Reading the complaint itself, I can tell what the plaintiff is trying to do, they're just not articulating it in a way the court could ever do anything with it.

Basically they're saying this private gay campground/nudist resort is operating as an adult entertainment venue and they can't live there as intended or they'll lose their military security clearances. I can't speak to the law concerning security clearances and where these people can live, but I also can't see how plaintiffs' need to maintain their security clearances creates an obligation for the coop/hoa to conform to those requirements. 

The best I can discern from the pleadings is they wanted to argue the coop has a mechanism to eject people of certain moral caliber and by failing to actually eject such person, they're not living up to the standards the co-op set forth at the time they bought into it. But even then, the coop decides who is of such low morality they've got to be thrown out by a procedural vote requiring a supermajority. Plaintiff isn't vested in the right to compel the outcome of such a vote. 

They also apparently want the court to penalize the campground under a criminal statute as to adult entertainment. Wrong court entirely for that and no civil remedy under the criminal statute. 

They also wanted the campground to give up it's existing licenses (no jurisdiction established for that) and pay plaintiffs $3M.

I did not take substantive classes in this field during law school (my school did not offer any).  I did a couple of internships that made me interested so I decided to stick with it post-grad.  I should also add that I am doing strictly transactional work, which is making this job an extremely difficult learning curve/adjustment being that almost all of law school is geared towards litigation.   I am in private practice - still trying to feel the place out.  People are nice.   I have experienced second hand office gossip and a few other red flags (which I will not reveal for purposes of remaining anonymous). 

I feel very incompetent 90% of the time that I am working.  I've received great feedback so far (nothing bad yet).  I still cannot shake the feeling of incompetence though.  I feel very lost on a lot of assignments and as a new person, I do not want to bother others with millions of questions all the time.  I know - people will say ""but how are you supposed to learn?""  I just dont want people thinking I need my hand held but tbh sometimes I do.  The workload is a lot and I am not always provided with deadlines (even when I ask).  It's a tough balancing act, which causes me to shutdown physically and mentally. 

I suppose it's ""clean work"" and fits my personality being that I am not adversarial.  Some aspects of it are fulfilling but I could care less about other parts.  

I am grateful that I got this far but sometimes I feel like this profession isn't for me. I am not sure I can handle the pressure.  I think the pressure comes from mostly myself though - not necessarily anyone at my job.  I am disappointed in myself that I got this far and it's not making me happy.  Sometimes, I want to quit my job.  Sometimes, I want to quit the profession all together because I am not sure starting somewhere else will fix things.  I really don't know.  

I am sure with time, things will get easier.  Right now, I don't see the light.  I've been depressed, crying a lot, and it's starting to impact my home life and other relationships.

So here it goes :    I am thinking to sue a family member to civil charges for him to pay for my therapy and all the days off of work i had to take because of our supreme court process.  I have been in the court process for now 5years for sexual assault at the age of 16 from this man who has also assaulted other family members. I have fought to prove that is guilty after 10years since the assault. I have won my case, he was declared guilty with 6month jail and 2years of AA meeting, not allowed to contact me, not allowed near children ect. 
Now the sentence given(2017 to 2022) he decides to appeal the judgment, giving him 6month to more than 2years BEFORE THE APPEAL DATE.  Meaning he might go to jail in 2-3years or not at all if the appeal is accepted.  This system is fucking insulting i have passed a preliminary hearing from quebec to ontario(where he has assaulted me) and i have done a supreme court trial. So much anxiety, pain and suffering for me and my family, so much betrayal from other member of the family knowing this fkg pedophil.. Anyways. 
Will it cost me more than what i can get if i sue him to civil?  Do i have a chance to ruin my supreme court trial? Should i sue him or just trust the system. I am so discourage and dont know anything about ontario civil sueing process.

683,846,Why do so many people want to do transactional law?,zhsgqx,"When most of it is just circulating meaningless paperwork and can get very administrative.

Most agreements are in template/precedent form so it's highly unlikely you'll ever be drafting something from scratch. 

Then it's just a matter of filling in details in placeholders or amending 1 or 2 clauses.

 You seriously didn't need to go to law school for that - any idiot can do it.

 Law school is a scam - especially if you are getting transactional law - 4 or 3 years of law school (depending on the country) to just be a glorified proofreader?

686,851,How to choose a specialty,zh4idd,"Greetings lawyers of Reddit,

I am a practicing tax CPA applying for law school for fall of 2023, and I'd like to narrow down my intended path both to help me write a coherent personal statement, and for the sake of actual career planning.  

While I obviously have a background and familiarity with financial and tax issues, and it seems reasonable to favor a path that uses this in some manner, I don't think it would be the best idea to pursue tax law simply because I'm already familiar with the subject matter.  I'm not opposed to tax law, but I feel strongly that I need to get more exposure to other fields before making that decision.

A few fields that seem potentially appealing and are related to my background include: tax, real estate, securities, bankruptcy and corporate law in general.  However, here's where it gets a little tricky:  I've started to realize that I really enjoy doing research, writing and building arguments and as far as I understand the fields, you don't really get to do those things much in transactional roles.  I'm currently torn between whether I should do something that is more similar to my background or pursue the areas that seem most interesting.  

Some of the areas outside my background that are potentially interesting include: business litigation, areas involving constitutional law, and appellate work.  Ideally, I'd like to hear from someone who has exposure in some way or another to some of the work in each of the two broad groups I mentioned, but any advice is welcome.",WorkAcctNoTentacles,33,6,0.8

The founders only wanted a small voluntary army raised with a large armed populace and a navy defending the nation. This is in the Federalist Papers.
