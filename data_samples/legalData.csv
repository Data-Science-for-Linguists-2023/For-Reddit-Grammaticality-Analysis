0,Could this be considered “Selling Food Stamps” Fraud?,11alnny,"I had been asked by a customer if I’d be willing to pay $10 with my Debit Card for gas, in exchange they’d buy me $10 worth of snacks with their EBT Card. Sometime later I had brought it up in conversation with one of my parents, who had said that is “selling food stamps”/fraud. I wasn’t aware of this until now, and had no intention of breaking any laws. Should I be worried?",ManAlsoMan,0,1,1.0
1,Please help me,11alkcw,"     I apologize for the length of this post, I truly don't know where else to turn. Almost twenty years ago I was over prescribed opiate medication and ever since then I have struggled with my addiction and trying to find recovery. I have tried every method of recovery, from MAT to long term rehab, and the longest period of sobriety I ever had (3 years) came after going to the local Methadone clinic. I built up to 75mgs and then weaned down to about 5mgs. My last relapse was in 2019 and in the spring of 2021, I returned to the Methadone clinic because I know it worked the best for me personally to maintain long periods of sobriety. However, due to an illness brought on by multiple prescribed psychiatric medications in 2014 (drug induced prolonged QTc) and the possibility Methadone can also cause this condition, I was denied treatment. The alternative I was offered was Subutex, which my insurance doesn't pay for, as I am unable to take Suboxone. When I was denied treatment, I wrote the doctor a 5 page paper that included citations for the research that recommended not prescribing the Methadone could be just as dangerous, if not even more so. I returned seeking treatment in December, with a recent EKG that showed an almost high QTc (that occured in active detox) he informed me that he  would start me on a much lower dose of Methadone, and increase the dose at a much slower rate due to my history of a prolonged QTc. This was dependent on me having regular EKGs and getting back in with a cardiologist, but he made sure to say he didn't think I could get to a stable dose. 

     However, after I started on Methadone my QTc actually dropped, which is something I told the doctor would happen. I just had my third EKG last week and it is still normal, which left my new cardiologist asking what the problem was getting me on a stable dose. Currently I am at 35 mg, after starting at 15 mg, back in December, and not even close to a stable dose. Most patients stabilize between 60mg or 90mg after an initial starting dose of 30mg. They increase 5 mg every 3 days until they get to 60mg automatically, and at that point they can request a 5mg to 10mg increase from their counselor if they are still experiencing sickness. So, most patients reach a relatively stable dose within three weeks after their initial dose. Due to the low dose I am still on, I am still getting sick in the afternoon and evening. Trying to find recovery and a job, and a way to pay for housing is exceedingly difficult if I have to lay down at 2pm to deal with symptoms of withdrawal, so I am still using Fentanyl. Most days I honestly choose the withdrawal but I can't maintain this way much longer. Since the physician cited his desire to not cause harm, how are his actions remotely legal? He is going against current prescribing recommendations, he is not a cardiologist, and all the tests he has asked for have been normal. The only alternative he offered is way outside of my price range due to insurance coverage, and I am also unable to get a second opinion  due to West Virginia allowing only one company to prescribe methadone. Refusing to get me on a stable dose has kept me using Fentanyl, which I have died from more times than the prolonged QTc has killed me. I want more than anything to be off Fentanyl and to rebuild my life. I feel like I am in a Catch 22 and it's a battle I'm really tired of fighting. Do I have any legal options to force them to follow current recommended guidelines and get me to a stable dose? Especially in light of the normal test results and doing everything asked of me. Also, could this doctor be subject to legal action if I did overdose and die because he hesitated to use a treatment that could have prevented my death? And if there is no legal basis and if anyone has any general advice I am up for that as well.",k0rum1j0,0,1,1.0
2,Whole family being falsely accused by ex sister in law,11ald1n,"I want to start of by saying in my culture it's pretty common for a large family to live together and the sister in law in subject never wanted to live separately from the whole family and alone with her husband. Everything was willingly. So to start off - I have 2 brothers, 1 of which is happily married with 2 kids and the other one who was married to the girl in question and there's me the sister and my parents who all live together (a lot going on but it works for us). 

To start off, my brother got married to this girl a few years ago oversees (arranged) and everything was consensual from both parties and we had the marriage ceremony and came back to the states and applied for her visa. During this time period - we were called by some low class politician back where she lived claiming he was already married to her and that our marriage we did is not valid and to leave her. Just fyi both of her parents are no longer alive and it was her extended family and brother in charge of this wedding so we barely had communication with anyone but her at one point. We tried to end things but most of family was hesitant and thought it might be a baseless prank or whatever even though there were pics of her with his sisters at some wedding so they knew each other for sure. Some weeks had passed and claims came out he was murdered and since he was a politician of some sort it was posted all over the foreign news channels and youtube so it's there but it was so weird being exposed to something so strange like this. My family decided to continue with the marriage as they thought that was over with. 

So couple years later visa comes in we go back have a nice fun wedding everyone was happy but from the first night it seemed very clear she did not want a relationship with my brother. And in December of last year she came to the states with us and not even 3 months in she had a whole screaming match with my parents saying she didn't want to have a relationship of any sort both sexual and in general with my brother. Ever since then my brother just kept his distance because the assumption that she was crazy was made and he respected her wishes and took a back seat and my mom said if she wants a divorce we'll wait it out and let her do it and to just stay patient for a while. They tried making the relationship work but she was always distant and CONSTANTLY on the phone either talking to someone or texting. I kid you not it was constant like she would sleep during the day in a separate room and then all night long she'd be talking to someone on the phone and we are convinced it wasn't family because it was every night for hours and hours at end to the point where she would go in the bathroom turn on the bathtub to make noise and block out her talking to whoever this was. We let it be because we didn't want to invade any privacy and it's not like she would tell us. She went wherever she wanted to go, got whatever she wanted - there was no restriction on freedom or any kind of abuse from anyone in the house whatsoever. We all tend to mind our own business have our own work and social stuff going on and we just let her be. 

Fast forward to this past October - she started acting strange and was fighting more saying she wanted divorce but to call her brother first then do it which was stupid and strange like why couldn't she just start it. Then at one point nearly knocked my other sister in law down the stairs while holding her kid. Then one day she stepped on my nephews foot on purpose to provoke my brother and my nephew is sensitive as he was born with club foot so it was hard for him to bear. My brother (2 kids one) VERBALLY went off on her and asked her what's wrong with her and why is she doing this etc. She went called the cops immediately claiming he choked her hit her etc and all this stuff and got taken to a domestic violence shelter apparently while my brother was taken to jail for 3 weeks. Her statement included how we ALL abused her didn't feed her and a whole bunch of other insane stuff. 

We're not financially well off so it was hard to deal with all of the bond and other charges so we didn't have the means to fight properly. She then in December filed for divorce and my brother signed it but she dropped the lawyer and didn't sign which is confusing to us. Turns out she went and made more allegations against her husband saying he was constantly abusive sexually assaulted her r\* her and SO MUCH MORE. It was a 4 page statement with 4 charges against him. ALL BASELESS LIES. Arrested this past week and already got beat up in jail and we're struggling to post bond as one charge hasn't even been posted out of 4. He's the main provider in the house and this is going to take the biggest toll on us financially and we are at a loss of solutions now. 

We hired a lawyer who will hopefully fight this case good but according to her the judge appointed is extremely strict and is hard to convince against any sexual claims. I am terrified of what is to come and can't think of how to stop this. We're scared she's going to come after the whole family one by one and accuse us all of abuse and the judge/jury will believe her even without evidence as we have seen in cases before. 

We're convinced she came here with a plan - just can't figure out what. Shelters don't let you stay past 3/4 months and we have no idea who she's even with at this point. It has to be with someone she had a relationship with. She posts snark things on her stories about this situation. She has some ""translator"" helping her do all of this and have her file all these charges. I just don't know where it ends or how to end it. She apparently has a reputation back home of ""killing men"" and has low class politicians on her side and we get spammed with calls by random people from there. It's just anxiety at this point and I just want some advice of how to deal with a person like this that has nothing to lose. We assume she came here just to get a visa/green card.

TLDR; Brother's ex wife has put both brothers in jail by false accusations of abuse and will not stop pressing baseless charges against everyone.",philismydunphy,0,0,0.5

4,Credit Hack? Can I do this?,11al3kt," 

Lately I've been thinking about how I can tackle my credit card debt while still building my credit in the long run. I have a 1k balance on my credit card currently and I don't have enough in my checking account to pay it off outright. I'm sitting around a 585 credit score and I know that I need to do something, fast. I am starting to get interest charges, worsening my situation. Right now, I am looking at getting either a personal loan from a credit union or getting a balance transfer card to pay off the 1k debt. Then theoretically, this would clear my current balance. Then I would use my cleared credit card to pay off the new credit line at my own pace. Paying off my credit card with every payment towards the new line of credit. Thus, building my credit score in the long run instead of racking up interest charges in the meantime. I know this would hurt my credit temporarily but it's worth it in the long run if this works. I don't intend to take on future debt. But before I do any of this, I want to make sure if this is something that I can do or if others have already completed this strategy successfully as well.

Steps:

1. Open a new line of credit (balance transfer card/personal loan)
2. Use the new line of credit to pay off my current credit card debt outright (to avoid interest charges)
3. Use my paid off credit card every month to pay off the new credit balance (making the monthly payment or more)
4. Pay off my credit card with my debit card every time I make a payment towards the balance on the new credit line (to get out of debt while building my credit)
5. Get an 800 credit score (mission success)

TLDR //: is it possible to pay off my credit card with a balance transfer/personal loan, and then use my paid off card to pay off the balance transfer/personal loan? Can I do this? Does anyone have any experience doing this?",Revolutionary_You560,1,0,0.5
5,An odd question about use of video footage.,11al1kp,"So this is going to be an odd question regarding security camera video footage.

It took place in our home January of 2022.

We were having some strange things occurring in our home. Yes possibly paranormal.  I know stay with me here. The actual video is quite disturbing as well as others we have but that's not the issue.

After reviewing the in home camera footage and isolating audio and what not we were kind of for lack of a better word terrified. It was disturbing we were at a loss .

I reached out to a few paranormal investigating groups and other folks because quite frankly we couldn't figure out why what was happening was going on.

One group reached back out and requested some footage. Well I sent a clip . They reached back and  wanted to travel to our home and do some research. We were not comfortable with that.

They claimed they sent the footage an evp expert and told me that there were several voices  captured on our cameras and honestly I agree. The also talked about demons and other things.. Hang in there..

Several emails later they asked if they could use the footage on their site and I did not agree.

Things died down. i basically stopped talking about it. 

Without getting into to much detail things here have picked up. I went to their site and low and be hold they have posted the video I sent them of what occurred on their site without permission.

They did crop it so my wife that is on the bed is not in the shot but I did not ok this.

I am wondering How I should proceed.

7,Probate Fraud Question,11al04r,"When I was 13 years old, my biological father passed away. I didn't know anything about Probate at that age. I live in California, and I just learned that when a person passes away without a will, you have to go through probate, and I also learned that if he's not married, then his estate goes to his children. 

Well, I never saw any of his estate. His mother (my biological grandmother) did the probate for his estate, and she told the lawyers that he had no children. She made me 'disappear' in a sense, so she could go to court and inherit all of his money and property. Two years after my dad died, she went from rags to riches, because he had money, and assets worth millions. Since I didn't live with him, and my mom and him never married, and my mom was naïve about such matters we never thought anything about it. My mom just passed away, and I'm doing probate for her property now, and I just learned all this.   


I've just realized that my grandmother stole all my inheritance, and never gave me a dime, in fact, she cut all ties with me and made me disappear from my dad's entire family, by moving and telling everyone she didn't know how to reach me, and made up stories to make people think I had no interest in knowing any of them - that I only cared about myself, or that I ignored her, which in fact is not true, I used to write her a lot of letters asking please can I know how to reach her in person or the family because I wanted to know all my cousins, all the letters went to her old house, which she owned still but didn't live in anymore. The family on my dads side really didn't know about me, it's a long story... In fact, she never really let my dad talk about me so when he died, a lot of people were shocked in the family that I showed up at the funeral. Half of them didn't even realize I existed. I have an aunt I met at that funeral who is just a few years older than me and looked exactly like me, it was so eerie. She looks like my twin. She didn't know I existed until my dad died.

In any case... since I was the one who was supposed to inherit everything, based on my dad actually telling me that he was planning to setup a will for me to get everything, and then he suddenly died a week after saying that (and that death was suspicious too) I wonder if not only did she (his mother) have something to do with his death, but what legally can happen to her after all this time of stealing his entire estate and never telling the courts he had a child at all? Me. I never wanted his money after all these years, but I am upset that she cut me off from all the family members all over wanting to keep all his money to herself. I lost years of time with my cousins and aunts and uncles. Years of time. 

His death was very suspicious too... and the way she cut all ties with me and blocked me being around any of her family made me feel like she hated me... but in reality now I believe it was to secretly file probate and claim I never existed. I don't think any of the family realized she did that at all. I don't think they knew about my dad's money. He was wealthy but he lived like a hobo surfer dude, topless, beard, dark tan, no shoes, hippie looking dude, looked homeless but he wasn't... he had rolls of cash and jewels always had money, never needed to work, secretly did investments and just enjoyed traveling the world like a backpacker type of guy, but he was loaded. Totally. My mom just wanted to raise me on her own, she didn't want to get caught up in his adventures, he was too ""free and wild"" for her really. 

Anyways, not sure what to do about my grandmother... I recently got into touch with my cousin through facebook and heard how she was so rich after my dad died, and everyone in the family wondered where all her money came from, she told them the church helped her get that big mansion and shop at rodeo drive in Beverly hills, and oh the church bought her the brand new Cadillac.. etc. 

No one knew what she did.... and no one knew my dad was that loaded, except me and possibly her.... possibly. 

I think she just didn't like when he told her he was going to finally do a will... he was only 32 when he died. Freak accident too. Died a week after he told me he was going to finally do a will / trust for me.

She's still alive, and in her 90's. I found out from a cousin that said ""OMG, that explains why she went from rags to riches 2 years after your dad died! We all wondered how she came into so much money!"" - see no one knew my dad had millions, he kept that all to himself... only I knew really, but I was a kid and I didn't know anything about that kind of stuff. I just knew he always told me he had money in the bank that no one knew about and it was a secret. Well when he died, his mother figured it out and she did probate and got his entire estate, all the money and houses, and I didn't get anything.... what can I do now? Can I do anything? She lied to the courts and told them he never had any children, so she could get rich. Help? I feel so hurt by her after all this time to realize THAT is why she alienated me from the entire family. She knew I would confess that she must be RICH by stealing all my dad's money.. because hell I might have figured all this out sooner had I realized that, but I just realized it today... after all this time...",WhiteWitchFae,0,0,0.5
8,Broad Non-Compete Advice,11akzkk,"Hello,

Current employer does sell the brand of parts produced by the future employer.

But it turns out this person has already spent the money and is now about 3k in debt from Venmo. They are asking for the money back, but they say they will pay it back over time. I'm not sure if I can trust them and I'm basically taking on their burden of financial ruin if I go through with this.

12,Secondary insurance won’t cover the difference of an ER bill,11aksz6,"I hope I can get some advice since I’ve been going back and forth with this for 1,5years now. My husband was admitted in the ER in mid 2021. For one single night the bill was about 3k. Since we have Tricare and also Selman&Co as a secondary insurance we thought we were ok. Tricare covered most of it, but the secondary insurance mailed back that they couldn’t cover what the primary insurance won’t. It felt weird, because Tricare did cover almost all of it( only less then $500 was left unpaid

I’ve called the secondary insurance and they say that the hospital have billed them for the full amount and not for the difference, that is the reason why they won’t cover it. I did call MedStar Hospital , after insisting and arguing with them, they filed a second claim to the insurance and again the letter we received from the secondary insurance is the same, they haven’t cover any of it because they were billed for the full amount ($3k). I call the hospital, they say that they can’t send a claim to the secondary insurance only for the difference, but the document clearly states what Tricare covered. I’m confused, one says we are billed for 3k and the hospital denies it.  I’ve been doing this back and forth with the hospital and my secondary insurer for a while now, Seconday insurance says that they will pay as soon as they get a correct claim where shows what part of the bill was covered by our primary insurance…The hospital says that they can’t file another claim because they already did and there is nothing more they can do because the claim they filed shows what part of the bill Tricare did covered. Is there a way to solve this? 
We left the secondary insurance last year, but at the time we were covered. Has this anything to do with them ignoring us? Or it’s just the hospital who bills them wrong? The hospital keeps sending letters stating that the secondary insurance failed to pay and that we need to pay it.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Is there anything we can do to solve this?

13,My company claims that the medical report(certificate) issued by clinic isn’t acceptable and it doesn’t have legal force.,11akpa4,"Hi fellow subredditors,

I got injured at work last month 11 Jan ‘23 while doing my routine job. 

I couldn’t have gotten a proper treatment for three weeks. Since I work in a rural area which is about 400Kms away from the city. 

Now I got diagnosed multiple disk disorder with nerve compression that caused numbness and foot drop on my leg. 

I’ve been on sick leaves for a month since the doctor stated on the report “not sitting, running, walking, working out for a month” which means I need to take a rest and recently I came back to my home country to get a proper treatment(or surgical treatment if it requires) after submitting the medical report and it got confirmed by admin team. 

But last night I got a call from Admin team manager and he said “the medical report(certificate) that I’ve submitted isn’t acceptable since it’s been issued by clinic, not “hospital” and I’m not eligible to leave my job for months. 

Even though, the doctor who’s in charge of industrial accidents in the site confirmed that it’s “injury at work” 

It seemed like they don’t want to pay me for months while I’m away. 

I did my research for a while but I’m still not sure. 
It says by the UAE labour law, I’m eligible to get a proper treatment for 6 months with fully paid and the rest 6 months with half paid. 
And if there is a partial disability after all, I’ll have to get paid extra depending on its seriousness. 
The company should offer a transport. (which is they didn’t agree with me going to the hospital 5 days a week. So they suggested me to go see a physiotherapist 3 days a week only) 

But they didn’t seem to want to pay me and it sounded like I’m not eligible to get a treatment for too long regardless what doctors mentioned on the medical report/certificate. 

And now they are claiming that they will only accept the certificate that’s issued by hospital with sick leave certificate from DOH(Department of Health, Abu Dhabi) 
Which means I can’t leave my job more than 7 days without getting surgery. 
So they don’t have to pay me. 

Is it true that it doesn’t have legal force even though it’s been issued by a specialist?  
Should I claim this to MOHRE?

I am in England.We recently moved into a rented property through an estate agent with the landlord living in Australia.
The property was newly decorated and it all looked good about a fortnight later leaks started and gradually spread over multiple rooms and caused mould.
Contractors came out a few times but couldn't decide what the issue was.
Two months later the house was uninhabitable and we paid to end tenancy early.
A lot of our new furniture was damaged and covered in mould when we moved and has had to be thrown away including a new bed and wardrobes/chests of draws and multiple other things.

We asked through the estate agent if the landlord would contribute to any of our possessions being replaced and she said no.
We are wondering if she is liable to replace them as we reported the issues straight away and have pictures and videos of the house gradually getting worse.

2. Going off of pay, I am supposed to get a percentage of my gross profits and after I got my W-2 I looked back at my numbers for the last year the numbers weren’t adding up to what I should have made. My pay was off by almost $8,000. 
3. Because we’re in the system as hourly he has to report what hours we’re working, and he has been reporting that we are taking a break when we aren’t. Everyday he has taken an hour off of the schedule for a break even though we don’t get one because he says 90% of our day is down time so we don’t need one. 
4. He also hasn’t been reporting the correct hours Ive worked, there have been months I’ve worked 250+ hours. But because I work on commission I’m not sure if I’m still supposed to get over time as well. But I know he still needs to be reporting the correct hours. 
5. About a year and a half ago I got papers for a garnishment and he said he didn’t know how to fill out the paperwork and told me I had to. So I called the creditor and asked them if they could help me and they said it wasn’t my job to fill them out it was up to my boss and the payroll department but since he couldn’t fill them out my garnishment never got filled and they are trying to come after me again.

I have had an assistant that got fired this week after he failed a drug test. My new assistant is staying at my place with my dogs since I am out of town till Monday.

items were given to my assistant at the beginning of the employment. Overnight bags contain toiletries, towel, pillow, and blanket they are to include a pair of clothes. The tool bag is a basic toll kit to take care of any repairs needed at my properties. Those are only items other than daily carry items (i.e. Cellphones, keys, man bags, lunch, etc.) allowed.

She wouldn’t answer phone calls and told me to pay the tax fee of $1.5k to get $5k which is unheard of. She told me if I didn’t have the money to take out another loan.

20,Housing association negligence,11ak8rj,"Hi,

For over a year my neighbour had been stalking me. The police were made aware and the housing association who manage the building in which we both lived.

Every incident that occurred at the hands of my neighbour including social media stalking, harassment in public areas, general nuisance behaviour - had been reported to the housing association who did nothing to protect me and other tenants. I even was interviewed by them in nov 22 regarding how I felt they were managing the situation where I in no uncertain terms told them they were not and that I was scared in my own home.

On 12th Feb this neighbour procured a sledge hammer and beat the door down of another neighbour. I heard screaming and went to assist. He had smashed her knees in and she had a head injury. When I arrived at the scene he began to strangle me… broke my nose and fractured my jaw. Eventually the police arrived and fortunately myself and the other tenant survived the attack.

I feel that housing association should be held to account. The perpetrator had previous crimes against women which they were aware of and he had also assaulted someone in the building previously before I became a tenant. They ignored my reports of harassment, stalking and aggressive behaviour towards me and as a result he was left able to commit the crime above.

I want them to apologise for their wrong doing formally but have no idea how to take them to court so that they cannot fail other people the way they failed me by not managing the complaints and concerns raised to them about this tenant and not taking any action despite my constant reports of feeling afraid. I could have been murdered by his hand. He was strangling me to death. If the police hadn’t arrived I am certain I would not still be alive.

28,[US -GA] Being Subpoenaed for Child's Attendance,11ak0vy,"Hi,

About two years ago my ex-wife and I split. She asked for primary custody of our then 3 and 1 year old and I didn't feel like I had enough merit to fight her on that so I agreed. I had let her stay with me for a while to get on her own feet, but after she started inviting her boyfriend to spend the night in my house while I was out of town for work, I kicked her out. Soon she started being late to pick up our kids from me on Sundays when she was supposed to get them back, then eventually we just started to go into a cycle of family members and myself taking care of kids (I worked out of state a lot).   


After months of doing this, my landlord announced that he was selling his house and I had to find somewhere to go. A friend of mine had offered we could stay with her and her family in FL  while we figured out our next plans. At this time it would have been about the time for my oldest to start kindergarten (age 5). I will admit that I was a bit lazy in getting her into school. I called the school, and drove back up to GA to get her birth certificate but never finished the process. Totally my bad there.   


Well after a few months my ex calls me and states that she had gotten into serious drugs while she was absent but she had started getting clean, was in an addition program. I agreed to move back to GA and stay with her dad with the kids and she could come visit every day. Well with all the craziness of moving back and dealing with their mom, I didn't get my oldest in school as quickly as she should have. It was around the beginning of Jan when we got her fully enrolled and started.   


Well last week we get a letter in the mail stating that we have to attend a meeting about her absenteeism. A sheriff deputy also issued a subpoena as well.  So my question is this: GA has a compulsory age of education of 6 (she's still 5) and Kindergarten is not a required grade. So what sort of issues are we looking at legally speaking? I understand ethically, I screwed up and I don't discount that but I do think legally there is not much the school can say? Or am I wrong?",jonathon8903,0,2,1.0

In some instances double sampling is understandable as long as the material is staying consistent with classification, blow counts, etc. however this is not the case with the way the driller has been sampling.

I did report this to the firm and it wasn’t taken serious and I was told to essentially mind my own business. I feel that if the clients were aware it would be a different story.

For context, him and I have been best friends for a year by now. He wants to visit me in Germany for 3 months, with a clear intention to immigrate or at least make money here in peace so he can move elsewhere when he returns to the US.

&#x200B;

I live in Germany, he lives in a suburban area in Florida, an area where you can't really go anywhere without a car. He doesn't have any local friends (most of his friends are european, so they live VERY far away) who could help him out. His family is very religious and believes in a variety of very extreme conspiracy theories. That's part of the reason why they refuse to let him leave. They have full control over him, he was homeschooled his entire life, doesn't have a bank account, a drivers license/car, passport nor even a working phone. The only thing he has is a P\*\*Pal account and an ID, and I don't think you can get very far with that. He would need a passport to leave the states to come to Germany, but both his dad and his mom refuse to drive him to the place where he can apply for one. I gave him money for the passport since I'm already employed, but they still refuse to get him one, meaning they have no intention of letting him leave whatsoever, which is terrifying. They also try to sabotage him, telling him he can't get an in-person job because of some extreme conspiracy theories, and tell him to get an online job which he can't, because he doesn't have any real qualifications. (He tried for months)

His family is also being abusive towards him (in certain cases even physically) which hurts his mental health an incredible amount. He can't stay there.

I'm at my wits end, I don't know how to help him, I technically have money to help him get out of there, but I don't know what I can do remotely from Germany. Is there any way, any .. I don't know, organization that he or I could contact in order to get him help and get him out of that house? I could technically buy him the tickets myself but that's not possible if he doesn't even have a passport.

They only bark if the neighbor comes to the door to talk through it or knock on it.

Please bear with me, This is a long read and I was naive then. Please be kind, I am still struggling with this situation. 

Me then (late teens) got a dm from a guy in his 20s who was fishing for pity who would say things like ""no one will love me"" and ""I'm tired of being lonely"" and what not. Me who was then naive responded and was sympathetic towards him. He asked about personal information (age, birthdate, virginity, relationship status, etc) and he would also self disclose. He was extremely clingy and would get pissed if I didnt respond to him in a timely fashion. I did not block then because he befriended me and I did not know what grooming looked like. He would manipulate me to get more info (including where i may be located) and convince me to face time him. He would give me lots of compliments but I started feeling weirded out when he gave me pet names like ""princess"" and others. I did not recognize he was being flirtatious at the time but like I said, I did not have the tools to detect it. When I slowly started to ghost him, he also one day asked me who my friends are and I questioned him, he said ""oh nothing"". (a year later one of my friends said he was pestering her for more info about me but she deleted everything) 

When he asked for more info I started falsifying my answers. I then unfollowed and removed him one day and he came back and got pissed, he said ""have a nice life"" and I blocked him. (This is where the illegal shit happens) His MO is follow a girl and she follows him, well this girl looked underaged. I thought nothing about it because my mind was in ""get out of this situation mode"".

 A year later I realized what happened to me and how he is most likely doing it to young girls and went straight to the cops, they laughed in my face. They said I now ""smartened up"" and said I made a ""regrettable decision"" at the time. I feel stuck and cannot find where to report. I do not have definitive proof that he is grooming underaged girls because my proof is lost and he was very subtle about his disgusting intent. 

Here are the red flags:

\-Obsession with getting more info on my underaged sibling

\-Having avatars of young looking girls

\-Having an online underaged friend he games with (he said in face time so no record and ""friend"" is male and guy is homophobic)

\-Followed a girl on social media who looked like a minor (I lost that information because I did not screenshot it and he does not follow her anymore) like I said he follows 1 person they follow him

Please steer me in the right direction so that I could properly report him to someone who will listen, he found my address so I dont feel safe even though this happened a couple years ago.

43,Child Abuse in Wisconsin,11aj8i2,"I have a friend whose 12 year old daughter is living with her insanely rich step-father.

49,How to protect my assets,11aipr3,"Hello, this is my first time posting here. Apologies for any formatting or English errors. English is not my first language.

I have been married to my (51F) husband (69M) for 13 years. I am the money maker of my family and allowed my husband to retire in 2014 to help take care of my daughters. Recently, some long-standing issues have come back up, and I'm not sure how to proceed with our marriage anymore.

My husband has been watching porn almost every day for a very long time and for maybe more than 10 years. He has also frequently talked to women from dating websites online and called them ""sweetie"" and ""honey."" He even took nude pictures of himself and posted them online. My younger daughter (17F) has caught him doing this many times over the last few years and has been very uncomfortable with it. My daughter has even told him that she felt like he was cheating on me when he watched it or talked to other women. My husband and I have fought many times because of this. I even said I would divorce him if he didn't stop it, but my purpose was not to divorce him, I just wanted him to stop doing it. He has promised me and my daughter many times that he will not do it anymore. I forgave him many times and he even signed an unofficial ""contract"" we made agreeing that he would not do it anymore and that if he does, he would give up everything in the house except his personal belongings and I would pay him $20k before leaving. He started seeing a counselor a year ago because of this. I told him that if he does it again, I will not give him another chance and I would divorce him and he agreed. But obviously, he never stopped. I caught him again a few days ago. He downloaded pictures of men's and women's genitalia in obscene positions onto his phone. It makes me sick. 

I'm considering divorce, but there are some practical issues as well. While I am the primary moneymaker, I am self-employed and won't have many social security benefits or medical insurance. He was a former government worker and thus we rely heavily on his medical insurance and monthly social security. If I divorce him, I'm not sure if I can afford it.

In this case, I'm asking here in regard to the unofficial contract that we made. It was handwritten on paper with the conditions clearly outlined, and his signature is on it. Would that contract hold any legal value? What else can I do to protect my assets moving forward?

Thank you all in advance. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",summer12598,5,2,0.75

53,Short Term Disability with Two Jobs,11aikgu,"  
I work two salaried jobs remotely from home. In fact, neither job knows about the other.   
There's a non-compete from the 2nd job, but it applies to a specific industry and the 1st job is not that industry whatsoever.  


Job 1: 95k  
Job 2: 100k

I have a scheduled surgery coming up and my 2nd job has 100% Short Term Disability (STD). The 1st job has unlimited paid time off policy, basically. They're cool with me taking time off for medical reasons and no mention of salary changes/unpaid time off. 

I want to know/understand **three** things, but the first is most important to me:

A) In disclosing my income to the STD Insurance company under Proof of Loss if I were to file a claim, will either employer discover or be informed of my other job/income? Is that information confidential? I do not want either employer to discover this matter on their own of course, but rather at a time when I choose to for the sake of negotiating less hours. I work for both just fine during the day and night.

B) What does STD insurance typically do/payout considering the 2nd income stream (and that it is nearly identical salary)? 

C) Will STD typically still pay out if I have vacation days to utilize? I see nothing in the STD plan/documentation. (I am instructed by my surgeon to take 2.5+ weeks off from my job, to start. That means 14 working days after the surgery. I have 16.5 Vacation days remaining technically)  


I can provide info if requested, here's some pieces from the docs:

The short term disability calculations are as such:  
**Weekly Benefit:**  ((A - B) / A) \* C  
*A = Your Weekly Pre-Disability earnings*  
*B = Your Current Weekly Earnings*  
*C = The Salary Continuation Amount payable if You were Totally Disabled* \- (which is 100% number right?)

*""****Current Weekly Earnings****"":  means weekly earnings you receive from:*  
*1) Your Employer, and*  
*2) other employment;*  
*while you are disabled and eligible for the Disabled and Working Benefit.*

*However, if the other employment is a job You held in addition to Your job with Your Employer, then during any period that You are entitled to benefits for being Disabled from Your Occupation, only the portion of Your earnings that exceeds Your average earnings from the other employer over the 6 month period just before You became Disabled will count as Current Weekly Earnings.*

*""****Weekly Pre-Disability Earnings****"": means Your regular weekly rate of pay, not counting commissions, bonuses, tips and tokens, overtime pay or any other fringe benefits or extra compensation in effect on the last day You were Actively at Work before  You became Disabled.*

I'm looking to break a lease with my current landlord in my apartment and here are a few reasons why I believe we would be able to break lease but am not sure (I'm not very good with the law and renter's law). I will provide my state in DMs as I don't want to share it publicly. I am in the Midwest, however. The lease started on May 1st. Anyways, here's the list;

1) We have a moldy shower curtain that's been here since we moved in

2) My girlfriend (original tenant, I am on the lease as of now) put in a maintenance request for some general cracks in our ceiling in May on 2022 and nobody has came to do it, and on our portal it says that the request was completed but obviously it isn't.

3) Some work was being done in our rooms and one of the men who was doing the work put a big hole in our wall (it's not in the way - just a big hole) and they took a picture of it and said they'd send it to the landlord for him to have it fixed. It's still there and it's been about a month since it happened. Now, the workers may not have sent it but I talked to the boss that was at our apartment and he said he'd make sure it's sent. I don't like relying on people much, though.

4) There's black (presumably mold) on the upper corners of the showers (where the inside of the shower connect to the wall).

5) We have a cleaning lady either every day or every other day and yet our showers are never cleaned,  the floors are never cleaned, etc. The only thing she does is take out the trash, I'm fairly certain. There's been black spots on the floor as well for \~4 months.

67,What legal action can I pursue against a deceitful MD that has ownership of the clinic I work at?,11ai0f0,"Unsure what this technically falls under but has to do with medical malpractice to start. 
February of 2022 I started working in the clinic of my dreams as a CMA. We are mainly family practice but have extra specialties as well. We are owned by an MD that has had this practice since 2007. 

A bit of background information to start…Time progressed and everything was operating as normal around the clinic. Not a single sign of ANYTHING going on. Fast forward to after Thanksgiving break. We all came back to the clinic from a message from the owner (head MD of clinic) stating he was retiring and would be officially done by January 1st. Mind you this MD has been seeing many patients for over 20 years so very complex cases. We were all shocked by the news but he had been practicing for 32 years so we summed it up to this. Again the clinic was operating as normal, but with an exceptional amount of stress. Patients were calling left and right to get scheduled before his retirement and he had also had a slew of patients schedule out until February. Prioritizing so many patients was a battle in itself but we made due. Understandably we had a lot of upset patients. This MD specialized in doing circumcisions and vasectomies so these were among some of the more frustrating things we had to get rescheduled. We are in a smaller town and it is hard to get into clinics for these certain things and patients had established just for these procedures, so of course they were upset. We were all feeling the stress and the MD was not giving much support. It was one of the hardest things I’ve had to do in healthcare because I felt like I was letting so many patients down and really didn’t have any explanation for them why it was so sudden. Now here’s where i’m asking for legal advice because golly did this situation IMPLODE. 

The implosion…Fast forward to January 18th, 2023 (officially 17 days after MD’s last day) and we get a call from a very distraught patient asking for her medical records because she is no longer comfortable coming to our clinic. We were all very confused and asked her if she was comfortable elaborating. This patient then continued to read a court document posted by the medical board of sexual misconduct of our MD. Word obviously traveled fast and in no time the whole clinic had googled the document. It stated sexual misconduct claim staring in December of 2021 and that our MD did not confirm or deny the allegations but under the medical board he had signed his license away for two years starting January 1st. Complete and utter shock. We are more of a female based clinic staff wise so immediately because uncomfortable and confused. We were not addressed about the situation until January 23rd in a message stating something along the lines of there is nothing to worry about, the document in question is explaining a consensual relationship with a patient and if other patients were to ask this is what we should report to them. I immediately felt very icky about this and personally I have a close family member that was sexually assaulted by a MD so this was a hard thing to hear. Despite this the clinic was operating as normal and the situation wasn’t really talked about again. Things were starting to seem off and we were running out of vaccines and IUD’s/Nexplanon’s. This was strange considering we’ve always been extremely on top of these things. (We were able to change the ordering NPI license and this was resolved.) This is now where I am desperately asking for help and guidance. 

February 2nd, 2023 a coworker found a sheet of paper with an outline stating, “March 6th clinic closing.” What in the world, right? Come to find out after signing his license away a MD has 60 days to sell or give up his practice if owned.  This was news to us and of course sent panic around the clinic. Yet we were not being addressed by the MD. Only the providers of the clinic. We demanded answers and ended getting him to come in for a meeting on February 10th. This turned into a war nonetheless. Most of the meeting the MD was telling us to calm down and telling us he couldn’t tell us legally about the offers of the clinic. Two of my coworkers are expecting mothers and a handful are single mothers, so of course we were persistent and asked what is happening.  He then proceeded to tell us the clinic is fine and we are all fine. We asked him to tell us about the sexual misconduct act and he immediately was irate and told us it was none of our business and that it was just a consensual relationship. Then had the audacity to tell us that the court document just had to state that and even the judge said this was an unfair case. Excuse me what? Obviously very frustrating but he told us that we had nothing to worry about despite us asking if severance packages were in place. He told us that was not of any concern and that we were getting our paychecks so we needed to stop asking such questions. It was an extremely dismissive tone the whole meeting. Disappointing to say the least…

Here we are now February 23rd with no answers, no communication, and absolute fear for our livelihoods. We apparently are not allowed to know what is happening because it is an ongoing bidding war I guess which again does not make sense to me. I have a medical degree not a business so I am quite perplexed. All we know is offers are being made for the clinic but, “none of them are good enough to value the work and money he has put into the business.” I overheard our lead CMA talking on the phone asking if we could return our IUD’s, Nexplanon’s, vaccines and  various other medical supplies. I later reached out to her and asked her and she said she doesn’t have an answer for me other than she was asked to do this and she is just as much in the dark as I was. 

I am at a loss for words and utterly confused what to do moving forward. I am actively looking for other jobs but I have never worked with some amazing NP’s or PA’s in my career so this is a lot to balance emotionally. I don’t want to leave this amazing team I have learned so much from. Again as of right now there is no word what is happening and no meetings in place. But I can see it on our providers faces. The stress. the anxiety. The uncertainty.  

Legally is there anything myself or fellow coworker can do? Loss of wages? Anything regarding our severance pay? Anything about being lied to? As of now we are still scheduling patients out to April, establishing new patients, and continuing care as normal. Bottom line my heart is just breaking for my patients among anything.  Everything I am noticing is pointing to the clinic closing in March 6th. What are the patient going  to do that rely on our care and for their medications? I am so distraught over the patients I have cared for and trust I have gained. Then add the future of my career, I am honestly filled with rage.

74,Help me guys I’m in full panic mode and need someone to calm me down or just give advice :(,11ahnfq,"Long story short me (38m) and my wife (34f) were trying to make the marriage work after 12 years (mostly me to be fair) and unfortunately today she flipped her script after giving me hope things were going to work out…

We have a 4 year old together that we were looking for a child care here in Orlando, as I’m a nurse and we just moved here from Miami. I was a traveling nurse for 3 years and finally decided to settle down in Orlando with her (or so I thought). I just bought a home here as well that will be built in a year.

Well that all is changing today as she voiced she didn’t want to try anymore and well I can’t force her to do anything… she has her sisters in Reno Nevada in a 2 bedroom apartment. She has not had a job for almost 3 years since I’ve been the sole bread winner paying off all our debts and supporting us as a family all this time.

She now wants to take my son to Reno and has said “you can fly and visit him when you want”. Which is absurd because:

1) how expensive it is to fly, grab a hotel, and find time to see him when I’m working here in Orlando

2) she has no job, an apartment that is completely filled both rooms (both her sisters live there and have 4 kids total) so they don’t have any space. Supposedly they are moving to a bigger home but for now no

3) this will impact my son because although my wife is a good mom, I am also a good dad and he loves me asks for me 24/7 and will cry if I don’t spend time with him…

She is threatening to take him and I’m panicking right now… I have no one to speak with and fuck me im scared…

75,tow truck driver stole my $200 sunglasses and 2 pepper spray containers,11ahmke,"I live in the SF Bay Area.  Got in a solo car wreck in Alameda, and State Farm commissioned a tow truck company to tow my car from the scene to their tow yard until we could find a garage to tow it to. I went to the tow yard 2 days after it was towed to get everything out of the car and my $200 sunglasses were missing along with both pepper sprays that were all in the middle compartment between the two front seats. I'm 100% sure they were all there at the time of towing but have no actual proof. I have proof of purchase for all 3 items that are missing but no proof that they were in the car at the time it was towed (obviously). 
I complained to one tow yard employee and of course, they said that this never happens and that they would never tolerate such behavior.  However,  this tow yard was shady as hell when I went there and they ABSOLUTELY look like the kind of place that rifles through every car's belongings in search of valuables. 
Do I have any chance of getting my stuff back? Would State Farm have any responsibilities towards them since they were the ones who commissioned this shady tow company?

So, as the title says, my father was driving my car earlier today and got rear-ended(I was not there, so I only have his pov to go off of). My car received a tiny barely noticeable scratch, according to my father the other car had significantly more damage.

They both pulled over, did not share insurance info, but took pictures(unfortunately my father only took the other cars plate pictures, none of the actual damage).

My father does not speak English very well, so when the other driver volunteered to call 911, he let him. They then both waited in the cars for about 20mins, other driver comes up to his window and says he needs to get to the airport to pick up his wife, states he called the cops back and told them not to bother coming out, then left.

77,Help structuring a nonprofit - do I need an attorney?,11ahlqi,"I’m getting ready to file paperwork to incorporate for a clinic.  The plan is to have a nonprofit practice offering telehealth, medically necessary housecalls, and in-person visits. Payment would be sliding scale for uninsured, also accepting Medicare/Medicaid or other insurance.  I plan to put clauses in the bylaws protecting me as the founder so I can maintain some involvement with and guidance of the nonprofit - it’s my passion project.

Funding this, besides grants and the above, would be helped by a weight-loss clinic.  Assuming there would be “profit” from this, all profits would go to the nonprofit.

What would be the best way to structure this?  I have been considering a nonprofit owning the LLC, the LLC being a member/“owning” the nonprofit, or having both entirely separate. I want to form the nonprofit in Delaware and register as a foreign nonprofit in local states.

My fear is that depending on how I structure this I could be unintentionally self-dealing if I am the founder/director of the nonprofit and giving the nonprofit money from my for-profit (which would exist solely for the benefit of the nonprofit).  I have a good handle on drafting articles of incorporation, bylaws, etc, but not sure if there is a gaping chasm beneath my feet that could get me and my passion project in a great deal of trouble.  I believe there’s a need in my area for the nonprofit and it would help a great many people, but a house-call practice is limited in the amount of patients that can be seen, and ultimately won’t be financially sustainable if I don’t come up with some creative funding ideas.

Any advice greatly appreciated!

80,VP of HR asked me to sign an Invention Agreement. I've been an employee for 5 years.,11ahg56,"As the title says, I've been a ""top"" employee for a small, \~$30M rev. consulting company for 5 years.   Top, meaning I do critical functions where I have more leverage than I should, frankly. I'm a Data Scientist and Full-Stack developer.  Recently, I started posting on Linkedin to try to get my engagement up and network more.  I've been in a depressed hole for a year and haven't participated in any social media. No resume updating and no intent to leave... however, of course my HR team and CEO (who is friendly and with whom I get along.. she's bought me artwork! 😅) sees me updating linkedin and making intensive posts (about some personal project implementations of GPT3.5 I've been building... and various SaaS business ideas I'm working on).   Recently, I've had an SLT person or two come talk to me and say they want me to create stuff for them AFTER they write me a brief and told me NOT to start anything. Ok.  To be clear, I have several ideas I posted about, but there's ONE idea they don't know about that I'm building in my free.  It's at most tangentially related to our industry, but Ive been building it in my freetime, weekends and nights, over the last several months.  They don't know about this, but they see the other GPT-related concepts I'm describing and want me to build them.

I think can see what the company is trying to do.. make sure the creations I make are underneath their ownership.  A couple questions:  


1. I was presented this form almost as a passing.. ""Oh, we realized you haven't signed this form that everyone has to sign. Just says we own the things you make on company time and equipment, etc.""  If the company is interested in the things unrelated to my work (valuable ideas) I'm creating on my own time and sharing about on linkedin, why wouldn't they negotiate ownership?  Why almost gaslight me?  This feels weird.  

2. The law \*already covers\* ownership of things created during the course of working (equipment, time, resource, IP, etc.).... so why have me sign a form for the same?....  

3. I've been working here 5 years and just now this form is coming up.  Is it not a tacit admission by my company that they DON'T currently own the product of my work since they are literally asking for me to agree to it?  And if this is the case....  
\- What if I ask my employer/HR VP (I haven't yet received the actual form yet... waiting on an email) what the disadvantage is of signing the form?  The idea here is that, ultimately I want to decline the form, and I understand I can't be fired for refusing to sign it, but since I'm in CO., an At-Will state, the company could try to fire me for another reason and play it off... but if I ask first what the disadvantage is to signing it and they say anything related to my continued employment, then I now am covered (I can record convos as a single-party consent state).   
\-  This might give me just enough leverage to open a discussion/negotiation about equity ownership or how we split individual things I might build on my own time.   HOWEVER, if I try to refuse to sign it BEFORE I ask them what the disadvantage is to signing it, then I lose the leverage... company makes up a reason to fire me.  Again, the company kinda needs me which is why I've been given raises, so that's very unlikely, I think... but I'm not signing something that puts me in a precarious position.  


  
Anyone have thoughts about this?  Thank you in advance.  I know the first answer is ""talk to a lawyer""... yes, I know.  I haven't gotten the actual form yet.

81,Mass Resignation Due to Safety Concerns and Sexual Misconduct,11ahfcz,"As a heads up, I have to do this from a burner account so I apologize if I cannot respond quickly. This is kind of a long story so I’m also sorry if my timeline gets messy. 

I was previously working at a franchised wellness facility in WA which is under the department of health, because our facility allows massage therapy. 

The owner of our facility received a phone call from one of our regular clients who was asking to cancel their payment plan. The client then disclosed to the owner that they were pursued by one of the massage therapists (we will call them MT1) and then solicited to MT1 personal practice. The client then let the owner know that they had a consensual sexual relationship. Then stated that MT1 often bragged about bringing so many clients from our place of employment home and having sexual relations with them. It is well known within our profession that it is still considered Sexual Misconduct if the pursuit took place within our health care facility and there was no prior relationship/they met in the facility. 

The client also let the owner know that they had allegedly been threatened by MT1 and made it very clear they were scared for their life. The client also let the owner know MT1 should be considered dangerous, as MT1 is allegedly in possession of a loaded weapon, and claimed MT1 stated multiple times they have “nothing to lose.” They also confirmed MT1 was homeless and living in their vehicle close to the premises, which we had suspected in the weeks prior. 

The client let the owner know they did not want to be involved at all, does not want to contact law enforcement, nor did they contact the state since we are a healthcare facility. They stated multiple times they wanted to just let our owner know but to please not to involve them as their safety was in danger. 

MT1 was allowed to continue work the full day and worked all day until this story comes to a close. This employee was never talked to nor put on a leave or suspension during this time frame. 

After hearing these claims, the owner then called our manager and asked our manager to reach out to the client. The next day, the manager and the client spoke where the client restated the story. The client then let our manager know MT1 allegedly has an issue with another employee and stated them by name. We have also all seen the issues between MT1 and this other employee. It is a reoccurring problem. The client also claimed that MT1 has “jokingly” made threats toward that employee and “shooting up” the facility as well. The client stated that MT1 does bring the weapon into the facility regularly. 

After hearing these additional allegations, our Manager reached out to our owner and our owner came to our location. After some discussion, The Owner’s partner then looked through MT1’s belongings. Afterward, they let our manager know that “they did not see a weapon in their belongings nor on their back” and that they believe there is no concern for the safety of our employees, including the employee that was threatened. They also let our manager know they were reaching out to corporate, as the manager reached out to contacts they have available through the state. 

After speaking to corporate, the owner let the manager know that the only action our manager was to take was to “update the employee handbook about solicitation to other therapy outside of our franchise” but since the relationship between MT1 and the client was consensual there was no need for termination nor suspension. Even though, the client claimed there were possibly more clients involved. The owners also asked the manager to not speak with anyone about the allegations of the misconduct or safety at ALL. They also stated that if the manager wanted to reach out to the state they can, but the owners will be doing nothing further aside from the handbook. 

Our manager is very close with our entire staff and was taken aback by the response of the owner. Our Manager then decided that they did not feel comfortable leaving everyone in the dark about the allegations. Our Manager decided to not follow their instructions and slowly (very quietly) but surely let employees know about the situation. Our manager let us know they were also planning on resigning in their position as they no longer feel comfortable working for the owners. The manager never asked us to resign but it was almost a unanimous decision (minus 2 new people who don’t know the business) to leave as well as we have all had issues with the owner. In total, 20 employees signed a letter of resignation stating we no longer feel safe working for our employer, especially since MT1 was scheduled to work the following day. 

The manager then let us know they filed a complaint with the state about MT1 and a police report for all allegations without involving the client. 

This is the second time a possibility of sexual misconduct has happened in our location. This person will be MT2. 

MT2 was not only a therapist in our facility but also the previous manager. It was very well known to everyone (including the owner) that on MT2 last day, there was a very large possibility there was an issue of misconduct based on things heard and seen by multiple employees. MT2 also had multiple sexual relationships with employees even though they were actively still employed under MT2. One of these relationships also involved them getting a promotion from MT2 even though other candidates were more qualified. There was another allegation of sexual assault between MT2 and another employee that the owner knew about. There were no actions taken by the owner during these events. 

Since we mass resigned, our owner has tried contacting us multiple times. Telling some employees MT1 was fired, when they were only suspended. Also telling all of us they were never made aware of safety concerns. We saw proof they did know, but are unaware if they know we saw those conversations. Today the owner sent out an email with a law firm letterhead (the law firm was not cc’d nor did they sign the bottom) with information stating we cannot make any “false and defamatory statements” which we have not. 

Our manager has proof of the phone call between the client and owner since our facility records all phone calls. The client is aware the call is recorded. The manager also has screenshots of multiple conversations between them and the owner proving they knew about these allegations as well. There are also multiple written account about MT2. Unfortunately the only non documented conversation is the phone call between the manager and client that included threats against an employee and facility since our manager used their personal cell phone. 

We are concerned our manager is going to get sued and want to do what we can or should do from our end. Other employees have spoken about possibly suing the owner as well. Our manager has let us know they do not want to sue as they are going to be starting chemotherapy and having surgery and therefore does not want additional stress. 

Can we sue for our manager or as a team without the manager being involved? Can the owner sue us or the manager? We are not sure what actions to take as this has been really difficult for everyone. So sorry for the lengthy post.",Turbulent-Coffee9423,10,1,0.67

fast forward to this week: we get an email saying that actually, that floorplan is no longer a viable option for us to live together because too many people renewed. i have email thread of them telling us we can be roommates and i can be with my requested person; i’m emphasizing on wanting to be with this roommate because i have had horrific roommates before that has impacted my health.   now we are being told they can’t do anything about the floorplan not being available, i can either live with a random person or i need to sign a new lease for a different floorplan. we haven’t put down any security deposit, lease doesn’t start until august & no payments have been made.  what can i do about this? this is just unfair, given we went months with no issues and they told us multiple times how to solve the remedy of wanting to be roommates. i rlly do not want to be forced into a unit i never wanted because i signed this lease. i do not like the floorplans they are offering us, i never wanted them and its why i signed for an upgraded version; we even added on an up charge for a specific floor. the manager is saying this is allowed because the owner can change the availability of units. ive never, ever had these issues before while in college and i have no idea how to deal with this, its scary honestly.

85,Texas Small claims Civil Bench trial.,11aha5d,"TL;DR:
2021 sued roommates who moved out and blocked me for unpaid utilities. They tried to get it thrown out.  I have documentation and stuff. What more would I need to solidify my case? 

Long version:

Finally got a date for a bench trial for a lawsuit I filed. It’s taken 2 years to schedule thanks to Ms. Rona. I’ve been the goofy “dumb” friend for a long time and people tend to play into that until I start to have to be the no-nonsense friend. It is what it is. You live and learn. But I’m ready to take a stand and I want to make sure I’m fully prepped for this. I have documented evidence of everything in this statement. I feel like it’s a pretty clear case, but life tends to gas-light me sometimes lol.  The defendants tried to have the case “thrown out” because I had always given them until the 18th to pay things and they said I denied them documentation- which isn’t the case. 

A couple years ago I sued my two ex roommates who- at the time were in their early 20s for utility payments during the time they legally resided with me. Defendant 1 owes utility payments for the months of January and February of 2021 totaling to the a bit over of $500. Defendant 2 owed utility payment for February of 2021 to the amount of about $250. (I have the exact amounts noted for actual hearing). It’s not a lot in the grand scheme of things- but it was during the pandemic and that was a lot to put on one person, especially a self employed/gig worker like myself.

Both defendants decided to end their lease effective February 28th, 2021. I had approached defendant 1 several times in person and through text message in regards to her past due January payments which either went ignored or I was assured she would send it to me via Venmo as usual, and that she had been stressed by school, work, and moving. I do my best to be understanding and reasonable. I had just turned 30 and have been self employed and overall caretaker of everything in the house we rented together. I made sure landscape was done, bills were paid, pool was cleaned, etc. Bills were automatically drafted from my account each month, so I had been getting by on savings and credit card usage which I had planned to replenish when paid back. It was my understanding and perception that everything was friendly and civil. There was some tension between me and the defendant 2- we had been friends for years and she had been irritable to me as i was finally putting my foot down with her never taking care of her animals and always relying on me while she would stay with her boyfriends. But we had talked it out, and things seemed fine (though her behavior didn’t change and I just figured some distance would be good for us and things would level out) Prior to this, neither defendant has given me any reason to doubt they’d pay. I even chatted with them and helped them move boxes. They made it seem like everything was fine.

Both defendants were last on the premises on March 1st to clean and get their rooms ready for the new tenant. It should be noted that this was not done as there were pet stains and odors, left trash, yard damage from Defendant 2’s dog, and other miscellaneous items were left behind. The roommates they sublet to had complaints so I took time out of my schedule to finish the cleaning.

By March 3rd, I had realized that Defendant 1 had blocked me from Venmo and all social media accounts. I had reached out via text message and received no response. I had texted and called Defendant 2 and also received no answer. That evening I went over to the Defendants' apartment of which they were leasing together. Their vehicles were parked in front, indicating they were home. I knocked on their door for several minutes. Neither bothered coming to the door. I stated civilly that I was requesting payment for the bills and that I was prepared to take legal action and I left the premises. This incident was recorded on my cell phone. The defendants were seen peeking through the blinds as we exited the premise.

This made it clear to me that the Defendants were not going to pay me the owed money unless legal action was to be taken. 

For the security of the new tenants, I had the locks of the house replaced as one of the Defendants did not return their key prior to March 19th, when I received it via FedEx. It was mailed on March 16th.

On March 5th, 2021, I filed this lawsuit. The defendants were served March 9th.

On the late evening of March 18th, I received a delivery via FedEx of a document typed by the defendants stating I had until March 20th to email them 2 years worth of all utility bills for them to analyze before sending me payment or filing a response to the lawsuit. This document was dated and sent on March 16th. Not only were they giving me 2 days to gather this information, anything before the months of which I am requesting is irrelevant, especially since Defendant 1 has only been on the lease since July 2020. My response to them was that all necessary documents would be presented in court. I did not deny documentation, though they said I did. It is my belief this was a frivolous request based on the idea that I wouldn’t be able to produce every receipt or statement from an irrelevant time period. Due to their consistent avoidance, I did not trust them to make a fair judgement on what they should owe me. I understand their attempt of trying to settle outside of court, but it has been too late for that. If any indication or any effort to settle payments or concerns in regards to bills would have been made prior to my filing, then we would have no reason to go to court. I also think they believed I was over-charging them- I did gather 6 months of bills and what they had been paying- overall I under charged them a few bucks every month.

I believe I am being more than fair in only requesting payment for bills owed and reimbursement for lock changes and court fees, given the damage to the back yard made by the dog belonging to Defendant 2, the amount of trash left, and the time taken away from not only my work schedule, but the two new tenants who have had to rearrange their schedules in order to clean and make presentable. This is an unfair situation not only to myself, but also the tenants that took their place.",LillieSue14,2,1,1.0
86,Spent 5 years caregiving for my mom full-time until she passed. Am I entitled to anything?,11ah9pw,"I’ll do my best to be brief and also thorough. If any relevant details were left out, let me know!

I’m currently 33 y/o. Live in CA. From ages 25-30, I cared for my disabled mother full-time; transfers, feeding, bathing, dressing, medication management, transportation, all of that. She stayed married to my father, who worked full time, so I’d go to their house while he went to work, and leave after she was fed and ready for bed. Prior to taking on this role, I had a job at Apple and my own apartment. My dad agreed to pay me an hourly rate to care for my mom, under the table. This enabled me to continue paying my rent (barely,) and because I had no taxable income, I got healthcare through Medi-Cal. Obviously I did not have an employer matched 401k, or PTO, or anything like that. I abandoned my career voluntarily, because my mom needed me, preferred me over a stranger from an agency, which also would have been significantly more expensive, almost twice as much.

When she passed away in February 2020 from what may have ultimately been Covid, my dad offered me “severance pay” in the form of 2 weeks’ wages. I had to scramble to find a job, which I did, as a  caregiver for a local agency, simply bc that’s what I knew how to and what I was good at. However, I moved on to an office job within a year, due to the emotional and physical stress, and low wage of caregiving. Having worked in an office for several years now, I’m realizing all that I missed out on without even being aware during the time I took care of my mom. 

I know she had life insurance, assets, equity, etc, that were all left to my father. He has been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and in light of the diagnosis, he basically is taking the position that I don’t need to inherit anything from my mom, because it will be coming to me sooner or later anyway. However I feel an immense amount of pressure living paycheck to paycheck in the meantime, in poverty conditions, wearing used clothes, going to food banks, recycling cans and bottles for pocket change… given the sacrifices I made and the time I put in to care for her, I feel like I should be entitled to something following her death, and I don’t understand why I should have to wait for them to both be gone before I am able to live comfortably. I could use some time to experience the wealth that is in store for me WITH the guidance that might be given by my father while he’s around to give it. I don’t know. Do I have any legal ground to stand on, or recourse ?

87,Buying a Motorcycle Rental Business,11ah9om,"Hey everyone!

I hope this post finds you well.

So I'm in the process of doing due diligence before buying a local motorcycle rental company. Here's a previous post if you would to know more details about the listing:([https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycle/comments/11aflu6/buying\_a\_motorcycle\_rental\_business/](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycle/comments/11aflu6/buying_a_motorcycle_rental_business/))

My main concern is that when I asked the owner for a copy of the customer contracts and insurance policy, I was told that they can't share either of these things with me until after the purchase. Is this a standard business procedure? It leaves me feeling very uneasy not knowing what's in the lines of such important documents.

Thank you for your time and help in advance.

88,Question about bail?,11ah9fj,So I got arrested for a DUI back in November and spent a couple days in jail until I could get a bond hearing. One of the bond conditions was Pretrial and checked was: no controlled substances without a prescription unless prescribed. Penciled in to that section was marijuana also. I just got a med card because it used to help with panic attacks and due to everything that's been happening I have been having more of those and haven't been able to self medicate like I would. Am I able to smoke weed now is my question. I notified my Pretrial officer and she told me to ask my lawyer which he said he didn't really know.

90,"Landlord Entering Property w/o Notice (California Civil Code § 1954)... with *bonus* gross negligence (possibly?), illegal lead paint removal, and VOC fumes in my apartment multiple times!",11ah4za,"Thanks in advance to anyone reading this. City is San Francisco. I'm wondering primarily what remedies I can seek, if indeed my landlord is civilly liable for any of the below items.

# Main Questions:

1. Does suspected burglary constitute ""in an emergency"" in relation to LL and his contractor entering a rental unit without tenant notification per CA Civil Code Sec 1954? Note the garage was burgled, but there was no evidence suggesting my apartment had actually been broken into.
2. In a high-crime city, does an LL leaving a little lockbox tethered to the gate (with keys to building inside, while the building is occupied and has tenant property) in a publicly accessible place (sidewalk) for weeks on end constitute negligence and make the landlord liable for theft that occurs? (with respect to LL's responsibility to take reasonable measures to protect tenants and their property) The keys+box were stolen and then tenant property was stolen from the garage.
3. At what point/how long/how many times do VOC fumes and lead paint dust particulate have to enter my unit my apartment through an imperfect HVAC system, and be present in the garage, to become a civil liability for the LL? I let the landlord know immediately the first time, but because he takes a very ""passive"" approach to everything, it occurred on multiple occasions. The garage had what must be presumed *lead* paint dust circulating in the air for at least a week.

# Details:

First item is a possible illegal entry by my landlord and his contractor into my apartment. The building has been undergoing construction for a month while I've been occupying it. Since construction day 1, the landlord left a lockbox for the contractors on the gate of the building, which is right on the public sidewalk, in a city with *notoriously* high property crime. While I was out of town, a thief or thieves stole and broke open the lockbox, then entered the side door to the garage/storage rooms (presumably using the key), and stole some property of my neighbors and I from the garage.

My landlord and the contractor discovered this around 8AM. However I found out about it in a bizarre manner. I got a push notification from my security camera inside my apartment (not the garage/storage area), which showed the contractor and the landlord inside my apartment at 8:30AM (without asking permission). My neighbor called a few minutes later to explain that there had been a burglary in the garage, and that the landlord and contractor went up to check my apartment to make sure my stuff was still there / if the thief had gotten into the apartment (they hadn't, and my camera didn't detect anything prior to their entry).

I asked the LL if he heard anything that indicated whether there was a thief presently in my apartment when he was in the garage at \~8AM assessing the situation -- my apartment is above directly above the garage in an old building, so this included inquiring if he heard footsteps -- or whether he thought that there was imminent danger. He said ""we weren't sure"".

**#1:** CA Civil Code Sec 1954 states a landlord can enter a tenant's unit without permission ""in an emergency"", but I don't see it going into greater detail. Most internet legal advice interpretations involve emergencies where urgent threats to life or property are suspected, but they mostly reference things like gas leaks, flooding, fires, etc. **Does a suspected burglary with uncertainty of whether it's still in progress constitute ""in an emergency"" for LL to enter?** Note: he entered before the police arrived, but I don't know if he called the police before or after entering my apartment. There was no key to my unit in the lockbox (he confirmed) nor evidence my unit's door was breached.

**Bonus items:**

**#2:** Given that a landlord is required to take reasonable precautions to protect the health and property of his tenants (I recall reading this paraphrased terminology somewhere?), **is there any liability/negligence of the LL for leaving the lockbox on the exterior of the building for weeks?** ...especially given: it's a high-crime city; you can find youtube videos of people cracking these things open in seconds; and that I think my neighbors had expressed concern to him from the beginning about the lack of security of these lockboxes.

**#3:** Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sanding dust: prior to the theft. The furnace for my forced air heating system is located in the garage. The contractor educated me (unrelated) that in practice, this setup will always inherently pull in a small % garage air. Note: the contractor/LL are using a vacant garage parking space to store chemicals/equipment, but no construction is actually happening inside it.

a) VOCs: My apartment reeked of acetone in the evening of day 1. Could tell immediately it was coming from the heating vents (extra dangerous that it's being heated). Texted+called the LL, and he came over. There must've been acetone-soaked rags or something left in the garage. ***My LL, a former organic chemist and current chemistry teacher***, while we are standing in the garage inhaling even stronger acetone fumes than in my apartment, tells me that the contractor told him the workers didn't leave any chemicals out in the garage! My landlord gives me the contractor's details, in a way that indicates that the LL expects it to be my responsibility to resolve things with his contractor. The contractor reaches out to him the next day to say they actually made a mistake and it won't happen again.

Roughly day 5ish(?): I email+text the LL that I'm smelling VOCs and paint dust in my apartment again, and explain what the contractor told me about the forced air system's flaw. He says he'll get the contractor to take care of the chemicals and dust, and have him move the stuff out of the garage, but nothing fundamentally changes aside from some buckets being moved outside.

Approx day 14: around 9AM, I'm working from home with the heat on, and my apartment starts reeking of...you guessed it...primer! I immediately tell the LL again and the contractor. The contractor says ""oh I'm so sorry, it was raining outside, so I had to primer some things in the garage"". Sidebar: ""sorry"" doesn't cut it the third time around (also, golden rule?). It took **3 HOURS** to air out my apartment. I couldn't even keep the back windows open once I realized that the scaffolding outside was itself still covered in paint dust. I could feel my lungs beginning to tingle and was coughing for a portion of it, although I didn't see a doctor as it eventually passed later that day. Note I was not sick prior to that, nor do I have allergies that cause such reactions.

b) I have looked at exterior paint removal laws for CA, and it appears the contractor and his workers didn't take the legally required measures to contain debris while scraping and sanding exterior paint that legally must be presumed to have lead in it. It spread to the garage, with everything caked in a fine layer of sanding dust (I have video & pix). The particulate smell was so prevalent in the garage that I had to run an air purifier in there while I did laundry. This is an issue from days 2 thru \~16, about when I went out of town. On day 2, I went to Home Depot to buy a HEPA filter to hack up/tape to the vents to attempt to catch some of the particulate so it wouldn't enter my apartment.",throwahway987,0,1,1.0
91,Having to appear at court for a collision that was my fault,11ah1re,"I was given a failing to yield citation, requiring me to pay a fine. I was making an unprotected left turn across multiple lanes of traffic from a side road to a much more busier, main road, so obviously they have the right of way. I misjudged the distance I had from the other car and as I started the turn, we collided. I wouldn’t say that it was a major collision as no one was hurt, and the damage to the other guys car was at most 4-5k in repairs, if that changes anything. Worst part of it was my car was totaled. I admit to being at fault, but in my state (TX), anyone 16 or under must go to court to pay for tickets(I am 16). Not sure if it’s true, but I have heard that the judge can suspend your license, etc. Like I said, I know I am at fault here and will use this as a lesson to not make unprotected left turns (or any turns) until it is completely clear, or I am certain it is safe to do so.

95,[Michigan] I'm very seriously considering suing the local post office. Do I have any legs here?,11agx0j,"Long story short, the local Post Office has been boning me since I moved here eight months ago. I get a few pieces of the old residents' mail, sure, it happens. They'll fix it. Soon, I'm getting mail for ten-fifteen names per day, every day. This is a problem. The even bigger issues, though, are that \*\*they stopped picking up my outgoing mail\*\* Nephew's gift? Late. Bills? Late. AND \*\*strangers show up to my house looking for their mail.\*\*  And let me tell you, some of them really want it. Where is it? Well, I confirmed with the post office that I am not allowed to throw it out, but instead must bring the mail to them every day. Then it gets sent back to me.

Every reasonable attempt to fix this was made (on my end): ""return to sender,"" ""recipient no longer at this address,"" then the forms saying who lives there, then notes on my mailbox asking them to take my mail, calling them, speaking with supervisors. All the supervisors have ever had to say is to bring the mail to the post office and that the carrier ""will be talked to,"" ""has been talked to,"" or ""has been given two weeks to correct the problem.""

I even escalated it to the federal level, like the Deputy Postmaster General's office or something (I can check) and got a human on the phone who gave me a confirmation code and everything. Assurance that only my mail would be delivered to the house. Great. I guess they couldn't promise that the mail carrier would pick up my mail, though. You can lead a horse to water.

&#x200B;

Long story long is that I wrote a letter of intent, which, in MI, is not a contract, so the implications of actually sending it are not huge.

It feels like I'm in the twilight zone and it's genuinely fucking up my head, which is already not in a great spot chronically. Genuinely, the disruption this has caused in my life and my routines (missing work, losing gas money, people coming to the house, my mail not going out, etc.) has led to me increasing my medication.

Mail I don't want for eight months is harassment, right? Receiving letters after I have asked to not receive them is unsolicited contact, right? The fact that my therapist and psychiatrist are aware of this situation is showing that it's fucking with me, right? It's not my fucking job to drive other people's mail around... right?

Rules say I'm not allowed to post the letter here, unfortunately. I reference all the penal codes and everything and am quite proud of it (I did look up a few samples). But I want to -- I intend to -- go after them for emotional distress, harassment, unsolicited contact, financial loss, promissory estoppel (based on their mission statement and, I guess, their sole purpose), and maybe my therapy and psych bills from when this started to date. In the letter, I request a settlement for $6,000 to cover my therapy and increase in psych care/meds, wages lost by going to the post office (I usually needed to leave work early to do it), fuel used, compensation for working for USPS, and emotional damage. Call me a snowflake, but it's real. Am I being punked? How hard is this to fix?

98,First Time Homebuyer - I bought a lemon.,11agjtv,"Edited to add: I am in a condo in Ohio.

I purchased my first home in March 2022. 

Soon after, a water spot appeared in the foyer underneath the downstairs bathroom. I had a plumber come out. He opened up the access that had already been created in the upstairs bathroom and found that a previous leak had been repaired with foam and was now leaking again.

Since then, the refrigerator had a problem and leaked into the downstairs neighbor's apartment, a few sink leaks were found which were not discovered at my inspection, another leak happened in the same bathroom. We opened up the ceiling and found a ton of water damage and mold. It has been problem after problem and I submitted a home insurance claim for one of them. None of these were disclosed when I purchased the house.

A person who previously rented the house from the previous owner for 7 years came by to pick up a package she had mistakenly sent here. When here, she told me she had all kinds of problems for the 7 years she lived here. For example, she used the other upstairs bathroom one time when she first moved in and it rained water down into the kitchen. She had a fear of repairmen because of past experience and never asked the owner to fix it. Instead, she just didn't use that shower for 7 years. I haven't had problems (that I know of) with that shower yet but now I feel it could happen anytime. Since it was not disclosed, I also don't know if the seller fixed that issue between the time that the renter moved out and I moved in. 

I am single and all of these repairs almost have my credit card maxed out. I can't afford this money pit at this point. I want to take legal action, but I don't know if anything would actually come of it. If I just wanted the lawyer to write a letter, that alone is $700. A retainer fee for his service is $2000. I do not have the money to pay for any of those things.

I am at a loss. I want out of this house but first I have to fix all these problems. There is a list of things that need to be fixed now, including the flooring that was torn up after a refrigerator leak. The upcoming mold removal/cleaning, absestos testing and drywall replacement will cost me an arm and a leg too.

I have been trying to contact the UFC and their customer service team repeatedly, but they keep telling me to check with my bank. After 14 days of searching, my bank couldn't find any trace of the transaction. Whenever I ask for proof of refund from the UFC, I receive no response.

I am desperate to get my money back, and I'm not sure what to do. I am also based in France, which makes the situation even more complicated. If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation, please let me know. I am considering taking legal action against the UFC for the time and effort they have caused me, and I would appreciate any guidance on this matter.

Thanks for reading and stay safe.",ferdi_,0,1,1.0

However, with pretty much all Vaxs, they don’t keep track. (I can go and get a flu vax anywhere with no card). But the covid-vax has the card and other tracking…

That being said, I have maybe gotten the covid booster about once a month the last year. However, on a couple occasions (including my last) I was denied because my 4th card was full and they wouldn’t start a new card…

Question is…

If I removed the sticker they used for the booster on the card so that I can get another, would there be any issue legally with this?",ThrowawayVaxFraud,3,0,0.15
116,Chase Bank Stole From Me,11afmma,"Hey guys so I’ve been dealing with a situation with chase this past February. So i had gone to the mall on February 4th to buy my girlfriend some gifts. Afterwards at around 9pm i had gone to a nearby chase to withdraw some cash from the atm. I inserted my card and withdrew my daily limit of $800. I heard the machine count the cash, pause for a moment, then was promted by the chase nose to take my card. The money out tray did not open nor was i given a receipt. I thought it was a simple error so i tried the process over again. This time i was met with the message that my daily limit had been reached. It gave me a receipt showing the issue. Very confused i checked my account and sure enough there was an $800 withdrawal pending. I immediately attempted to call customer service and was met with the answering machine informing me that the customer service department was not in operating hours and to call back in the morning. I drove around the lot 5 times looking to make sure my receipt and cash didn’t fly away when i wasnt looking but nothing. I even recorded a video trying to open the tray, showing the inside of my car, time, aswell as the space under my car. I called the next day where i was told that the claim had been filed and was given temporary credit. I don’t like to keep cash in my account so I withdrew as i first intended. I was later given an update on my case that it had been closed and ruled that i did in-fact withdraw the money. An “audit” was preformed on the atm and the money was right. That is all. Case closed and the credit was taken leaving my account with -$400. I asked to see camera footage and they basically told me to go f myself and were being very rude and stern saying that id need to show up with the police and a court order because if not I’d promptly be escorted out. I dont know what to do, they didnt rule out that it could have been stuck for the night and the next lucky guy to use the atm got a free $800. Ridiculous! How do I proceed?",Strict_Ad_3709,17,47,0.86

119,Chase Bank told me there was ID theft & fraud activity - then changed their story. Then it immediately happened again.,11afiiq,"I have one credit card with Chase. I have never had another credit card or any checking account with them.

Sunday February 19 I received an e-mail stating: ""You received a new letter - Your application was approved"" but I hadn't applied for anything new. This was not a phishing email. I immediately called Chase and was eventually told that I am a victim of identity theft and that a fraudulent credit card application was made. *They also told me that they canceled the fraudulent application*. The employee told me he could not reveal details about the fraudulent application but that it was made online as opposed to in person at a Chase Branch, and he told me I could receive a copy of that fraudulent application from Chase in exchange for a USPS first-class letter to a Chase PO Box in Wilmington DE with a police report, affidavit of fraud, and copy of govt-issued ID. I was upset my identity was stolen but not overly concerned about the situation until I called back on Tuesday. From Tuesday onward I've spend countless hours on the phone with every Chase department under the sun, most of which I have audio recording of.

Tuesday 2/21 I called back for more information about the fraudulent cc application and they could not find any record of it at all. I was transferred numerous times, and in lieu of more info about the fraudulent cc app, a supervisor told me over the phone (I have audio rec of this) that there were attempts to open checking accounts by me twice this month, and she gave me the dates the attempts were made. I told her that it wasn't me and I've never attempted to open a checking account with Chase in my life.

Since then, no Chase employee has been able to find *any* record at all of the fraudulent credit card app OR the checking accounts, both of which I was informed about *by Chase*. I was advised by one employee to go into a Chase branch which I did today, and the banker had nothing new for me but seemed curious about the situation. I called Chase back and luckily got someone who seemed concerned. He told me he'd speak to someone in his office and gave me a call back. His supervisor advised me to request that the phone calls be pulled by a supervisor and listened to. They then transferred me to a dept who said they were unable to see the calls, and I just got transferred several more times after that point to various employees and supervisors who were unwilling or ""unable"" to pull the calls. This went on for hours. Finally someone from Customer Protection Group told me I could request the calls via mail and gave me an address.

Landlord lost pet addendum, trying to make me remove our pets. 

I’ve lived at in my apartment for almost 4-5 years, we’ve had about 5-6 different leasing office managers. 
My first leasing office manager informed my roommate and I that tanked animals, their snakes, would not violate any lease agreement, nor would they fall under the pet addendum. We started off with two dogs, and my partner who moved in wanted to get a cat, December 21ish,We called ahead, the leasing off manager at the time approved it, we went in and added the cat to our lease. Forward to march 2022, partners ex called and stated that if he didn’t take the cats they had together, he’d surrender them to the pound. We again, called our leasing office who had no problem updating our contract. 
Fast forward to 2/21/23, we were walked by the city and the apartment complex, city had no issues other than wanting to make sure we weren’t raising any illegal snakes. Animal control came, verified we were not, left. 
I received a call from my current leasing manager, been there since December, and she stated I needed to remove all my undocumented animals from the premise. I told her that all my animals were documented, she produced our pet addendum that originally only had the two dogs on it and said this is all we had on file. I asked where my current one is, she again stated we didn’t have one. 
She gave me a month to remove my cats and my roommates snakes, but has refused to give us her managers information and stopped responding to our emails. This also is happening after I threatened to withhold a portion of rent due to not fixing our washer/dryer which is part of our lease agreement. I threatened to withhold the amount it would cost three people to do laundry at the laundromat for three weeks. 
We didn’t renew our lease,  we’ve never had an issue with any of the previous management who knew of, and approved, of our pets. It seems like we’re being target and bullied for not doing so.

123,"Can a green card holder mother file for divorce, keep custody of the child, and not be sent back?",11afced,"Hi all,

I'm asking for a friend because she can't do this herself at this moment. My friend got married to a US citizen in a different country, where they had a daughter. He then insisted for them to move to the US, which they did. She got her temporary 2-year green card, and is not getting ready to file for the 10-year green card.

Her husband has mental issues (depression, anxiety, stress, previous alcohol and drug abuser), he goes to therapy, takes anti-depressants but he is still emotionally abusing my friend. She has been a stay-at-home mom with a 2 year old. She was alone in California, no family in the state, and now I am her support system. Their relationship hasn't been good after their child was born, now he wants her to sign a 50/50 custody paper IN CASE they get divorce BEFORE ha agrees to file for her 10 year green card. He's been having a paranoia about my friend getting married to him for the green card and is probably thinking she will divorce him IF she gets it.

She got married to him because they were both already in their late 30s, she was in love with him and closed her eyes on his mental issues. Now she is suffering from his paranoia, constant depression, and now she is scared that he can take the child and send her back, because her green card expires in 2 months. She is scared that the court will be on his side because he is a US citizen and drives Uber ....(has some income, although lives with his mom in a section 8 apartment).

I already have an appointment with a family lawyer tomorrow, but things have escalated today. He has told her that he is done and is going to talk to an attorney for custody papers. She is scared and doesn't know what to do. Can anyone PLEASE tell me how this case would work out, we are going to get a lawyer, but just in case he comes home today and asks her to leave without their child or tells her he wants a divorce, or pressures her to sign things, what can we do?

Can she leave the house with her child? Would that be considered kidnapping?

Will she be able to stay in the US with her child, even though her 2 year green card expires in 2 months and it looks like he is not going to agree to file for the 10-year one?

I have already told her to call 911 if she feels unsafe and wants to leave with her child, but I want to know if this will affect her legal case in the future if she does it. Can someone help with information????

I work in a childcare facility. I work four days a week, 10 hours a day. The company requires all full-time employees to have one of their three days off where they are “on-call”. 

Staff is told that we need to treat our availability on our on-call day as if it’s a day we work. Some exact quotes, in emails from my supervisor are:

“On Call is back and going and has been for awhile
You need to know what day you are on call for that week
You need to treat that day like a workday as you may get call in
You are expected to answer the phone
You are expected to be able to arrive at work in a reasonable amount of time
Every staff member is on call for shift coverage even leads” 

There have been others, many of which are verbal, and i have been called in multiple times, all of which are paid when i’m actually working in the building. 

The only caveat I can think of is the company hasn’t explicitly said there would be consequences such as a write up if you can’t make it when you’re called in. 

If I am expected to be able to be at work and answer the phone, how is that not paid? I can’t see a movie, visit family, etc.

143,Lease Addendum regarding Ring camera.,11ae5vs,"I have been in my lease now for 6 months of my year-long lease and have a Ring camera and an indoor camera. The lease I signed has no rules or clauses about any sort of security for units. The leasing agency emailed me the addendum to sign that says, 

“We are updating our policy regarding security systems & security cameras (ring doorbells, in-unit cameras, etc). Residents must obtain prior written permission and sign an addendum before installing security cameras or security systems(s). All costs of any security system will be borne by the Resident. Owner may regulate the type of security system installed and the manner of installation. Approval of any security system is conditional on Resident's  providing Owner with access to the unit as provided in the addendum. Installation of any security system without the prior written approval of Owner is a material breach of the lease agreement. Upon vacating the unit, the security system must be removed and the unit returned to its original condition (unless otherwise agreed in writing by management).

It seems very vague to me (access to the unit once or just at any time, for example) and I’m hesitant to sign. Can they make a change like this mid way through my contract? We have had so many packages stolen until we got the Ring but on the flip side, the last time our property management people entered our apartment (with our permission) they recorded our apartment to show the manager so she could make sure it was clean (they were suppose to just change the air filter) so I don’t want them coming in anymore. 

Any advice on how I should respond or do I just eat the bullet and take down the camera and sign this?

145,Apartment complex is running a nonemergency generator for 3 days straight for construction. Can I do something about it?,11ae1xu,"Around 6 days ago (at time of post), the apartment complex I live at decided to drain a well. This, of course, needs a generator to run it. It took a while for them to set it up, but about 3-4 days ago (I can't remember the exact date) they turned it on. It's loud, like someone running a leaf blower outside my window type loud. Speaking of which, the generator is outside my window, not exactly in a straight line as I am on the 2nd floor, but approximately like 30-40 feet away? I think I'm overestimating tbh. I have a constant headache now and I can't sleep. This didn't start until 2 days after they turned it on. And it stays on, it runs through the night and day.

Anyways, I was thinking about filing a complaint against them to the local authorities. There's an article about noise that I believe fits this type of situation, as they don't allow construction noise except pouring concrete between 10:01pm and 6:59am if I'm reading it correctly. but I'm worried that I'm reading it wrong and missing a clause that says this type of thing is okay. There is also Breach of Peace, but I don't believe I understand it enough to say that this is a violation against it.

I really want to be a little more forceful to the property manager about this because the response I got when I wrote to them at night essentially boiled down to ""welp! sucks for you!"" but I'm scared of repercussions and threats as i don't have a plan B in case I get evicted/sued over it.

153,Is it worth fighting a misdemeanor traffic charge?,11adl69,"On Friday I was charged with a misdemeanor for a school bus stop arm violation. Unfortunately I live in one of the few states (MN) where that’s a misdemeanor and not just a traffic violation.

I don’t have the paperwork yet, I was informed via a phone call by an officer after the event, which I had no idea even occurred. They have video evidence of the stop arm going out as the vehicle ahead of me passed.

Without going into detail, I was able to get a free consultation with an attorney through my EAP. They felt very confident in fighting my case. Based on my recollection of events it sounds like it might be a gray area that could be dismissed, and if not I could just take a plea deal and take a safe driving course and some community service to get it off my record.

I asked for a quote and was given a range of $4,500-$6,000 depending on the discount from my EAP applied to the flat fee…no payment plans…

I don’t have a credit card. I do have enough in my savings but that means saying goodbye to most of it and I’m not in a financial situation to save.

If I move forward without representation I will pay a fine between $500-$1,000, and have a misdemeanor on my record permanently with the option to expunge for $300 in two years. 

What I can find online and from what the lawyer told me it will have a serious impact on my future ability to get work, rent, buy a car, buy a home, increase insurance costs…

But I hate to say it, I have my doubts the repercussions will be worth the potentially $4,700 cost of a lawyer vs. waiting to get it expunged. 

I work in marketing in the tech space. I am comfortable enough with my job to believe I will likely stick around for at least the next two years. If I have to switch jobs I feel like this charge is pretty easy to explain. I just got approved for my dream apartment last month so don’t anticipate applying for a rental anytime soon. Bought a new car last year. That leases me with car insurance as my only concern.

He will inherit both the responsibilities of my old tenancy and my portion of the deposit ($950 of the $2750 total).

By NY state law, landlords are not allowed to ask for or hold a security deposit worth more than one month's rent. Because the standing deposit is already worth one month's rent at $2750, how is it not illegal for the landlord to charge the new tenant an additional security deposit (because then the total deposit would exceed the value of one month's rent)? If they did that, shouldn't the landlord then pay me back my contributed portion of the security deposit before/after accepting my replacement's $950?",lontalfrobotomy,3,1,1.0

The victim, employed by said tanker company, was hired on as an hourly driver. This company was fresh, so he was also doing other tasks that are beyond his title in the company. There is also a lot of hours and pay missing from his checks as well as no true clarity as to whether this victim qualifies for overtime pay, since he was working more hours than he was expected to work. The victim was practically on call all the time and was unclear what days they were truly off, since whenever something went sideways he was expected to come and cover. He was also doing general manager work since the previous gen manager was fired. There was never an increase in pay or compensation for being overworked, only spoke promises with no concrete action. Before leaving due to medical concerns, the victims true paycheck was seized and never given.

We went to a lawyer with the whole concern and they claimed there was no case. We don't know what to do or who to go to since we KNOW we do have a case. We have all the information the lawyers could ever need. The victim has given up, but I haven't.

Past about 40 days from the election, and one of the members was basically ignoring any attempt to meet up to discuss the plans for the future and also to set up a board meeting between us first and after with the community.

I started to get upset and vocal about the complacency and talked to the other member (that was working with me on some of the things the community needed) about the fact that it was not right, just 2 of us working while the 3rd member was doing nothing, not even answering calls or our emails or TXT trying to set up a meeting.

A few days after that, I receive an email that they both voted me out of the board based on bylaws and also copied the management company to stop communicating with me.

Looking at the bylaws, I saw a clause that the board can vote anybody out if they have the majority of the votes, which was their case (66%). However, I had the impression based on the State HOA Statutes that this type of meeting needed to be official and open to the community, but they have done that on a private meeting between the 2 of them.

I was in copy on the email about the discussion about the ""treason"" meeting, but they never officially confirmed that the meeting would be happening, they also never tried to contact me at the time of the meeting, obviously on purpose. 

Now, besides voting me out, they are sending threatening email that I will be sued because they heard I am trying to tell the community what happen and spreading misinformation about them.

176,Landlord wants to show apartment with little notice.,11ac7rb,"We’ve had a number of issues with our landlord - his office never returns calls or emails, we dealt with mice/cockroaches on our own, part of my ceiling (albeit small) has fallen with no response to fix it, and they did not turn on our heat until late november despite it hitting freezing and below and they only did so bc we contacted the city. This time we were contacted by a rental company other than our landlords stating that he was coming tomorrow to show our apartment, with less than 24 hour notice. Not only did he essentially not give us a choice, but considering he had all roommates numbers I can only think that our landlord gave out our info without permission. Are they allowed to share our information legally/show up under 24 hour notice? I was not able to find anything in MA law that specified a time, just that they need to give a heads up. I am absolutely not renewing my lease given the issues listed and a rent of $2500 are not worth it. However, this was kind of my last straw as the man who contacted me was rude.

Due to a cracked shower, my landlord has decided to remodel the entire master bedroom & bathroom. This will make the master bed & bath unusable for 2 weeks’ time. In exchange for my departure, they have offered $500. My rent is $3,775. According to my lease: 

TEMPORARY RELOCATION: Subject to local law, Tenant agrees, upon demand of Landlord, to temporarily vacate Premises for a reasonable
period, to allow for fumigation (or other methods) to control wood destroying pests or organisms, or other repairs to Premises. Tenant agrees to
comply with all instructions and requirements necessary to prepare Premises to accommodate pest control, fumigation or other work, including
bagging or storage of food and medicine, and removal of perishables and valuables. Tenant shall only be entitled to a credit of Rent equal to the per
diem Rent for the period of time Tenant is required to vacate Premises

According to this clause, it seems as though I’m entitled to $1,761 in compensation. They are saying I’m not, because the rest of the house will still be livable during construction. 

I have already filed a claim with my renter’s insurance, which was denied due to ‘relocation due to construction is not a covered event’.

I was under the impression I was renewing until about two weeks ago when we ended up putting earnest money down on the property. I immediately notified my apartment complex we wouldn’t be renewing, and now I’m on the hook for 60 days of rent from the date I notified them (feb 15th). My lease ends March 10th, and at that point they’re switching my rate to a month-to-month rate which is nearly double what I pay currently. 

I can’t afford that on top of my mortgage payment, so my question is: what happens if I just pay what I owe for March and then ghost? There’s absolutely no way this unit is going to stay vacant until the 15th of April, and I find it kind of ridiculous that they (as I understand it) can double dip on rent if they were to put a new tenant in there before then.

My realtor and parents are telling me to tell the complex to get bent, but I’m afraid of ruining my credit or legal action. But by that point I’ll also be in a home anyways, so I’ve considered just taking the hit.

Husband never lived there, but gave wife money every month to pay mortgage and other expenses (even though wife worked). Husband is now finally asking for divorce and either:

A) Wants to pay less alimony but not claim any assets (401k, savings, house equity) from wife.

B) Pay wife what she's requesting but take his share of equity in the home, savings, her 401k, etc. 

Does husband have a claim at all to the house, though, since he's not on the deed/title?

My parents are worried and very upset with my grandma for not listening and concerned she will file a police report despite my dog having a separate report on an incident occurring with me (completely accidental that happened 2 years ago) that the doctors made me file to the police. 

Is my dog a liability for the police to warrant euthanasia for being ""dangerous"" or will my grandma have some responsibility for aggravating the dog knowing the consequences/ignoring our warning? Is it different if the dog is in a gated section provoked or is that not taken into account?

After a couple of weeks of hanging out and trying to determine who we all are as people, I had an 18 year old woman message me on Facebook telling me that our father had taken her in from a halfway house that she had ran away from when she was 16. In the time that she lived with him, he paid her to have sex with him, and soon became pregnant with his child a year later. She would also then send me pictures and screenshots of my father asking to receive nudes from his under age stepdaughter for money. As someone who has been through court at a young age, due to a very messy and only recently concluded divorce after eight years, I had seen many false messages and falsified receipts, and immediately couldn’t help, but have a small doubt that these screenshots could have been easily forged since I could only see my BOs name. But I called CPS and instead of making a report on the screenshots (due to hoping to get more proof and evidence), the last time I had visited, the house had been covered in dog feces and urine with nine Pitbulls, locked in cages with one of the nine being stuck only in the basement where she pissed and shit all over my sister’s clothes. I accused him of not being a fit parent and berated him for his unfit environment along with the fact he paid a minor for sex. To which he gave me a spiel that was equivalent to “ Your a child and can’t understand everything going on.”

191,Social work advice,11ab642,"So, for context, I just recently got reunited with my sister from Florida who went into foster care right before my abusive parents died. I had already moved out at that point and nobody ever reached out to me. Fast forward to Christmas of 2022, my sister finds me on social media.

So ever since I've gotten back into contact with her, she's been in and out of the crisis center, and the place she is staying in doesn't seem to be helping. She's 20 years old with mild intellectual disabilities and severe trauma.

I'm trying to get her on disability in Maryland, which is where I'm staying at. She got initiated into a gang, so they barred her from using social media and is watching out for people who want to harm her. She stays with her caretaker in an apartment and was working at McDonald's to help pay bills, but they confiscated her debit card because she was impulse buying things online. They have her on five different medications and she keeps telling them that some of them aren't working and they told her that she's lying. Her caretaker allegedly sleeps all day and doesn't clean or do any of the tasks she's supposed to do. My sister keeps asking for her card back, and they said they would when she pays the bills, which she did already. She needs to do her laundry but can't without her money. I suspect something strange is going on. I'm not sure if any of these things are allowed.

To make matters worse, any time I try to contact her social worker or anyone else on her care team, they won't answer. My sister tried to put our aunt and I on her contact list, but they won't let her. She just ended up in the crisis center again for self harm, and I called every day she was in there so far to talk to her social worker or an expert on these things (she's leaving tomorrow). They are not helpful.

My sister says that she's moving in with her SLC and that she's not allowed to tell anyone where she lives. There's so many red flags going on and I'm not getting any answers.

So is any of this stuff allowed? And if not, how can I get to the bottom of it? I tried to call Florida disability rights several times and left voicemails, but they never respond. Am I really going to have to take a plane down there just to talk to someone?",AtomKat69420,2,1,1.0

However, after signing the offer letter, I ended up receiving another offer, a much better offer, just two days later.

201,"Who is in the right, from a legal standpoint? Me or my ex-best friend?",11aamj4,"California, USA

My ex-bestie (whom I'll call H) and I (both F) had a verbal agreement for me to provide her with life coaching for about a year, paid in advance. I offered her an extremely generous rate (about 1/5 of my usual rate) since she was a friend and she'd be paying upfront.

Our friendship ended because of a misunderstanding. (Long story extremely short: A shady character came into her life. I noticed many red flags in his behavior indicating a con artist. I tried to warn her. She became offended and would not speak to me. I never asked her to choose between me and him, in fact I explicitly said to her that I was NOT doing that. I repeatedly said that it is because I cared very much about her that I wanted her to know the red flags I was seeing.)

She effectively ended the friendship unilaterally with zero discussion. Many months later she came to me asking for her money back. I asked her if we could talk. I wanted to let her know that I was not backing out of our coaching agreement and was willing to offer her the service as agreed. However, she never gave me a chance to tell her this.

I don't know if this is pertinent or not, but she also somehow got in her head that I was talking shit about her to our mutual friends, which is not true. I don't know if one of those mutual friends twisted something I said, or what.  (I eventually got this out of her.) I do not know what she thinks I said; all I know is that I had her best interests at heart and I did not deserve to be ghosted by her.

To sum up the positions:

* Her rationale for not wanting the coaching is that I am a shit-talker who can't be trusted.
* My point of view is that she backed out of the agreement for no good reason. (And the friendship, for that matter.)

She is taking me to small claims for the approximately $2k.

~~I would gladly just refund her money if I had $2k lying around, but I do not. I'm struggling  financially. She even knew that the reason I gave her a discount was because she was paying upfront and I needed the money for a specific purpose at that time.~~

I am STILL open to providing her the coaching.

Who is right, here? Am I just being an AH and not realizing it? (If I am, please be kind, I'm here to learn.)

202,"Third Part Utility Billing, am I liable?",11aaigh,"I have lived in my townhome for almost two years. An investment company came in and purchased the property from the previous ownership, changed the property management company, etc.

I had just signed my renewal right before they purchased the property, so my original lease/contract is currently in existence for the next two months.

This current owner/property manager took the utilities out of my name and put it in the name of some third-party company that apparently manages utilities. So I get this random bill from a company I am not familiar with for five months of utilities. I wasn't aware the utilities were not being paid, because I have everything on auto-pay and a total of five accounts because I own businesses with multiple locations.

When I get my rent, I am also being invoiced now for over $1500 in utilities which includes their ""service fees"". 

1. I have no contract with these people, they did not have my consent to take utilities in their name. They are the owners of the property, so they don't need my consent, I understand that.
2. Why would I have to pay some third party for services I did not request, nor consented to.
3. Again, I have no current contract with the company that is managing the property, we are using the previous lease agreement. I have no obligation of indemnity.

I don't like this company, they have been terrible to work with, so I am basically thinking of telling them to kick rocks. What am I missing here? I have nothing signed with them, so not sure how I could possibly be liable for utilities they took away from me, and then turn around to charge me for the utilities plus additional fees.

205,NYC - Tenant Issue - Landlord is failing to enforce lease agreement,11aagbh,"First off, thank you for taking the time to read and respond to this. 

We moved into our apartment in NYC in October of 2023. As we were moving in, we were contacted by our management company and asked that we be diligent about covering at least 80% of our wood floor with rugs to reduce noise as much as possible. We quickly acquired some large area rugs and have closer to 90% of our living square footage covered. 

Our building has really thick walls, but very thin floors and ceilings. From the first week in our new apartment, we had our neighbor below us banging on the ceiling, blaring music in retaliation for coming home late from dinner, and eventually accosting my partner in the hallway. I told him to stop coming to our door and that if he needed to communicate with us to do so through the management company. A few weeks later, when I was working at night, he called the police on my partner claiming she was having a party when she was home alone and watching tv. We always watch tv with the volume low and the subtitles on so we don't disturb anyone (hopefully.) We let our management company know that it was starting to feel like harassment. 

They apologized and said they would address it. For a while everything seemed fine...but starting last week, he started blaring music for anywhere from 6-12 hours a day. I tried not to let it bother me (I work from home) but some days it was driving me mad. My partner found that in our lease it prohibits anyone from playing music or the tv loud enough to disturb neighbors. We pointed that out to them and asked that they address it. 

For context, he used to complain and harass the 90-year-old woman that used to live in our apartment before. He has also been in the building for 30+ years and is in a rent-controlled apartment.

If our landlord fails to get our neighbor's actions under control, can we take our landlord to court?",quietalker,2,2,1.0
206,Possible repercussions for an illigal sublet?,11aadur,"I'm in Washington and live in a large rental apartment building. I am going to be away for 4 months and found someone online to sublet my place in the mean time. I just read my lease right now and see that it doesn't really allow subleasing (it says I can with consent but I've heard from others they will just reject all requests). So I suppose subletting would be in violation of my lease. The subletter I found online seems pretty legit with a stable job and good references. Now, I'm wondering ... legally, what's the worst that can happen if I sublet my place anyways? 

Can I have criminal charges filed against me or be arrested?
Can the building sue me for an ungodly amount of money (provided there is no damage from the subletter).

207,"Employer reduced hourly pay rate from $15 to minimum wage after first two paychecks, most likely also withholding/stealing tips.",11aadnt,"A coffee shop attached to a bar/restaurant in Texas hired me at an hourly rate of $15 plus tips. My first paycheck for an hour of training was roughly $14 after taxes. My next paycheck was also at an hourly rate of $15, roughly 28 hours with a net pay of $367. For whatever reason, the tips were not added onto this paycheck. I, stupidly, figured this was some sort of oversight and notified my managers. They all gave me the run around until the next pay period and told me they cut me a check for the tips. It mysteriously disappeared. Of course.

My next paycheck had an hourly rate of $7.25, more than a 50% decrease. The tips were added onto the check for this pay period. With the tips added, it equaled to a hourly rate of, you guessed it, $15 (net pay of roughly $514 for almost 40 hours). I notified my manager of this and he told me that the ""minimum hourly pay with tips"" will be $15. He then had the gall to tell me it would have been $23 an hour if my hourly pay wasn't reduced to minimum wage. And that's what I can ""potentially"" make with the reduced hourly pay. Interesting.

I then demanded for the dozenth time the tips from the prior pay period. After making me work/wait for at least another hour, they cut me a check for roughly $60 which equated to roughly an extra $2 an hour for the prior pay period. At this point, I'd had enough of their garbage and clocked out and walked out. Bullshit.

From my basic understanding of labor laws, this is textbook wage theft. I was never informed in any way of the hourly pay decrease after the first pay two periods. They are almost certainly withholding or stealing tips. My tips per hour increased fourfold after decreasing my hourly pay by more than half. Quite peculiar.

 my family is living in a two-floor apartment and our renewed lease will end in July 2024.

Our apartment's main floor (living room and kitchen) flooded twice last year. The first time the toilet pipe bursted due to age, and the second time, the laundry pipe bursted in December because of cold (we had heat on at all times). None are at our fault.

[Current situation]
Our property manager and landlord had someone to inspect the main floor, and they said the areas are reading wet and microbial growth has been discovered. The mitigation/remediation will take 6 to 8 months, and there will not be a functioning kitchen and living area. 

Our landlord asks us to vacate the property as soon as possible. She said the lease and the renwal will be voided when we move out the unit and she doesn't foresee tenants are able to move back into the unit  after mitigation and main floor demo. We assume she  wants to break the lease. So far, she's just willing to return our deposit and will not provide any housing accommodation or compensation. The owner 

We understand that mold growth is health hazardous, and we also want to move out as we can. However, we have many furniture and belongings to move.

215,Landlord Keeping “Prorated” Rent,11a9ngm,"So I moved into a townhouse with a roommate in August.
We did not move in at the beginning of the month due to some repairs needed, and so moved in the 19th. Our rent was prorated for that month, so we paid the amount calculated “per day” that we spent in the unit.

The lease was for a year. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to move out after 6 months. I found a replacement tenant and cleared everything with my landlord and was free and clear as of January 21st, when the new tenant moved in and I was told I would be getting my security deposit returned.

Today the deposit finally showed up (late, and after reminders to the landlord about it).

However, I did not have the money returned for the time that I was not living in the townhome.

When I asked my landlord about it, (since she was insistent upon prorating me/us when we moved in) questioning why I didn’t receive the money for the time I spent not living at the unit (I had already paid rent for the month).

My landlord replied:

Since (I) got out of the lease early by finding a replacement tenant, it’s something I would have had to work out with the replacement tenant, who she did not charge for that week so as it to not double charge.

Is this legal?
I see nothing about this in my former lease.

They have been telling people that I have a non-compete but I never signed one. I started in 2015 and they tried to have me sign one in 2017 when they brought on the second employee. I told them I couldn’t because I still was a W2 employee for my parents company which they hired me from and even though I only did their payroll that would put me in breach.

First day on the job, I was introduced as a Manager of sorts to all the teams, and this continues to be my title.

I believe I was hired as a Marketing Manager due to medium salary being way below market average compared to Manager in the same field (40k less). Is this legal? Will I have any issues if I switch jobs and say my current title and not what is on my contract?

236,Old Leasing Agency Mistakenly Sent Us to Collections,11a8ffu,"In Chicago Illinois.

Our old leasing agency incorrectly charged us for an extra month of rent on top of a few other charges and we called and emailed them to remove the charges last fall, in which they responded and said they would but never did.

They then emailed us in November with a bill that still had the incorrect charges on it and said we must pay by Nov. 14th to avoid being sent to collections. We went to their office to get the incorrect charges removed on Nov. 14th, and the was a remaining balance of $300 for move-out fees after they removed them. We sent them a check and gave them the payment confirmation for the check on Nov. 14th when we went to the office for the remaining balance. On Nov. 15th they sent us to collections, despite when we were in office they said all they needed was the payment confirmation on the 14th to avoid being sent. The check was sent out on Nov. 15th and the balance was paid.

We only recently found out they sent us to collections, and called them and they said they removed the incorrect charges in September (which cannot be true on our end since they sent us a bill in Nov which still had the incorrect charges on it which is why we went to the office). They said they sent us to collections on Nov. 15th and the bill was paid to them on Nov. 21st. We went again into the office and the accountant said he mistakenly sent us to collections and he cancelled the collection with the agency he reported us to. We also emailed him afterwards in which he informed us he cancelled the collection and we called and on the phone he said he mistakenly reported us.

The collection agency has reported us the credit bureaus also which is how we found out we were sent to collections in the first place since it showed up on our credit reports. The leasing agency and collections agency says we now must file a dispute with the credit bureaus ourselves to get in removed from our reports.

My main issues/questions are:

1) Since the collection has been cancelled, will this be completely removed from our reports?

2) How will we ensure the credit bureaus know this was a mistake and will take it off our accounts? 

3) Is there any way to have the collections agency inform the credit bureaus?

4) Is there a way to report our leasing agency for mistakenly sending us to collections?",fuzzyblanket19,0,1,1.0

241,Some stole the check meant for my landlord out of the mail and cashed it.,11a87px,"So I dropped off my rent check at the post office on Monday, Presidents’ Day. It was around 5pm and I dropped it in the blue collection bin outside of USPS (never again). My landlord only lives 5 or so miles away but I figured easiest to just drop it as USPS. 

I logged into my bank account today and noticed it had already been cashed and my account was debited the $4k. I thought it was strange that the check was cashed so quickly because this was for March rent but I suppose it was possible the landlord got and cashed it right away. But I had a bad feeling so I called him. He has been traveling and neither he or his wife received or cash any check. So I log into my bank account and I see a very strange signature on the check that doesn’t match his previous signature on checks (not even close). What is weird is that nothing was changed on the deposited check, the check wasn’t washed, but the signature on the back most definitely did not match the name I wrote on the front of the check. Also, the check was cashed the very next day after I dropped it in the mail. So that means between 5pm on Monday and 5pm on Tuesday, some stole it and cashed it. I’m guessing some likely stole it out of the blue collection box. 

I called my bank and reported the fraud. And I called USPS and reported what happened. They are both investigating. In the meantime, I’ve frozen my bank account and in the process of opening up a new one with the same bank. 

I’m wondering if 1) I will get my money back. I’m in Florida and I know state laws vary. 2) is there anything else I should be doing? Should I file a police report? Should I be freezing my credit? And 3) shouldn’t the bank be able to tell me who cashed the check? They said it was a mobile deposit but I don’t get how it was allowed to clear with an account that almost certainly didn’t match the name on the check.

243,Home Buy Out / Equitable Distribution question (New Jersey),11a86ho,"Hello, just joined reddit today, I did read the rules and will try my best to adhere to them.

My situation is this, GF and I (not married) both in our 50s and been dating for 15 years (each had one divorce in our past).   First 10 years was long distance, 60 miles apart, only saw each other on the weekends, and we were both fully employed and maintained separate residences independently (her an apartment, I owned my house).   It was a great 10 years.   

5 years ago, I bought a lake house in north NJ and she agreed to leave her job in NYC and move up.  I had inherited money when my father died 2 years earlier, and paid for the house (440K) outright and in cash, no mortgage.  She did not contribute at all financially.  However, I did put her name on the deed.  I did this for two reasons, first, she left her job a few months after moving up (this was planned) and wanted to make a career change, and I wanted her to have the security that if anything happened to me, the house would be hers, and not go to my kids (they would get plenty from other sources).  Second, she left her job, her apartment, everything to move up with me, and I wanted her to not worry that I would just kick her to the curb and she would have nothing (not that I would ever do that).

Well the last 5 years has not gone well, and we've decided to split.  During the 5 years we combined finances, but I brought in about 85% of all money for living expenses, etc.  She was making a career change and not earning a lot, and I've averaged about 200K per year during the 5 years.   Also since I bought the house, I have bought her and her son each cars for about 20K each, and I also paid for her son's college, he only went for 3 semesters then dropped out, but it did cost me about 55K in cash.   Nothing from her, or her son's father.  Not sure if any of this other stuff matters, just figured I would mention it. 

So now we need to figure out a buyout.  House is probably worth 600K now.  I have always thought that something like 125 - 150K from me would be fair and will gladly pay that, knowing i am more than making up for the risk she took.   She is asking for 220K (1/2 the purchase price), and seems to think she is entitled to 1/2 the current value.  I hope we can agree on something, but i am looking for opinions from people who know about this stuff, if we had to lawyer up and this went to court, how would this be determined?  What factors are used to determine the ""equitable distribution""?  I don't want it to go to court, because I truly still care for her (breakup is mostly her decision) and know if we lawyer up we'll wind up hating each other like all divorced people.   

I did have one consultation with a lawyer, who agreed that 220K seemed like too much, but of course would not really comment on what would likely happen if it wound up in court, or how these decisions are rendered by judges.  

FYI - I have already paid her 75K (yes I had her sign a payment receipt stating its for the buyout of the house), but for me to come up with the remaining 145K she wants I would have to take a line of credit on the house, I have no other liquid funds available, so this will hurt, I am not filthy rich.

245,Help! I’m being contacted by an insurance subrogation collector!,11a837n,"(Illinois)

So on my birthday, I loaned my car to a friend to run to my house and back. On the way there, he rear-ended a car in stop-and-go traffic. He exchanged information with the lady. They didn’t call the police. 

There wasn't much damage done to my car either but I filled out a police report and an insurance claim the next day. My insurance company deemed its total loss and six months later, they gave me a check for my car, which I used as a down payment for another car. 

Fast forward to today, I am being contacted by an insurance subrogation collector from another state who says I have been named the responsible party by their client State Farm Mutual for the damages against their insured’s property. The letter states that State Farm has paid $18953.68 on behalf of their insured and has assigned this claim to their office to pursue collections against me. 

The letter continues by saying, ‘Based on the Financial Responsibility Laws of your state if the damages were due to the operation of a motor, you were the owner of the vehicle, then any request for claim verification may not prevent possible suspension driver's license and removal of your vehicle license plate registration.’

So I contacted the collection service over the phone to inform them I had insurance at the time of the accident. 

Allegedly, and I don’t believe this, the impact from my car (car A) hitting the car in front of him (car B) caused car B to hit the car in front of her (car C), who fled the scene without exchanging information and from car C is where this claim originated from. 

When told I had insurance at the time of the accident, they told me my insurance company (who is no longer my insurance company because they were abysmally slow at approving my claim and issuing a check) denied their claim saying the person I loaned my car to license was expired. 

I asked the lady on the phone to provide me with the police report because this situation offers many unanswered questions, and she said she’d send it to my email by tomorrow. 

I will send a certified letter to the collection agency verifying their status to collect debts in Illinois and disputing this debt as valid.  

My question is, what does ‘if the damages were due to the operation of a motor you were the owner of the vehicle, then any request for claim verification may not prevent possible suspension driver's license and removal of your vehicle license plate registration.’ mean and do I have to be worried about them suspending my license without a court order?

At the time I lived in Missouri, I moved a year or two after and ended up in New Jersey and have been here since. The bank filed a suit against me in the state of NJ but at an airbnb I had lived at in 2016 for a week. The airbnb did not return regular mail but certified mail was unclaimed, so in 2018 when they filed the case, it count as service and a default judgement was entered against me. in 2022 I found out when they tried to garnish my wages and I was able to vacate the default judgement. The trial begins in April.

The first thing I want to do is file for a summary judgement but I want to make sure I argue the right points. 

1) When I asked for a signed copy of cardmember agreement, bank only gave a generic 2016 cardmember agreement that does not contain my information. 

2) The bank when asked has not released any due diligence if any they did to find the airbnb address. 

The main points I want to argue so far are, statute of limitations has expired since even though they brought the suit in time, they did no due diligence to make sure I receive a fair trial and there seems to be a Supreme Court case law on this that I am unable to find anymore.

Second point is jurisdiction, the entire time I had the card I was in Missouri and the statements reflect that. The governing law for Discover is state of Delaware, so state of New Jersey shouldn't have jurisdiction in the first place.

248,Apartment charging me extra 2 days rent after vacating - Austin TX,11a81op,"I recently moved apartments, vacating my previous apartment on January 1st, at the end of my lease. My apartment charged me rent and utilities/amenities through January 3rd because they say I didn't tell them I moved out. 

The complication here is that the office was closed on the first for new years day. Prior to the move out I provided my notice of intent to vacate on the 1st 2 months in advance as required, and the last business day prior to the move out date I received a phone call from management where I confirmed again I would be out on the 1st. They told me I could leave my key, fob, car tag, etc in a kitchen drawer, lock the door with the spare, and discard the spare since the office would be closed. 

I said I would do that, and I did. Then a few weeks after vacating I got my final bill including rent/utilities etc prorated through the 3rd instead of the 1st. I called the apartment office and they say that since I didn't notify them afterwards they assumed that I hadn't vacated. I said I followed all the instructions they gave me, and had already indicated my intent to leave via my notice of intent to vacate months prior. They won't budge. 

I followed their move out instructions, maybe it seems obvious that I could have called/emailed after the fact but are they allowed to do this?

May or may not require this context: I stream and had a moderator that i met on the site. After a few months him and i became fairly close. And he helped me polish a logo that i had designed for my personal LLC (I offered money at the time, and he refused). A few months go by and i become uncomfortable with him, and express this to him. After some petty arguments I block him, and no word for a month. Then he reaches out with other means, and repeats twice when blocked there. He then threatens to sue me about the logo, saying i have to stop using it or pay for it, when i offer to pay for his contribution on the logo, he then says that he wont sell it to me or let me use it and i have to send a video of me burning my business cards within 5 days (im out of state for 2 months, so i cant access them).

TLDR: An internet acquaintance helped me polish a logo, and threatened legal action over the logo when I didn't want to have contact/be friends.

My perspective and questions: the logo he created is extremely similar to the original. Payment was discussed and rejected originally. At what point is something called harassment? I know i made some mistakes in telling him any personal information, but does he have any legal standing to make me destroy my logo? I have great anxiety over this petty argument and just want some peace.

All I have is my physical social security card and a photo of my ID and my legal name change documents. 

Some people are telling me that the only thing I can do is go all the way back to California to get my ID in person.

259,"Is it legal to use ""free trial"" over and over?",11a72q8,"Hi,

I live in Europe and I'm using some American website  which offers free credits (can be spent on VOD) for giving out my credit card details.  

I'm creating multiple accounts using Revolut single use (disposable) Visa card to get some free credits. During payment I'm providing made up name and surname since there is no such data on said disposable card (only card number, expiry date and CCV). 

This website banned my IP i guess (i can't log in anymore) but it allows me to use VPN.

Till this point i just thought that I'm not doing something bad, I just found some gape in their system (a lot of websites already blocked free trials for disposable cards) but since IP ban I'm wondering if I'm actually breaking the law. 

I skimmed through their privacy policy and terms and conditions but didn't find any rule that I'm breaking. 

So the question is - am I the bad guy breaking the law or is it legally accepted to continue?",yoxityty,2,0,0.29
260,How to correct a misnomer in a small claims case?,11a70pv,"Cliffs:

* Won a small claims case against a company that scammed me via default judgement.
* The company is continuing to ghost me on the money owed, even with demand letters being sent via certified mail with the judgement and notice of nonpayment being placed in the court docket, CC'd to both the registered agent and main office.
* I was looking at everything, and I realized that the business name was registered as ""BUSINESS NAME LLC"", whereas the case was filed against ""BUSINESS NAME, LLC"". Not sure where the comma came from, but it's likely from me.
* They are the only business registered in the state with their name, and in this state, commas are a stylistic choice and are not required to be included or excluded.
* I think this falls under being a misnomer, and I'm thinking it's possibly one of the reasons they're ignoring everything. I think it's also pretty clear that they are the intended party, and when served, the registered agent confirmed they are the correct agent.
* For the life of me, I cannot find a single process that details how to correct a misnomer (or request a review for correction, or whatever other appicable process) in a small claims case.",OldKingHamlet,4,2,1.0

263,Bankruptcy Fraud,11a6vm8,"I live in Maryland, I hired a licensed Maryland contractor for a project and I paid him $42,000. They completed about $10,000 of work that will need to be scrapped and redone. After ghosting us for months they filed for bankruptcy. I've identified three other victims that have lost a combined total of $240,000. These victims had zero work done. I believe there are more victims from what people are saying on local forums. Essentially this contractor was collecting the maximum amount of deposits and doing no work.

A few days after the business filed for bankruptcy, he filed for personal bankruptcy. My question is how do I become a creditor on his personal bankruptcy?

According to the voluntary petition, it's obvious that the contractor is hiding assets. Which is something I plan to bring up at the meeting of creditors.

Also, one of his other companies is a supercar/racetrack company. It's pissing us victims off because we assume our money was funneled to this other business.

A lawyer I spoke to said they need a $3,000 retainer which I think is fair, but because of the low chance for a payout, I'm looking at other options.

My wife has had a terrible experiences spending tens of thousands of dollars suing and not recouping anything in other cases which is another reason I'm hesitant to hire a lawyer. 

Maryland has a Gauranty Fund which I could get up to $30,000 back from, but the per contractor limit is $100,000 so I will likely get much less if he defrauded many others in Maryland.

I would like to become a creditor on the contractor's personal bankruptcy due to the fraud committed by him, but I'm unsure of how to do that.

I don't anticipate us getting divorced but I just want to protect myself in case we do, especially if she cheats on me.

Ideally, I want us to share finances during marriage but I don't want it split equally. Ideally, we'd have some joint property -- a bank account, home, cars, etc. -- and then some property that would be protected from getting split if we ever get divorce -- so a separate bank account, retirement accounts, separate investments, inheritances, etc.

I've heard that ""infidelity clauses"" are a thing in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, but I don't want an infidelity clause since that would disincentivize her from being honest and coming clean in case any cheating did occur.

273,Termed from job. Signed non prosecution agreement.,11a6c9s,"Got termed from my management position at a location in Winston Salem, NC.
The reason was accusation of theft (redeeming products) even though it was approved by the GM of the store for the entire month of December for Christmas for all employees. 
I was basically blindsided one morning when I was pulled into the office by my agm (who also didn’t know what was going on) and put on the phone with asset protection. I explained to him specifics on what and why things were redeemed. I was then instructed to write a statement and informed of what it should include. I was then asked to read it back and informed of what to add to it. I was asked to sign it. Then I was given another document a “Non-prosecution Agreement” in which it stated how much should be paid back ($1,000) within 30 days. 
I went along with everything they said while being under the impression that it would leave my job intact. After signing, the agm was instructed to escort me out of the building. Roughly 2 weeks later I went to meet with the GM where no information was given and I was allowed to collect my things and it was implied that I’d been terminated. Upon leaving I was told that if I remember anything else of mine to let him know and I’d be able to get them. 
At this point, I have no documentation for anything. No copies of the documents I wrote or signed. Not termination papers. Nothing. 

Flash forward to an officer showing up at my home to write me a citation. He told me the GM reached out to prosecute. The officer asked for a list of items to total the value which was $835. He then asked for clarification on the amount and the GM told him he was sure it’s $1000 of value, despite being informed from the officer that it would be a felony charge at that amount. 

I have reached out to the GM since then asking how to pay and if paying would drop the charges and I’ve gotten no response. Idk if I should be seeking legal counsel or what. I have a wife and child to take care of and idk what we’ll do if I end up doing time. 

TLDR: terminated from job over accusations of theft and was given 30 days to pay back $1000. I couldn’t pay in that timeframe and an officer gave a citation and court date for prosecuting company.

So.. there is a bit more to this question.. but primarily I wanted to understand if I am paying 26% interest on credit card debt.. and about 30K in debt.. but have the means to cash some stock (pre ipo.. so 2ndary market).. at about a 3% hit or so and minimum 100K.. if given how much I am paying on interest.. and struggling check to check right now.. if it would make sense to try to cash some stock in my pre ipo state (where it is a lot less value than it likely will be when we go public or.. get bought out). Or.. just keep eating the high interest on the cards.. and try to pay it down for the next year or so.. and leave stock alone.

2ndary to all this is.. I am on the cusp of filing for divorce. Not asking for advice on that in particular.. just not sure given that I make more right now (she makes about 1/4 what I make) and how it affects alimony.. if withdrawing another 100K added to my 200K salary.. is going to screw me royally in divorce where they will say ""[oh.you](https://oh.you) make 300K a year.. so you can pay x 1000s a month for ever (25 year marriage.. so 13 years to ""life"" depending on ruling in California.. not guaranteed to be for life.. but can be). I've read stories on other forums about some guys made some extra money for side work..and the judge said they can make that all the time knowing it was extra/beyond 40 hour work week.. and had to end up paying way more in alimony. Seems ridiculous that any person would somehow agree that some extra cash one time.. equates to yearly gross every year.. but I guess its possible that judges do this?

Anyway.. I am leaning to just trying to pay it off as quickly as possible.. but it's looking like at least 2 years.. and though if I file soon we would technically split the bills in half.. I know that often.. guys are looked at as assholes if they dont show good faith efforts in paying down debt, etc.. before filing.. so I am doing everything I can to try to alleviate how bad I'll get screwed with alimony. Thus.. ALSO weighing.. adding 100K to my salary this year cashing stock.. to pay down debt.. if it's worth it or not.. and more so.. if that 100K pre filing for divorce.. somehow during divorce means half is hers.. or because I cashed it before filing.. that would not be the case.. especially if it's used to pay off debt that would half be hers anyway.",ta182829318182,3,1,1.0

We live in California.

My dad has cancer and is married to a woman who has one kids, he has two kids (me and my brother). He isn't sure if after he dies if she would leave part of the house to us after she passes eventually. 

He has contacted a few lawyers and some say different things.   
It seems: 

1. there is possible unrevokable trust (which he and she would have to sign to do it)
2. there is a way for him to write a will leaving only his half to us. 
3. there are many loopholes we found out like, even with an unrevokable trust, after he dies, she would still have the house and could sell it for example for $10 to a family member then buy it back, or just live in it while it's under another person's name. 

Is #2 possible? Different lawyers told us different things. Which has us worried because how do we know there isn't some loop hole? 

And, is there anything in the meantime that might hold up in court before going through the lawyer, such as him making a video saying he wants to leave his half to us after he dies, (and apparently anything we do the law says it would only take effect after she eventually would pass).

284,Bought a car that turned out to have no title. Questions about legal process.,11a5mea,"The dealership I purchased the vehicle from is a large dealership with several locations, billboards on the highway, ads on the radio, the whole shebang. I'm talking to a lawyer, but I just wanted to see if I could get a few general answers before pulling the trigger on a lawsuit. I will place details after questions. 

1) Would a lawsuit or arbitration be a better route to go? Our contract states that they would pay for arbitration fees, but I don't know if that's only through their chosen arbitrator or what. 

2) If we won a lawsuit against them, would they also be required to pay our legal fees? Would we be able to add on extra damages. 

3) How long could I expect the legal process to take? I assume they would settle, but I don't know how long that might take either. 

4) If they somehow get the title in, can they force us to take the car instead of giving us our money back?

Here are the details on the situation:

This is in Missouri. We bought the car (a 2017 Buick Enclave) in October, and they said they would have the title to us within 2-4 weeks. It has now been over 4 months. We paid cash for this vehicle. Under Missouri law, we are entitled to ask for money back after 1 month, and we asked for our money back about a month ago. They initially told us that they were able to secure the title, and that it was on its way, in 5-7 days. We agreed to accept the title and keep the vehicle as long as they agreed to pay our late fees to the government due to not paying sales tax to transfer the title, and to fix broken trim lights that they initially said they wouldn't fix. They agreed. We waited almost 2 weeks, and it still hadn't arrived. We have also been checking with the Florida DMV, because the vehicle is originally from Florida, and there are no records of any transfer processes taking place. Then Randy, one of the finance managers, says that the guy who traded in the vehicle didn't pay his taxes and so he never got the title, so they're having to hunt it down and figure all this out. So they lied when they said they've obtained it and it's on its way. At that point we told them we just wanted our money back. Eventually, they agreed. 

Between then and now, they have told us that they printed out the refund check, but that they have one woman at the company who is authorized to sign refund checks, but she's out sick today. The next day she is still out sick. She's at another location, Randy is going to talk to her. Then the next day Randy hands the case off to Ben. Ben is going to go over and talk to her at corporate. He never gets back to us. Throughout this entire process, we have to call them 4 or 5 times throughout the day, MAYBE they will answer, but usually we have to go in person to even get their attention. 

I think that's all the relevant details. My wife is 4 months pregnant. She was not pregnant when this started out. This was supposed to be her first car that isn't a pile of junk, and it's just become a huge source of stress and anxiety for her. Stress is bad for the baby, obviously. These people are obviously stalling, and I'm worried that if we don't decide on what to do soon, they might find some way to obtain the title, and then they will have us over a barrel.

295,Neighbor’s Fence is on our property in North Carolina.,11a517u,"We recently purchased a new build in a subdivision. All purchase documents, the build plan, and the builder’s surveyor show that our neighbor’s fence is not only over the easement (which violates the local HOA policies) but also 1-3ft over the back line of our property (it isn’t straight, one side is further across property lines). 

We are obviously getting a 3rd party surveyor just to ensure we are correct about the property lines prior to beginning the process of getting the fence removed. 

I do have a few questions regarding the process though, especially since these are people we will have to live near. 

1. We are unsure wether we should just ask him to move it first, or contact a lawyer first. I’m unfamiliar with property law here, as we have never lived in this state before, but I know in some places if a fence in this manner is uncontested for a period of time the fence owner can be grandfathered in, and/or claim the property… and I would be nervous that he would do this prior to us taking legal action if we were to just ask him. Especially since the fence was up when we purchased the home, and didn’t realize it was wrong until after purchase. The subdivision halted building for sometime before contracting a new builder, his house is one of the older ones, and the fence has likely been up 5+ years while our lot was vacant.  There is an easement between the properties for subdivision infrastructure that is not supposed to be fenced though, so it’s unlikely that he had any legal claim or HOA approval when the fence was erected. 

2. We have small children, and need to get our own fence soon, and we are completely clueless to how long this process could take. If we install fencing up to his fence in the meantime, we want to be sure that it doesn’t signal “approval/acceptance” on our part, for him having his fence on our property. 

I know we do likely need to talk to a lawyer and the county, because we are not expecting him to be cooperative. (The fence is very obviously, and intentionally over the line, and he has multiple other HOA infractions)… but I also don’t want to start legal action if this is something we can settle in a neighborly fashion, and not burn any bridges.",2McDoty,2,3,1.0

307,Medicare Part A Premium is not Affordable in CA,11a4ex7," 

Hello,

I am 66 years old and live in California. I have both medicare and medical. Previously I only had medical due to my limited income. Last year after I turned 65, I enrolled in Medicare. Before when I was only with Medical, I didn't have to pay a single penny for my insurance/co-insurance/premiums. State covered it 100%. Now my primary is Medicare and my secondary is Medical. But now every month I am getting a $499 bill for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) premiums. I still have a very limited income which is around $1500 per month and living with my spouse. So, paying $499 premium per month is tough for me after all other expenses. I talked with Medical and medicare representatives and they told me to apply for Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program that provides Medicare coverage of Part A and Part B premiums and cost-sharing to low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Later I applied for it and they rejected it just because my resource is above the limit. The max limit for QMB is around $2000 (not sure the amount now) whereas I have $30k in my checking account. All this $30k is the saving for my retirement. I do not have any 401k, no money market investment, no other bank account, no bond, no stocks/crypto, no real estate, no home, and no car. So, they are not calculating it based on the income, rather they are calculating it based on my savings and other things which is absolutely bizarre. Now I have the premium due for 6 months. During the time of enrollment to medicare no one mentioned me about this potential premium payment for part A. Now I am scared if I need to go the hospital for any emergency what will happen? Any advise (legal or general) will be highly appreciated.

310,Assaulted for protecting my Dogs,11a481p,"  
In sum. I was physically assaulted by a much larger man because I chased his aggressive dog away from mine with ski poles. Here are the details. 

I was skijoring with my dogs (cross-country skiing while the dog pulls you- I've done it for decades now), and a common large breed dog charged at us barking. The owner was 100 yards distant in a field below the hill I was on. His dog was completely out of control. I stopped, removed my skis and prepared to defend us as the dog was being very aggressive. I asked the owner to call his dog, to control his dogs. He failed to make any response. I guess he thought it was a fun show?   


A labrador attacked my dogs a few weeks ago because at the time I figured - it's a lab- it's not going to attack, so I wasn't going to let that happen again. My dogs are extremely well trained and I train them every day- they really are under voice control. I'm not just saying that.   


Finally, I'd had enough of the dog charging us, and I shouted to the man ""if you don't control your dog, I will, and you won't like it"". No response. So I chased the dog off with my ski poles. They are carbon-fiber racing poles and shatter easily. I made no contact with the dog but finally it ran off because it saw a person in the field to go bark at instead. Owner never leashed the thing, apologized, nothing.   


So, whatever, I tried to avoid running into the guy by skijoring an extra loop- another mile or so- before heading down the out-back trail to the car. We sadly quickly caught up to the guy. So I'm a smaller athletic female- 130 lbs, not a big person. He's taller, 6 foot fairly robust man. He's on foot, with traction, I'm on skis and the snow surface is icy and slick. So it's slippery which is why I took off my skis when this guy's large dog charged us the first time.   


I come up behind him, and he turns and starts moving to block me from going down the trail. At first I'm thinking- ""is this really happening?"" But then when I see an opening to go by, he reaches out, grabs my shoulder and arm and pushes me to the ground. It's fairly easy to knock me down because I'm on skis and my dogs are pulling forward. I'm a really good skier and don't fall often, but I'm still subject to physics.   


This man shouts at me ""how dare you hit my dog with your poles!"" I responded by saying how aggressive and out of control his dog was or something, as I struggled to get up. The man steps on my skis so I can't get up, and stands over me in a threatening way. I'm hoping my dogs don't turn and take a chunk out of him because that would be a mess even though I was in fear for my life.   


His dog gets into the picture, running circles, barking at me, barking at my dogs. I finally get up somehow, he blocks my progress again as I'm still shaky from the whole thing that is happening. He physically grabs me again and tries to push me down but I scootch around him and then he grabs me from behind in a bear hug- across my chest and breasts- and squeezes.   


Suddenly, my brain kicks in and I scream at him ""get your hands off me, don't you touch me, don't you ever touch me"" and I manage to duck and wiggle out of his clenches, and yell at my dogs to pull us out of there. He tries to grab us but I'm too fast and I'm absolutely screaming at him now to keep his hands off me, asking him what is wrong with him and how dare he touch me like that!   


We get back to the car, I take a picture of his car, and go report it to the ski area manager who is like ""oh yeah I know that guy I consider him a friend."" He knows his name, and he's part of a local rather well-known family. So great.   


I reported it to the police and submitted a report of what happened.   


My questions- will anything happen to this guy? He clearly physically assaulted me and I clearly was in the right defending my dogs from his out-of-control dog- out of control and 100 yards from him. I just wonder, the patriarchy being as it is and the fact that everyone knows everyone in this small area, if nothing will be done.   


If so, what can I do? I'll be carrying quick access bear spray from now on. But I'd like this man to face some consequences. Ridiculous. I didn't even hurt his dog, when it would've been in my right do so. I'm so tired of my dogs being subject to attack from loose dogs when I have trained them so well to stay close and not react to dogs. I feel like I let them down and am so thankful they didn't react like they could've as it would have been worse and as it is at least we got off with no physical scars other than bruising and a sore back from the fall.",Electrical-Court6699,3,1,0.67

Next day I received a text from the manager stating that they again need to confirm the availability.

\- after their initial confirmation that the stone is available,

\- **do they have to honor the pricing and provide me with a similar stone (carat, cut, color, ...)** ?

315,Fine from landlord,11a42pb,"Hoping I can get some guidance. My wife and I are currently renting a 2 bedroom in Oklahoma. Starting last month landlord sent notice out that pest control would be coming out and that all dishes, appliances, and furniture had to be pulled out. They stated they would fine tenants $100 if the preparations weren’t done. They then didn’t show up until the next week, of course requiring everyone do it again. 


This month they did it again, and again didn’t come on the dates specified, but rather delayed another week until today. 

When they do notify tenants of the dates, it’s always been a general notice that lists two possible days. Despite giving me a “ticket” today, I have video footage of the guy spraying around in the kitchen and entry hallway.

At 3 AM a drunk neighbor crashed into my 2016 Lexus. They drive a 2018 Honda. When he crashed into my car that was parked in front of my house and he ran away into his house. Police said they couldn’t take him out of the house because there’s no way to prove he was drunk driving or that he was driving. Police report has his driver’s license information and insurance information on it. Their car was towed away and mine was taken to a repair shop. Repair shop said it might be a total loss. I still owe car payments on the Lexus for another 2-ish years and I didn’t buy GAP coverage. We both have Geico and I put the claim in under his property damage insurance.

If my car is a total loss, Geico said that they would pay out to cover what I owe on the payments and anything left over I can use towards my next car purchase.

320,Landlord failed to give me 60-day move out notice reminder,11a3v3i,"Hello,

I'm moving out this march 26th out of my apartment and I sent an email this morning to give them the notice that I'm not renewing my lease. They proceeded to tell me that my lease would continue until april 24th as per my contract I have to give them a 60 day move out notice.

&#x200B;

The contract does state that I have to give a 60 day notice, but it also states this:

**25. Move-OutNotice.** ***Before moving out,you must give our representative advance written move-out notice as stated in Par. 4, even if the Lease has become a month-to-month lease.*** The move-out date can’t be changed unless we and you both agree in writing.

***Your move-out notice must comply with each of the following:***

&#x200B;

1. (a)  Unless we require more than 30 days’ notice, if you give notice on the first day of the month you intend to move out, move out will be on the last day of that month.
2. (b)  Your move-out notice must not terminate the Lease before the end of the Lease term or renewal period.
3. (c)  If we require you to give us more than 30 days’ written notice to move out before the end of the Lease term, we will give you 1 written reminder not less than 5 days nor more than 90 days before your deadline for giving us your written move-out notice. If we fail to give a reminder notice, 30 days’ written notice to move out is required.
4. (d)  You must get from us a written acknowledgment of your notice.

Per a phone conversation with the management, they are claiming that the RENEWAL OFFER email sent on December 29th (87 days before end of lease) counts as a reminder to give the 60 day notice. Nowhere in that email it is mentioned that I have to give them the 60 day notice, it only gives me the new 12 month lease per month offer and MTM offer. I also never received a physical written notice.

This made her very uncomfortable baring in mind it was the first conversation they’ve had. 

The next time she went to the gym, she got in her car and he came up to her window and said “just give me a chance we’d have something good together”. She rejected him again. 

Today something even weirder happened which has me concerned. My sister was driving home and this guy stopped in the middle of a pedestrian crossing so that my sister had to stop her car. He went up to her car window again and said “you live in *said location* don’t you?” This really creeped her out because she never told him where she lives. She said her heart dropped when he said it. He then said he’s never coming back to the gym again because she rejected him. My sister was terrified and bless her she’s so quiet and didn’t have the confidence to tell him to go away. Whether he comes back to the gym or not I don’t know. She said if he see’s him again she will report him to reception. 

The problem is we don’t know this guys name. If I had his name I would go there myself and report this dude and she doesn’t want to tell them without knowing his name. But basically thinking of doing this anyway it’s just hard because idk who he is

My question is do you think it’s worth reporting for harassment even though we don’t have his name? Even if she doesn’t do it I just want to do it myself. I’m genuinely worried for my sisters safety at this point.

325,Florida HOA - Can we recoup attorney costs for frivolous legal actions by a homeowner?,11a3nlr,"This is somewhat of a general question, but has specifics that affect us, and was hoping someone could provide some insight.

TL;DR - if an HOA resident causes the Association to spend money due to what amounts to a frivolous legal maneuver, is it possible for the Association to go after them for the costs they caused us to incur?

We have a resident who was causing a lot of issues in violating the rules of our community. Specifically, their parents would park their RV in front of their home all day, multiple times a week, which went on for months. This is in clear violation of the rules of our HOA. RVs are only allowed to be parked temporarily for active loading/unloading only, which is spelled out clearly in the rules. This created a lot of complaints from neighbors, as this specific resident lived in a section of the community where houses had to share some front parking spaces and are right next to each other, meaning neighbors were upset that they had to see this RV in front of their own homes, taking up multiple limited parking spots, resulting in numerous complaints to our management company, board, etc. 

The homeowner was sent numerous warnings that they, for the most part, ignored, only responding once sayin that they disagreed with the rule and then started ranting about completely unrelated issues. Eventually, since they refused to stop parking the RV out front during the day, it was sent to the fining committee. The homeowner was invited to attend, they declined, and the fine was upheld. Fairly standard practice and we followed FL statutes in how it was handled.

A couple weeks later, our HOA attorney (which we pay per hour) gets a letter from an attorney representing the homeowner. While it didn't give any specifics, it hinted at a possible lawsuit vaguely claiming HOA negligence, etc. It demanded a ton of paperwork about the HOA operations and said we had to preserve evidence, etc. Most of the paperwork they wanted was already accessible by the homeowner on the management company's website and they were invited to come to the office to make copies of anything else they needed, which they (the homeowner) did. Nothing they requested really had anything to do with the violation, which was weird. They wanted maintenance records, contracts, etc. One of the things they ranted about was the front gate being broken for an extended period of time, which was due to waiting on parts and scheduling (as everything is backordered nowadays).

As of right now, the fine has gone unpaid and we haven't heard anything since. Whether or not it goes any further is anyone's guess, but my question is what happens if it does not. Due to this person, or more specifically his father who bought him the house, owns the very expensive RV in question, and almost certainly hired the attorney, sending this letter, the Association has already incurred quite a bit of legal expenses. Obviously our attorney has been involved, both in communication to us and his attorney. They advised us to let our insurance company know about the possible pending litigation (due to the verbiage in the letter and how we were obligated to let them know otherwise we could be declined in a future claim if we didn't give them a heads up), which means we now have a 'claim' on our record, which can affect future rates and renewals. 

Now obviously if they proceed to sue the HOA or something similar, we can work with the insurance company to get covered representation, etc., and if we win, they would be responsible for paying any of our costs. However, what happens if they don't proceed and this has all just been to be annoying? The already incurred legal fees are already significantly more than what their fine would have been. And the impact in the preliminary notification claim to the insurance company could have additional financial impact down the road. 

Can the HOA hold the homeowner responsible for covering these costs? While I could ask our attorney, that would add even more cost to what we've racked up so far dealing with this, so I was hoping to get some advice from people here. I just don't see how it is 'fair' for someone to make a (IMHO) frivolous accusation which results in well over a thousand dollars in cost to the community as a whole. I would hope there is some legal way to hold them responsible for this if they decide not to go any further and just used this as a way to retaliate against the HOA for making them follow the rules.

A few months ago my partner discovered his father has been using his CVS account to buy multiple $500 gift cards. Fearing he fell victim to a gift card scam, we let his mother know but ultimately we were unable to stop him and he racked up over $5000 in charges. 

Recently his father claimed to work as a handler/assistant for a production company in Los Angeles. His mother sent us a picture of a “Scarlett Johanson Permit Card” with his name and picture on it. The card was obviously fake but couldn’t find information about it online, so we’re not entirely sure what the scam is. 

Yesterday he was supposed to leave on a “business trip” to Los Angeles. While he was gone, my partner’s mother searched the houses for any clue as to what the hell is going on. 

In her search, she discovers he has been committing check fraud for over 20, 000 dollars.

She's obviously freaking out at this point and calls my partner to let him know what is happening and starts gathering evidence to take to the sheriff. 

A couple of hours after getting off the phone with my partner, she calls him back crying. Apparently, she had to pick up his father from the airport because supposedly the deal fell through. At this point, we’re not sure if there actually was a business trip or what but they got into an argument, and his father became mentally unstable and started hitting himself. My partner's mother got scared and left, and is currently staying with a friend.

I know we need to contact a lawyer, but we were hoping for some kind of advice on what to do next. 

This is a lot to take in and my partner and I are trying to help his mother but we, unfortunately, don't even know where to start. We know we need to contact a lawyer, but unfortunately, we can't do that right away.

We would like some advice from people in a similar situation and to hear what they have done.  

Are there any resources available for people in this situation?

What agencies can we speak with?

What kind of attorney do we contact, criminal or divorce? 

How do we report fraudulent crimes of this nature?

Any online guides on how to get his mother out of this situation? Anything that has step-by-step instructions and sources would be appreciated, neither we nor his mother have been in a situation like this so we need something that will hold our hands, heh.

If it makes a difference, his mother is in her 70s, and lives in the California bay area, specifically North Bay. Both his mother and father are immigrants but full American citizens.

329,Injured On Apartment Complex Property Multiple Times,11a3jh8,"**I'll start by saying I'm pretty sure, due to my apartment lease contract saying they aren't at fault for injury on their property, that I can't legally do anything about this situation. But I thought it was worth an ask.**

&#x200B;

Background info: my apartment complex has no sidewalks or walking paths. The only sidewalks are from the street to the buildings, which are probably 10 ft long. Everyone who has a dog typically just walks in the grass all around the property. The property is on a hill and the buildings were built around the natural landscape, as opposed to bulldozing it flat. 

My partner and I were walking our dogs in Oct. 2022. Thank goodness I wasn't alone because I overlooked a hole in the ground (it had grass growing all inside of it so it was hard to see) and stepped in it. I've rolled my ankle plenty of times, but this time I (22F) actually fell to the ground. I felt a pop, and my ankle was so swollen I couldn't see the ankle bone. After a week of pain and my family and friends trying to convince me to see a doctor, I set an appointment. I don't have insurance, but I'm glad I went in because I actually had a high ankle sprain. My doctor told me to wear a brace, ice, etc. and he told me it was going to take months for it to heal.

Four weeks after my injury, three weeks after seeing a doctor, I stepped in another hole on the property. Different hole, I swear. This time I was taking out my trash and recycling. I knew there was a hole in the ground in that area and I was trying to be really careful, but I thought I had already stepped over it. Needless to say, I was crouched on the ground for a while in severe pain because it was the same ankle and I twisted it in the same exact direction.

Just recently, in February 2023, I stepped in another hole. I would like to mention that I had little \*almost\* ankle twists in several holes in between November and February, but this one was the most severe. By now, I've been exercising to try and rehabilitate my ankle on my own since I still don't have insurance. I was at the dog park, where it is hole central, and I twisted my same ankle in a similar way when I stepped in a hole. I had no idea that hole was there since the grass had grown up around and inside of it. Thankfully I had some time to heal and thankfully it wasn't a full twist like the other two, but I can tell my recovery has been set back again, as I am getting leg cramps again.

&#x200B;

**I'm not the only resident who keeps twisting their ankles. I know quite a few people here and we always talk about how we have to ""be careful"" because there are ""so many holes and places to trip"". I haven't seen anyone get as injured as I did, so I am alone in that. I also know there's a dog who lives here who digs holes in the dog park, hence why it's such a boobytrap. Basically, I'm frustrated with the apartment complex. The problem is, they have a reputation of doing absolutely nothing about anything. They were 2 weeks late giving me a new lease when I renewed, so I know they couldn't care less about me rolling my ankle so many times. Are there any loop holes I can look for in my lease contract so I could make them pay for my medical expenses, or maybe file a complaint with the ADA about not having sidewalks or something?**",Far_Pomegranate923,0,0,0.5

336,Insurance Agent unknowingly failed to renew condo policy,11a364h,"I have owned and lived in a condo in Florida since early 2020. I had my condo insurance (separate from the overarching condo-wide policy to cover common areas) through an insurance agency.

Every year, I get a letter from my mortgage company asking me for a copy of my latest insurance docs. In 2020 and 2021, I took a picture of this letter and sent it to my insurance agent (Agent A), who promptly took care of it and everything was fine and dandy.

In April of 2022, I received an email from my insurance agency, from someone I didn't recognize and without any prior communication, that the carrier (who actually holds the policy) had submitted a renewal offer and that attached to the email was the offer itself, a written request to bind, and a signed state diligent effort form ([https://imgur.com/a/Dfp5Pl2](https://imgur.com/a/Dfp5Pl2)). When I opened the single attachment, it was a blank diligent effort form only with nothing else. I tried calling the sender of that email about it to ask and never had any success, so I assumed it was a mistake.

Then, I got the annual letter from my mortgage company and emailed Agent A ([https://imgur.com/a/nCpO7uf](https://imgur.com/a/nCpO7uf)), only to receive an email that a new agent, Agent B, would be taking care of things for now ([https://imgur.com/a/7hXxGgc](https://imgur.com/a/7hXxGgc)). 

Then, for the rest of 2022, silence. No follow up from my agent, no follow up from my mortgage company, nothing. Then, Hurricane Ian hits. The evening of the worst day of the hurricane, I get a call from Agent B telling me that if I needed any help filing a claim, that he was there for me, followed by an email from the insurance agency  ([https://imgur.com/a/0dY9L9U](https://imgur.com/a/0dY9L9U)).

So I file a claim. Then, a few days later I get a call from the insurance carrier, who is separate from the insurance agency, informing me that they couldn't continue the claims process because my policy had never actually been renewed. I called the Insurance Agency and asked wtf was going on, and was relegated to a claims department where they have been ""reviewing my case"" since September of 2022. 

They have stated that they are focused on trying to get a new policy, but they had issues because there was existing damage (no shit!). Damage that I believe they are liable for since it was their negligence that resulted in my policy lapsing. I also called my mortgage company to ask why they never did anything, and was told that they had tried to contact my insurance agent for 6 months but had no luck.

When asked why they didn't let me know that so that I could help connect them, they had no answer. The mortgage company was also confused, because after a couple months of no up-to-date documentation, they usually go and get me a policy that is way more expensive. They didn't know how my property slipped through those cracks. I attempted to fill them in to the situation to see if they would help me fight this, and they chose to stay out of it.

So now, I am having to get my roof repaired along with a lot of internal water damage from roof leaks, which was estimated between 40k-50k total. I couldn't wait any longer since we are getting close to the rainy season in Florida, so at this point I am hoping that I can submit the invoices for reimbursement to the insurance agent. 

So what is my legal recourse here? Do I have cause to pursue them for the damages and any increases in premiums because of the lapse of coverage? My condo has technically been uninsured for almost a year now, so even if they get a new policy, its likely going to be outrageously expensive, and I think they should be liable for that as well.

337,traffic law/right of way,11a2yw8,"I was on what I assumed is single lane two way street. There were no markings on this road at all but half a block back the road has a double striped solid yellow lane, no white lines separating same way traffic. 

I pulled up to a atop sign at a busy intersection wanting to go straight but decided to turn right because the traffic was heavy. Someone had oulled up on the right side of my vehicle and I did not see them and I assumed this is only a two lane street so when I turned my car dragged across the front their car. 

I had not left the stop sign when this occurred, I had only pulled forward about a foot to get a vetter view of traffic. 

It is a somewhat wide two lane street but the officer didn't even know if it was a two or 4 lane street but thought it was only 2. 

Can someone legally pull up next to you at a stop sign in a single lane even if there is technically room for them to squeeze in? Does a street have to have markings indicating there is more than one lane on a specific side of traffic or does a certain street width automatically make it 2 lanes?

339,Do I have a standing,11a2xx3,"Hi friends! I’m having a lot of issues with my old apartment complex and I just want to see if I have a standing and also if I’m justified.

In July 22 I moved into an apartment called MC. I moved into a 395 sq ft studio apt (middle of nowhere Indiana) for $800 a month . My lease ended Jan 7th.

Two days after I moved in, the ceiling in my bathroom caved in. I reported it immediately. For two weeks, random stuff was falling from this hole, maybe the size of a hand. After two weeks, Maintenence finally showed up, and he did nothing. Another week goes by, and he came into my apartment while I was at work and CUT THE REST OF THE CEILING OUT. The wood was rotten and moldy, and the ceiling in my bathroom was completely gone. I now had a giant hole, maybe 4 ft by 3ft. It was most of the bathroom ceiling.

I moved in July 8th. The ceiling caved two days later. Maintenence fixed it the day before Thanksgiving.

Three days after Thanksgiving, I woke up in the middle of the night being wet. It was around 2am, and water was POURING from my ceiling and directly onto my mattress. I immediately called emergency Maintenence. The water was dark brown and smelly and was coming so fast that I was using my trash can to catch it, as my mop bucket would fill up completely within minutes. With my trash can, I could sit and not worry for about 15 minutes before it needed to be dumped out. My mattress was SOAKED.

I called emergency maintenance at 2am when I woke up. I called again at 3:30am. I called again at 4:30, and one last time at 7am. No one came. At 10am, when the office opened, I went over and asked the property manager if emergency maintenance was going to come, because my apartment had been flooding for around 9 hours at this point. She came in, said “wow that sucks” then left. Another hour went by, and maintenance FINALLY showed up around 11:30am. And when he showed up…..he turned the water off and then left. That was it.

I spent 4 days blow drying my mattress dry. I was forced to sleep on my dingy couch.

The property manager made fun of the situation to the people who lived above me. The flooding was because the maintenance man installed their washer wrong. He then refused to fix their washer until I moved out because “she makes such a fuss about everything”

Yes, I heard them talking shit about me. These were the two biggest things to happen to me in this apartment, but there were def more maintenance and service things they never did or fixed.

Seeing as how they didn’t even apologize for taking 10 hours for emergency maintenance to show up, I decided to re-read the lease and determined that it had been broken. The lease states that my apartment complex will provide me with a ‘clean safe and habitable apartment’. My apartment didn’t have a ceiling for over 4 months and flooded for over 10 hours. I don’t think that qualifies as ‘clean safe and habitable’.

So, I moved out Jan 5, two days before the lease ended. I SCRUBBED the apartment and left it much cleaner than it was when I moved in. I did not however pay January rent. If they can break the lease Willy nilly, then so can I. I did not pay the $200 they wanted for 5 days.

Now, I am fighting with them trying to get my security deposit back. I told them I am not paying. Why am I obligated to follow the lease but they’re not? I don’t believe that to be fair. My security deposit was $800. I’m starting to think I will never see it.

Do I have any standing here? I have emails, as well as call logs and pictures/videos of everything.",erinmusicality,1,0,0.5

342,Landlord going back on what he said regarding breaking a lease and security deposit,11a2qrq,"I live in Colorado.

I signed a 12 month lease for July 1st 2022. Something personal happened, and I contacted my landlord in December saying I needed to break the lease before the term date. He was willing to work with me and gave the offer that I would need to be out by Feb 18th, but pay for the whole month of Feb and forfeit the security deposit. I asked if I gave him more time, until April 1 and be out by March 18th, if I could keep the security deposit and he agreed to that and said he would list the place ASAP and he found someone to move in April 1st, so no loss of income for him.

So the dates of the lease were amended to the new dates and was signed by both parties. I sent an email to him recently about doing a walkthrough and when I could expect the security deposit back. He called me and said that I wouldn't be getting the security deposit back, as that was our verbal agreement and it's common practice that if someone breaks the lease, they forfeit their security deposit. I said that that wasn't our agreement and I got a new place and was acting under the assumption that I would be getting back the deposit. 

Anyway, there is nothing in the new lease about forfeiting of the security deposit, though it does say ""... Tenant may not elect to apply the Security Deposit as last month’s rent"". I was wondering what recourse I have here? I do appreciate him breaking the lease early, but we did have a verbal agreement and I was acting with the understanding that I would be getting it back (I just signed a new lease so I'd be paying double rent now).  Rent is due next week, and I was thinking about not paying and just using the security deposit as my last month's rent. If I were to do that, is it possible I could be sued and likely have to owe the rent + any legal fees?",iDontKnowMuffin,5,1,1.0

350,Can I request my lawyer fees to be paid by my spouse without my lawyer writing the motion for me? (Florida Divorce),11a23cd,"Context: I attempted to go pro-se in my divorce case but a couple weeks before a hearing new information came to light that my wife was pregnant with someone else’s child. In light of that new info I opted to hire a lawyer. 

Fees: I was charged $8100 and had to take a loan from someone to afford it. They charged per service not per hour. The first service was pre-hearing communication with opposing party and the second service was to appear at my hearing. 

Situation: After the hearing I canceled services with my attorney. I couldn’t afford to pay for any additional services, such as a motion to the court requesting attorneys fees to be paid by my spouse. 

Question: Can I motion to the court on my own behalf requesting my attorney fees be paid by my spouse? My spouse has a similar request in that I pay hers, but I was told it is traditional for both parties to do. My ultimate goal is to tell our judge why I feel her request should be denied and why my request should be granted - and to hopefully do this without any additional attorney fees. 

I assume this is something I am permitted to do on my own, going back to pro-se - and since I did incur lawyers fees I think I am entitled to request they be paid despite not being represented by the lawyer moving forward. Is this correct to assume?

Our divorce is still pending but we have another hearing at some point in the future that I won’t need representation for - we will just be finalizing the dissolution. Any and all feedback would be helpful.

353,Condo Assoc. Had Guest's Vehicle Wrongfully Towed-- Recourse?,11a1wnw,"I own a condo in Wisconsin. We have a small private parking lot that includes 4 visitor parking stalls, plus private stalls allocated for each unit. Each of the visitor stalls have their own sign stating that a vehicle may be parked in the stall for no more than 48 hours per 14 day period. The Condo Docs also feature a clause about parking with similar, though not exactly matching language regarding the visitor stalls.

My guest's vehicle was towed after the Condo Board received some complaints about it being parked in visitor stalls. In email correspondence, the Board stated that 

1. The vehicle had been in visitor parking for 'more than 80 hours' within a 14 day period.
2. They decided to tow it based on their judgement after some number of complaints.
3. They do not and can not monitor the parking lot at all times. It is 'self-reporting' enforcement.
4. The rule for 48hrs/14 days applies in total to any visitor parking, as in each stall does not have a separate 48hr/14day clock.
5. The only evidence they have recording the vehicle's presence is the complaints and 2 images taken on different days within the 14 day period.
6. They refuse to reimburse me or the guest for the tow.

The vehicle was not in violation of the signage. I was unable to easily find what I was looking for within WI towing laws, but to me this feels like an illegal tow. Under these circumstances, they could have any vehicle towed at any time with zero consequence. I spoke with the towing company, and the member of the Board who requested the tow only provided the tow form for the vehicle and stated the reason for towing, no evidence or proof was required.

I asserted to them that the vehicle was not in violation of the signage, that they did not have any evidence to the contrary, and that also that the signage/rules are unclear as to whether each spot or all visitor parking in total has the 48hr/14 day timing, and therefore enforcement of vague signage is untenable. They maintained that they disagree and will not reimburse me.

So, my questions are,

a. Was it illegal for them to tow without evidence, under vague signage? Is there some resource available that I can clearly find information on legality/liability for towing?

b. Is it worthwhile/ am I likely to succeed pursing this in small claims court? I have no experience with legal matters, are there free/low cost resources available to help if I wanted to go that route? Could I validly pursue emotional damages or lost wages in addition to the tow cost?

c. If this was not illegal, is there any other recourse I may pursue? As stated above, the Board is able tow any vehicle at any time in this manner, which I find unacceptable. I would like to somehow hold them accountable.

My CPA has been pretty great up until yesterday when she sent me an invoice that was 9,0000$ more than our previously discussed fee. She did not give me ANY contract to sign EVER. Last year I paid XYZ and thought this year would be the same. Wrong. She decided that she worked too hard on my return and wants an additional 9,000$ for said Extra work. She not ONCE said she was going to charge me for this work, all she said was ""this took me way too long and i spent a lot of extra time on it"" by phone. I'm not trying to not pay her . I plan on paying the XYZ and an additional amount that I think is fair, but in no way plan to pay her the additional 9,000$ thats insane, I told her that amount of money can buy me a car, and had I known PRIOR to the work she did that she was going to charge me a car, I would have said NO MA'AM. She then tried to belittle me to what I responded was with , absolutely not, this is not how business work and that she was extremely deceptive and not once mentioned an additional service charge. 

She is now holding me in limbo with submitting my tax return, basically stating that If I don't pay the full amount she wont submit it.

For various reasons, I have legally changed my full first/middle/last name once already, and am looking to do so a second time. 

However, there remains a possibility that I will be coming into an inheritance at some point in the future that will be directed toward my original birth name. With one legal name change, no big deal. Give them the court order that says that John Doe is now Jack Deer. But adding a second name change, and then having the complexity of having to demonstrate at some point via multiple documents that John Doe became Jack Deer became Pat Elk, that is feeling pretty tedious, and more likely to drop red flags for fraud or other shenanigans. (There is no fraud involved, but family estrangements and cultural issues at play.)

My question is, is there enough flexibility on name change orders or similarly that I could get that original name reflected on the 2nd name change to make it all look less sketchy? Something like, ""Jack Deer, who was born John Doe, shall now be legally Pat Elk.""

361,Landlord wants to evict while waiting for rental assistance.,11a1g0b,"Back in July of 2022 I renewed my lease but in August discovered that they had messed up the dates and instead of a 12 month lease had signed me up for a 1 month and then were charging me month to month rates. I brought this issue up and and asked for what I owed and they said they were working on figuring it out. This went on for two months. 

They refused payment because they didn't know how much I owed them. Once they fixed my lease I was able to pay again but for 2 months I was told ""we don't know how much you owe us"". That last month we were also told to ""not worry about it"" and apply for rental assistance. We did but that case was closed because the landlord was applying in bulk for other units in the apartments. We gave them our information and asked if they needed anything else. They said no and every month since November we've received an eviction notice and have been told by the front office that it's a mistake.


The issue is that now, they're serious about it. They're filing eviction on everyone waiting for rental assistance. To me this seems unfair because it's a bulk application. It's on them to let us know if they were planning on rescinding the assistance application before filing for eviction. And if they're not pulling the application, isn't that double dipping? Wasn't it their obligation to keep the tenants informed on where the assistance process stood? 

What should I do in this situation? Should I go to court? Should I just pay them the 2 months rent I owe?

This person(As I don't know a name, gender or anything) then proceeds to tell my mother that she is wrong and that they know this is the person who they are looking for. She then responded again that she was sorry but this is not the person they were looking for. This was on 2/8/23. Fast forward to 2/18/23 this person calls my mother again and repeats the same line - I am looking for (John) and I know this is his number, I received it from another person who confirmed it was Johns number. Again, my mother responds politely saying they have the wrong number and if they could politely stop calling and texting - it would be appreciated. 

Fast forward again to last night and this morning; I get a phone call from my mother very upset that after blocking this persons number - they are now calling off a separate line consistently telling my mother they are still looking for John and will not stop until they speak to him. 

I'm not really sure what to do? I don't think this could go as far as harassment but its damn near close to it. My mother is elderly and very sensitive and all of this is deeply upsetting to her. She gave me the number and I was going to call it a call myself but I don't necessarily want to be involved in some crazy persons cross hairs. Can I call the local police department?

366,How can I have my ex wife removed from our home?,11a17g5,"We divorced 7 years ago and she was making my life hell because I wanted to sell the house. I let her stay there with my daughter who was 15 at the time. In the MDA, it says if she fails to make the mortgage payment, I can pay it. If she does not pay me back in 30 days, I get immediate possession of the home. 

She’s not worked in several years and has gotten in to drugs and prostitution. Now her mental health has deteriorated and she’s deeply depressed, saying she wants to end her life. My daughter is still living there and in her final semester of nursing school. I’m still on the mortgage and deed so I’m having to make the house payments until my daughter finishes her degree (two months). But my ex is so depressed, she won’t sign with a realtor and she won’t clean the house to get it ready to sell. 

I need her out of the home but I’m not sure how to do it. Can I show a judge my MDA and where I made the payment so I can have immediate possession of the home? Will a sheriff come and get her out of the house? She has no where to go so she’ll be homeless. But I can’t keep making the payment, it’s stretching me thin financially.

367,[Canada] Indigenous Land treaty and settlement claim,11a15xk,"Hi all! I am just looking for some advice on this matter, and want to know if it may be worth linking up with a lawyer to discuss further, and as I wouldn't be able to pay any legal fees unless it turned out in my favour - why not start here?

I belong to the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nations in Canada, which was part of the Toronto Purchase Treaty, which was settled in 2010. From what I can find in my research, it seems like the settlement was done in June. The treaty was settled for compensation of $145 million- at that time the largest claims settlement in Canadian history. According to the wiki page and band history, each adult member was awarded $20,000 and an amount was set aside for each underage member to receive the same amount the year they turned 18. The rest was placed in a trust to be used for ""future generations"". 

I unfortunately was not registered at the time of the settlement - my father is estranged and was not willing to help us up until that point. However, once word of the settlement was announced, he tried to get us registered in hopes of receiving the $20,000 for each of us (my 2 brothers and I). I turned 18 in 2014, and my brothers afterwards. In the paperwork I can find available to me online, it says that the amount was distributed to those who turned 18 up to and including the year 2018, the year my youngest brother would have turned 18. However, none of us received any of it. 

I was registered in November of 2010, shortly after the amount was settled. I am not entirely sure of how to read financial records and the yearly spreads, but from what I can gather, the amount put into trust has been turned over and is paid interest each year, so there is still a lot of it left. 

I guess I'm just wondering - what is the likelihood that this amount can be claimed for each of us? Obviously registration was done after the settlement. But I wonder if there is something to say about the fact that I didn't have contact with my father, and therefore could not register until he decided I could. If I had the choice, registration would have been done in 1996. Also, I wonder if there is any chance he could have received it on our behalf. I don't think this is possible, as that was kind of the reason they waited until members turned 18 - to avoid others taking and using that money. But I am not sure.

I am hesitant to reach out to the band personally and ask about this, mainly because I don't want to seem like I'm being greedy or something, and also don't want to come off as stupid for thinking I could claim something if I have no right to it. And if it is something that is going to require a legal battle, I also don't want to give them a heads up to build a case against us. However, at 18, $20,000 would have been blown on the stupidest of things. Now, however, that amount would be life changing for me and my brothers. And if it's not much to them, I'd like to have it (obviously). 

Thanks in advance and let me know if I can give any more info.",iluudanger15,3,2,1.0
368,Landlord has not contacted us about lease renewal and our lease ends next month (April 1),11a1492,"Recently I’ve noticed that our landlord has not contacted us about a renewal. In the past, my previous landlord contacted me ~60 days in advance.

I took a look at the lease and under the “renewal of lease” section it says the typical “tenant must be offered a renewal of this lease unless landlord has good cause not to do so under applicable law” and that if I do not respond to his renewal it’s assumed that I’m not going to. At the end of the section I noticed there was a “see section #44” stating that the renewal is null / void and it is our responsibility to contact him 45 days prior to the lease ending on whether or not I’d be renewing. Both sections are now confusing me.

This is now stressing me out because I was not aware of this. However, you’d think he’d also remind us? I contacted him earlier this week in regards to something else (I was traveling for the last month— hence why the renewal wasn’t even on my mind, and recently got back and noticed I never responded to his last message about our smoke detectors) and he has not responded. 

I know he’s scheduled to have heart surgery around this time so for all I know he does not have access to his phone. I emailed the real estate agent we worked with when touring and signing the apartment and did not receive a response from her either. I’d also like to think that he might have forgotten that our renewal is approaching? Wouldn’t he also have preferred more than a few weeks notice to find new tenants?

I have been renting an apartment for the past year.  The rent for the apartment has included most utilities (water, trash etc) except electricity.

376,GA Speeding Laws,11a0h64,"Greetings, 

I am over the age of 18 so I have a full license. One day I was pulled over for speeding by a cop whose radar read 76. This was on highway 27. 

I was given a ticket, but the cop reduced it to 68 in a 55. I paid the fine and thought I was done, but six months later I find out my license is suspended. I didn't receive any notice, written or verbal.  

Now I have to pay a 200 dollar super speeder fine, then another 50 to reinstate my license. There are three points on my license and records indicate that my disposition was ""bond forfeiture"", whatever that means in this case.

Why did I get a super speeder fine and points and a license suspension if the cop reduced it?  Was I supposed to show up to court? I read on the ticket that the fine should have been paid before the court date or I would face even worse consequences, and I thought paying the fine was all I needed to do. 

This was my first and only offense, I learned my lesson the first time but now I'm stressed out because I cannot afford to pay 250 dollars to reinstate my license. I'm also going to have this on my MVR for a minimum of three years. My insurance is probably going to skyrocket. I can't drive myself anywhere so I have to be chauffered.

377,reported coworker for harassment and he's still working with me,11a0dtn,"so I'm (21F) in between jobs and picked up work as a security officer to have some income while I figure my life out after it got turned upside down. My direct supervisor (30+M) was real chill when I trained with him but I trained for a few hours with other people who hinted he was an issue, but i figured it was a ""he's lazy"" and mentioned an alcohol issue. He seemed super thoughtful and normal so I didn't get what was up.

Well day 3 of working with him he gets flirtatious. This happens alot so I simply thought pulling the ""I have a bf"" hint into convos would suffice to shut it down. It doesn't. Next day I avoid him all together. We patrol a shopping district so anytime he wanted to join me and chat I'd run away casually. At the end of the day, however, he suddenly seems ""off"" (alcohol i assume) and cornered me into an elevator in a VERY weird way. Mind you it's 10pm in a closed and empty shopping district behind the buildings. I'm a 5'3 scrawny girl and he's a HUGE bear of a man. I was TERRIFIED.

When the next officer relieves me shortly after I spill everything. He reveals another female officer is going to report him and I do too the next day during the next shift I was supposed to work with him. They said they'd ""handle it"" before my next shift with him next week. Surprise, they don't. Him AND the other female officer were still on shift with him alone. He was told about an investigation on him now and was simply talked to about ""retaliation."" I was hiding around from him nervous all day especially at night. We also STILL had the same shift. Meaning we both get off at 11pm together and my family escorted me home out of fear that he'd try following me out or home. This is ridiculous and I feel hopeless and like this issue is being swept under the rug.

However my kids have gotten increasingly upset having to leave my home and go to the other.

My ex wants to change their school despite not being very involved in any part of it from assignments to parties to sporting events, my ex tried to tell me that it's only due to them that our children are successful or stable, and our kids fight tears daily upon having to leave my home.   


I want to sit my ex down and ask if they would be on board for a schedule that better aligns with the divorce papers but if they say no - then what? Do I legally have the right to just go off those papers? Or since we have operated differently for 5 years, does that affect it?

I very seldom have a full 40 hour week, usually it's in the 30-35 hour range. They still expect me to be available from 7-4 Monday through Friday though. Is it legal for them to tie me down for 40 hours but only pay me for the hours that they can bill directly to a property?",Thereisnogodhere77,6,4,1.0
393,Protecting a quote from being copied and carried out by another company?,119zg4b,"Hello!  
I am in the UK.   
I work for a small company with 6 employees that create bespoke quotes for office interior designs. We are a small company, going for 10+yrs but generally small local clients. We have had a new client with a huge site and national reach. They have come to us for a quote, we have done a site visit and put a lot of work in to a bespoke design. 

They then told us they sent our quote to another company for a like-for-like. Fair enough. That happens. Since then they have been positive about using us and we have done another site visit, provided some samples for free and provided a more detailed quote to spec. They have been a bit cagey about actually confirming anything though and we are suspicious they are getting us to do all the work but will finalise the project with another company. (We are very thorough and we know our competition are not, which means they of course could undercut us if we do all the work first). 

We are now working on our final quote including all spec, measurements, pricing, etc etc. 

My question: Is there any way we can protect this final quote from being copied by another company? Are there any laws, copyright clauses or other that we should be aware of?

397,person threatening to sue if i dont pay the amount he dictates in an incident between pets (which includes fees covered by insurance).,119zacl,"I live in a small gated community. I ended up befriending a sickly stray and have been nursing him back to good health. Said stray decided to call my place home due to the medical attention and free food he receives. 

Recently, a man came to my house complaining about an incident which occured near my property between the stray im feeding and his cat which he walks in a leash. Said man lives a few streets away from my home but within the same community. 

The incident as he describes it was a territorial dispute between cats and he tried to separate both which resulted in him getting scratched and bitten by both cats. 

I told him that i'd be willing to help him cover the medical expenses and he can just send me the details.

The details arrive and he insists that i need to pay half of the total cost of the bills he accrued. 

For context, he wants me to share with 50% of the total cost shown in his medical bills. Though  it also shows that over 70% of the bill was already covered by insurance.

And at the same time he imposed a deadline when he expects to receive the money, he then threatened legal action if i do not follow his demands to the letter. 


My questions for this case are:
 is it legally sound to be compensated the amount he asked when insurance has covered most of the bill?

Or should i only split with him half of the remaining 30% of the bill which actually came from his pocket

What are my options for defence if he decides to sue? And what are the possible things he can sue me for?


P.s.
 i have mentioned to him multiple times im willing to discuss terms amicably. So i find it unreasonable why he comes to me with demands and deadlines. 

From my perspective it seems that the escalation of the situation was done for financial gain. 

P.p.s. 
He said he is asking me for compensation for not keeping the cat indoors. I told him multiple times that it was an outdoor stray that me and my neighbors treat as a community animal. (He hunts birds, rats and snakes and comes and goes as he pleases. And multiple people feed or look after him) I only responded to him as the caretaker since im the one sending the stray for medical care.

After I left my ex, I moved away for a year and a half and we agreed on breaks and summers. I paid child support calculated by the worksheet of the state of tennessee. I have since moved back and the kids are with me during the week as I live in a much better school system than he does, I work from home, whereas he has to work 6-230 in a factory, and I have my oldest child (F18) to babysit when I need her to. 

He wants the kids every other weekend plus 2 weeks vacation and a few long weekends. I figured out the schedule the way he wanted it on custodyexchange and it has him paying $850 a month in child support. He says I’m trying to rob him and that’s way too much. I sent him all the worksheets in addition to the calendars and my W2 showing what I make. 

The kids are much happier with me, they don’t even want to go to his house on his weekends because he’s verbally abusive, which is a big reason I left him. 

How do I change custody and make him understand it’s not about who wanted the divorce, it’s about the kids and I’m not trying to rob him? I make more than he does! It’s still his responsibility to contribute, even if he didn’t want the divorce, which is his argument. He shouldn’t have to pay because I left.

She did, and nobody responded. She let the manager know and her manager told her told she WILL be coming into work if she can’t get anyone to take her shift.

I rented a van last year July. During this rental, I went over the dartford crossing and ofcourse, I forgot to pay the fee. I knew a PCN would be coming. I got an email from the van rental company giving me the PCN statement. I then tried to use this PCN number and the correct details to pay for the fee. I did this several times checking the information was correct, and I tried over several different dates and times. 

Figuring this wasn't going to work, I sent an email to dartford crossing PCN email address for payments. I gave my PCN number, my details and anything applicable to sort out the payment. I got a response just saying that there is a payment due, and that is pretty much it. There is a part where they say if i'm not the registered keeper, then the registered keeper will send me the PCN - which they did. 

I tried paying this again several times over the next few days, never working. The email said that I should await a PCN letter. so assuming, they were going to send a new PCN because of my email, I waited for a new PCN, which I figured the van rental company would send me. 

However, because its a van rentals registration, they gave the address that was associated when I did the van rental. I used the van hire to move out of my address, so if any PCNs were sent to that address, I never received them.

So I am getting married at a nonprofit bookstore in NYC in less than two months.

We were told on Tuesday that the mezzanine level is going to be closed off to us, the bookshelves torn out and replaced with product from the bookstore’s partner thrift shop thats closing its doors.

The operations manager I spoke to let me know that newer wedding event contracts stipulate that they can change the space however they see fit. But we signed a contract for this venue in 2021 and no such stipulation exists in ours. The ops manager seemed to laugh and told me she didnt understand why I would be upset. Well, ma’am, I booked a bookstore and you’re turning 1/3 of it into a consignment shop and cutting off that 1/3 of space during the wedding.

I argue that this is breach of contract. The ops manager says they can be flexible and allow us to use the mezzanine during the event but the products that are replacing the books will be covered by black tarp. 

Do I have any right to claim damages? The wedding has to happen, we dont have enough time to find a new venue and all other vendors are locked in.

408,Florida real estate question,119ybrt,"Ok guys, I'll try to keep this as short and to the point as I can.  
So. My father (who's in his 60s) lives in northern Florida.  He has a piece of land there that he lives on. His mother, before she passed, had either refinanced or gotten a second mortgage on said property, through a family friend in a private arrangement, and they pay their mortgage payments to them every month.  That friend passed away several years ago, and the power of attorney and responsibilities for this went to his son.  Ever since then, the son has been trying different ways to obtain the land for himself (I'm assuming so he can resell it, because it would go for quite a bit now, and he is a known drug addict and all around douche). He tried to buy it from my father outright several times, but that's not ever happening.  So, comes to last year, the guy tried to claim my father hadn't sent the payments for several months. He, not being an idiot, had saved all of the receipts for each month's money order, and I looked up each one and found that they had been cashed, so I told my father to send that proof to him, as well as ask for a copy of the loan/mortgage paperwork, so we could know the exact amount left, interest rate, etc. (My grandmother was not good at keeping records and we could not find the originals).  The guy never responded,  and we have still yet to receive the information we asked for, but at least he stopped harassing and threatening my father and saying he never paid.  I made sure he continued to keep all the receipts and records of payments.  Now, yesterday,  my father went to pay his property taxes for this year and last year. (My father is a carpenter, and doesnt make a ton of money, and was behind on things due to my grandmothers money mismanagement before she died, and she neglected to inform him about them, so he's been playing catch-up on everything for a few years).  Come to find out, the guy had gone behind my father's back and paid the taxes on it already. Apparently, there is some rule that if you pay property taxes 3 years in a row on a property, you can claim it or something? I'm not sure on that, it's what my father told me.  So he called me in a panic yesterday afternoon, because he thinks this guy is trying to weasel his way to take ownership of his property again.  Is this a thing? Is the guy able to do that?  Also, as an opinion, what about if my father went to a lawyer (real estate lawyer I'd think, yes?), had an official letter written up and sent to the guy requesting all the info we asked for before, and then went to his bank and applied for a loan to pay off the balance of the current loan (and avoid some of the ridiculous, predatory intrest, because while i may not know the exact number, its a wicked high %), so he can tell this guy to f-off and pay off the bank, instead?  And if he can't end up doing that, are there any other options or suggestions that may help? This guy is determined to try to get this land and my dad is terrified he will end up homeless. While he's not an idiot, he is not great when it comes to this stuff, so he always calls me (I live 4hrs away from him, so my help is limited), but I told him I would find out what I can and gave him the previously stated suggestion, and that I would ask here to see if I could get any better advice or suggestions.

We've banned the user, who at the time used IPs which located to a California library, it's gone on since April 2005 non-stop, and now seems to locate to IPs in Queens, NY.

413,Seeking advice regarding possible eviction (Massachusetts),119xsmi,"Tenant requesting advice is working college student and moved Feb. 1 to basement apartment of split level house very close to college campus. Family of 4 lives upstairs, also tenants. Owner lives 30 min. away.

Before signing lease, it was informed that upstairs tenants (UT) would require access to laundry room in basement, only accessible through basement apartment and that they would advise the day before. The door to the laundry room is accessed through the basement bedroom. Basement tenant (BT) agreed and upon moving in tried to set up a schedule during his class/work time which is always in afternoon/evening. UT stated they need laundry room 4x/week and one of those times must be Saturday from morning on. BTsaid this would not be possible since mornings are his only time to rest and enjoy apartment and did not want to be disturbed then, but that Mon and Wed 4-9 pm were the best days since class is then and that 3rd/4th afternoon each week could be set up based on his work schedule, always from around 3 to 10 pm. All coordination between UT/BT has been by text message.

During 1st week, BT advised owner of certain issues such as bathroom extractor/fan not working, outlets that sparked when plugging in items and lights that were not working. During this work, basement tenant noticed incorrect wiring (grounding issue) from the main circuit box which is common in older houses. One issue was not entirely resolved but he decided not to pursue further.

After 1st week, BT’s guarantor/co-signer received text from owner stating that UT was complaining about noise, that BT had music on until late and was talking to a girl all night until 6am. Guarantor acknowledged receipt of the complaint and advised they would forward the complaint. BT received forwarded complaint and noted that the music on that weekend night was off by 11pm and that they were asleep by 2am. BT also commented not understanding why UT did not text him directly about this since they were texting to coordinate laundry access. 

Now 2 weeks later, guarantor has received 2nd complaint through owner from UT, stating they can’t live with hearing the downstairs tenant talking to his girlfriend at night, hearing him use the shower/bathroom at 3 am and smell of marijuana and that BT was smoking outside in his porch area under UT’s upstairs deck on a Sunday afternoon. UT then says that they wanted to send photo as proof of smoking but could not and that if BT leaves, they will rent the basement and that if he does not leave, then they will leave. Owner ended stating they have to let BT go and are giving him 30 days notice.

This is where advice is needed. BT says that since there was no specification in lease regarding smoking and since the same strong smells come from the neighboring house, he thought it would be okay to do so outside in his patio area. He also says that if UT had texted him directly as she does for laundry, then he would have resolved this amicably right away and not smoke anymore outside and has never smoked inside. He states he is willing to amend the lease and add a provision that he agrees no smoking is allowed inside or outside the premises around the house. As regards noise, he states that the girlfriend has been over 6 times in the first 3 weeks (lease specifies that overnight guests are allowed up to 10x/month) and that since the first complaint, he is very mindful about talking in low voices. He also states that he is out of the house almost every day from 2 pm until 11 pm for class/work and after coming home he makes something to eat and then takes a shower (at around 1 am) which he understands he has a right to do in his home. He also states that he is 1 person living downstairs and has 4 people living above him and he can hear when they talk, turn on a faucet, flush and shower and that starting at 5 am he is woken up by them making noise as they shower and walk (heavily) through the house before leaving for work/school and that there is also such noise from above at 11pm but that he never thought to complain about it. BT also states that there is very loud noise in the early afternoons from UT kids screaming and banging about in the house after they get home from school.

He states that when he viewed the apartment before the previous tenant moved out, that it appeared that the previous tenant was using the area for storage because it was haphazardly crammed with furniture and it was very musty and extremely dusty. He believes that the upstairs tenant was used to coming and going from the basement whenever she wanted and is now bothered by this and he says that he also does not understand why she can text him daily about laundry access but cannot text him about these other grievances.

- Natural parent affidavit 
- Consent under oath by adult adoptee
- Final order of adoption 
- Civil case cover sheet for filing civil actions

Can someone tell me where I can find these forms or examples of these documents?  

Also, I know I will need to submit my marriage license and my son's birth certificate. Is there anything else that I will need to provide? My husband is a permanent resident; do I need to include anything about that?

Finally, how do I submit this to the court? Is there something I need to do other than just drive over there and drop this off?

Thanks in advance! I'm on my cellphone, so I hope the formatting is okay.",Intelligent-Kiwi-574,0,0,0.5
415,What qualifications do you need to file a restraining order?,119xnrw,"I’m 17 and my parents probs won’t let me go to the cops.

The messages are like passive aggressive emojis, a lot of them are in all caps with hearts, and long long paragraphs spammed. It’s been such a long time since the ex broke up with me, and the ex still demands contact. This person has been really rude to me in the entire relationship and cheated.

And all that and texted me and I didn’t turn read receipts off so they saw read and kept saying just say something I know you’re there and things like that and they sounded so threatening and I’m scared. They know where I live and I know they will pull up one day with a gun. It’s been so long and they can’t stop texting me. I’m scared.

I was browsing a site (nothing to do with the product I bought). An ad popped up about some sale for air force ones, for 55 bucks.

Fuck up N.1: I Clicked on it. I found myself looking at their page of 15 pairs of shoes? Huh that's weird...

Fuck up N.2: I kept on looking untill I found a nice pair of Nike air force ones. I liked them, I was surprised they were at a really low price. I decided to click on them.

Fuck up N.3: I was so excited I couldn't think straight, and later that day, I bought them (Not a smart financial move).

So here I am today with a pair of fake af1s that came with no laces, In a plastic bag and the toe box is just bulky and weird looking. I have sent them an email with photos of what I received. I also told them that I am willing to send them back if my money is refunded. If the don't, I will send the proof I have to the consumer's protection service in my country.

417,Employer withholding commission after leaving?,119xh27,"My husband currently works in a health-related industry selling a medical product direct to consumers.  Part of his work contract is that he has a base salary and then earns commission from every sale. Because in many cases people use insurance to pay for the product, and he doesn’t get his commission until the payment actually comes through, the commission part of his paycheck sometimes does show up until 1-2 months after a sale.

At the beginning of the month he told his employer (a large company) that he would like to leave the job at the end of the month - not to go to a competing company, but to start a whole new venture. They agreed (after MUCH pushback, as he’s in the top 3 salespeople out of 50 in the region 🙄). 

BUT as he is approaching his last day and continuing to make sales, he realized that some of that commission wouldn’t be showing up until after he was gone.

Company is telling him that he cannot receive that commission as they won’t be “tracking” it after he’s gone. Is this legal, given what his work contract says? Or can they just do whatever they want?? We’re in the U.S.",sqic80,2,1,1.0

I have been looking for a vehicle and found an older one that I like (2006) so I went to check it out. I told the dealership I don’t want to outright buy it as I would want to see if I can get financing for it first. 

The dealer and I end up signing a purchase/buyers order with a 10% deposit to help my odds as I have no history of this kind of purchase. They told me to take it to a credit union they work with to see if I qualify for financing. The dealership told me they would refund the full amount if I couldn’t get the financing, but after reading online I am getting mixed results about this.

Long story short, my mom and step-father are fighting, pretty knock out drag out (just emotionally and mentally, not physical) over some shit about members of the previous family, unrelated so far to inheritance/next of kin stuff.  


It's to the point I'm concerned that my step-father might ""cut her out the will"", if you will.  
Due to some poor financial decisions my mom made in her past before their marriage, she is supposedly not on the deed or mortgage (not sure which one) of their house, which was acquired relatively deep into their marriage. IE they were married when the house was bought.

My question is, are there assets that are automatically hers regardless of last will and testament, as all of the significant ones were acquired post marriage, or am I (because my mother is quite old) going to have do some legal stuff to contest his will and testament? Can he even ""write her out of the will""?  
We live in the state of Alaska.  


2nd question is can he do some shady shit like. Sell the assets to his old family in an attempt to bypass the assets going to my mother? And if so is there any recourse?

428,My ex won’t let me see our dog,119vn96,"Bare with me it’s been complicated and just a lot. My ex boyfriend and I we together for 2 years but broke up a few months ago and I moved out in late November/early December. Our relationship has been complicated since we broke up. But now he wants nothing to do with me. I’m fine with that and have been slowing coming to terms with it. The issue is we have a dog together. His mom gifted us a puppy in July and we only got the puppy because I’ve wanted one for a long time. We even got a chihuahua because of how much I wanted one. For the first 4 months I was solely taking care of her because he worked and I didn’t.  We agreed that I wouldn’t take her when I moved out because I didn’t have a job and my sister, who I was living with, has skittish cats. So my ex has been solely taking care of her since without my help since beginning of January. When my ex and I were still cordial, I’d come over for a few days while he worked so I could care for her and hangout with her. Last month he didn’t want me coming over anymore because he needed space. I said okay and he was willing to drop her off at my place so I could see her when I asked. I ended up moving in with my dad so she was able to come over without there being any issues. Then a few weeks later he didn’t want to do that cause I couldn’t drive so he didn’t want to make the trip. Cut to 3 days ago he was willing to bring her over if I dropped her off. At the time he was supposed to be here he said he’s not dropping her off and this should be our last interaction. I was honestly so confused and I asked him if this means I can never see her again and he never answered until yesterday.

Basically said he doesn’t want to do joint custody of our dog because he wants nothing to do with me. I asked why but he blocked my number. So I called his mom because I thought she’d be on my side about this and talk to him. She wasn’t very nice and said she wouldn’t talk to her son about just talking to me and that I just need to move on from him. Even though this is about our dog like I don’t care if he doesn’t want to talk to me. I just want to be able to see my dog. My sister sent him a message that wasn’t mean or attacking and even said she thought it was best we go our separate ways for good but felt like this was being unfair. She offered that we can communicate through her so he wouldn’t have to talk to me and feels like there’s a way for me to still see my dog but have almost no contact between my ex and I. He read it but didn’t respond. 

So here we are. Even though our puppy was gifted to us, technically his mom’s name is on the official paper the last time I checked. At the time we didn’t change it to ours because his mom has a permanent residence while we just lived in an apartment so we thought it was a good idea. Very stupid in hindsight. Is there anything I can do get visitation rights at least? Do I have any ownership of her? Or is all this dumb and I should just let her go and eventually get a new dog?? 

Also I feel like it’s important to say that as of right now I don’t have a job but I’m looking for one and I’m learning how to drive again. I do want to be able to take care of her when I have her and not rely on anyone to help me with her.",anmlcrssng,4,0,0.13

431,(Business) Former client references a different company for work that I've created.,119v40o," 

I designed and built a website for a former client, creating everything from scratch.   
In the footer of the website, I added ""Created by \[my company\]"" and included a link to my website.  
However, after some disagreements regarding payment, I discovered that my former client had changed the footer to reference a different company.  
This has been the case for several months, despite the fact that the design is 100% my own, with the new company only having changed a few buttons.

**I have proof that the design is mine**, and I am wondering what my options are.   
Can I charge a warning fee, or is it possible to sue the client (assuming a 100% chance of success)?   


I would appreciate any advice.

  
**To provide additional context,**   


I am the owner of a creative agency that specializes in web design and video production. Our clients are highly satisfied with the value we provide, and we take great pride in building positive and long-lasting relationships with them.

However, in the early days of my business, I encountered some growing pains and had a few clients who took advantage of my inexperience. I was often underpaid or not paid at all for some projects.

One of my earliest clients was particularly challenging. I charged a very low fee for a website that turned out to be far more complex than anticipated, with over 70 pages. Despite numerous delays and additional requests from the client, I persisted with the project. Eventually, I reached a breaking point in 2022 and informed the client that there was a significant disparity between the value provided and the cost incurred. I gave him two options: pay a fair price for the services I had already provided or I would launch the website as is and terminate any further business dealings.

Although I did complete the project, in hindsight, I should not have. Later I found out that the client had referenced a different company for all the work I had done and is still doing so. I was incredibly frustrated and angry.

Looking back, I realize that I was inexperienced, and the client took advantage of my naivety.   
As a small business owner, it can be challenging to navigate these situations, but I remain committed to providing exceptional service to my clients.  


Now I know better for the future but I wonder if a can still achieve a just outcome in this situation.

432,I was arrested (booked and released) and ticketed for weed in a recreational state. What are my options?,119uycf,"I'm 24, I live in my van and travel all over but mainly live in Missouri, which is where this happened at and where my DL is out of. Around 2:30 AM, I was watching YouTube on my phone and idling my van for warmth while parked in the corner of the Desloge, Missouri Wal-Mart parking lot when a police officer with the Desloge P.D. knocked on my window. Mind you, I was not playing anything through my van speakers, I was parked directly under a street light, Wal-Marts allow overnight parking and this particular Wal-Mart had signs for no for-sale vehicles and no truck parking, but has absolutely no signage regarding overnight parking otherwise. In addition, Desloge has no ordnances against idling vehicles while parked. My windows do not roll down, so I opened the door and asked how I could help him. The officer, whose name badge was obscured and who made sure not to put his name on any paperwork, asked me what I was doing there, to which I explained that I live in my van and often park here overnight because it's a safe place. He claimed my parking location was ""suspicious"" because it was ""Out away from everybody"" - which I answered by pointing out that being in the middle of the parking lot is both dangerous to myself and frustrating for employees and customers that may want my parking space later, which is why I park in a corner on the other side of the lot from the door. The officer continued to imply I was acting suspicious and that he didn't believe my story, and after the license check came back clear, he said ""Is that weed I smell?""

I knew even then that Missouri law specifically states that the smell of weed is not a valid reason for a search - and that's not just a court decision, it's in the Constitutional Amendment that got weed rec legal here. I decided not to say anything, which made the officer incredibly angry. He then said ""Oh, so that's how we're gonna play it, huh?"" After which I said ""Well, luckily for me, even if you did smell it, it's legal here, so..."" To which he replied ""NoOoOoO!"" (I wish I could properly illustrate his inflection) ""You don't understand the law at all, huh, but if you're gonna act like that, then I guess we'll just do everything we have to then, huh? Get out of the car."" I protested, but before I could get two words out his hand was on his firearm and he said ""No, you're gonna get outta the car right now"" and obviously at that I let him do whatever - because he was literally threatening me with death. 

Him and his trainee partner proceeded to tear apart my entire van despite me telling them exactly where my entire weed kit was, forcing me to stand outside with no coat on for almost 30 minutes - until I was shaking so badly I couldn't speak and they made me get in the car to save face, despite my protests that they were endangering my cat's life by leaving the doors open for a pointless, fruitless search. They found and confiscated less than 3.5 grams of cannabis, in addition to a tray, a childproof cannabis jar, a grinder, a razor for splitting cigar wraps, a Czech tool and a brush I used for tamping down rolls and stuff. Upon telling me they were going to arrest me for what I knew to be completely legal, I began to have a panic attack and was incoherent for a number of minutes, while their attitudes and condescension ramped up even more. My brain entered a trance-like state that calmed me down enough to get in the back of the police SUV and we rode to the station, where they took my prints, locked me in a 2'x2' cell, ate lunch and charged me with two things that are both not crimes in the state of Missouri as of December 8th, 2022: possession of marijuana in improper container and possession of marijuana paraphernalia. They gave me two tickets and drove me back to my van, where thankfully my cat was still waiting and nothing had been stolen. 

I've re-read Article XIV ten or twenty times now. Everything they did that night was illegal, from accosting me without reasonable and articulable suspicion of a crime (illegal on its own) to using the odor of marijuana as a reason to search me (illegal by subsection (10) of section 10. of Article XIV of the MO Constitution) to retaliating against me for employing my Fifth Amendment rights. The only possible argument I could see for any of what they did being justified is if they thought I was driving while high (which remains illegal), but I hadn't even driven my van since that shift had started nor do I smoke and drive (I just smoke a little in the back before I go to bed - which is also a protected activity as outlined in Section 3. of Article XIV - it seems to say pretty clearly that operating or being in control of a vehicle while high or consuming marijuana is illegal, but seems to specifically outline that a motor vehicle which is not being operated is a valid place to smoke). On top of that, they didn't accuse me of smoking and driving, nor were my tickets at all related to consuming while driving or DUI - they were specifically for possession, which is legal - even inside a vehicle in an unmarked container - in Missouri.  Someone make it make sense.

Am I right in thinking I have a lawsuit on my hands? I have nightmares every night about this event because it's the first time in six years that I've been arrested and the only time I've ever heard of someone being arrested for mere possession in a legal state, especially with so little on them. I don't know what to do, and I don't know if I should be scared of losing this case. 

&#x200B;

Note: I have the tickets involved in this case, and was able to find them on Missouri Casenet, but there are no RSMo references in either of the docket entries - which speaks volumes, as someone familiar with the system. However, the tickets themselves are barely legible, so it'll take some digging to figure out the two officers involved.",PheebsDeebs,14,13,0.61
433,My neighbors invaded my home and assaulted my bf and I in front of our ten year old son. What else can I do to make sure they’re convicted?,119uxy4,"In November my son was assaulted by one of our neighbors. We pressed charges and documented with the property managers but the cops didn’t serve him and arrest him until last week and the property managers seemingly did nothing despite saying they would evict them back then.

After we pressed charges his family began to terrorize us. They rev their engines and motorcycle really loud every 2-3 hours all day and night. We documented with the property managers and they said they couldn’t do anything and to call the police. The police said to call the property managers. 

After they got a notice for having junk all over their yard and cars parked in the grass, they blamed us for it so they dragged their basketball goal to our yard and busted it up with sledge hammers. I again documented with the property managers and they just didn’t even respond. 

I have felt on edge at all times the last two months, to the point I started having panic attacks. I didn’t know it was panic attacks until I went to the hospital because I thought it was a heart attack. Once the doctor told me that, I put the pieces together that I’ve been stewing in stress chemicals for a long time and my body is physically reacting to it now. 

Since they got away with revving their engines whenever, the neighbor beside them began to do it too. They would do it together sometimes. Monday night I called the cops again and they drove in about 40 minutes later when it had stopped, turned around in the culdesac, parked for about 2-3 minutes and left without ever getting out of the car. It was obvious they didn’t care so I realized everyone was basically saying it’s our problem that it bothers us. 

When the neighbors who didn’t assault us started again at 4:30 Tuesday morning I had enough and not so politely told them to stop. 

To their credit, they did. But then the crazy neighbors came out and involved themselves. The woman who lives there (daughter of the man who assaulted my son) started taunting me trying to get me to fight her. I refused and mostly just laughed at her and mocked her. I know that’s immature and didn’t help the situation but this has been ongoing and escalating for months and I couldn’t take it anymore. She tried to throw a punch so I grabbed her hair and pushed her head down till she was on the ground. She pulled out a taser during this and was swinging it at me. She almost got me with it as I was trying to subdue her so my boyfriend kicked her once. She dropped her taser and started yelling at us some more. We went back inside our place. 

About twenty minutes later we heard loud vehicles fly in really fast and more yelling. I knew they were going to try something so I started videoing from my door way. When we wouldn’t come out they ran up on our porch, into the house, and attacked my boyfriend. They knocked over and broke our tv. Our son saw all of this.  

They dragged my bf out onto the porch and he disappeared under the three men. I pulled one off and got between him and the rest but he put me down too and they beat us both bloody. While I was pinned down the woman kicked me in the face lacerating my lip all the way through the inside and up through the vermillion border necessitating 8 stitches. 

They hopped in their vehicles and sped away but I couldn’t get a clear picture of their tags. The cops showed up in haste for once and we gave a statement and started sending the officer in charge of our case pictures of our injuries and video of them coming inside. They said since the men came into the house it is a felony. The woman only got a misdemeanor because she kicked me from the ground in front of the porch. In case you haven’t figured it out, we live in a trailer park so the porch is very low so she could reach me from there as I was on the edge.

At the hospital I was given a ct scan and thankfully there was no skull damage or brain bleeds. However I was concussed, had contusions bleeding on my scalp, a contusion over my left eye, a shoe shaped bruise on my upper right arm, and other various bruises and scrapes on my other arm and legs. The doctor said my lip may be permanently disfigured if it doesn’t heal right. He sewed it up pretty straight but there is a lot of swelling so I will have to wait and see. 

My bf also has a concussion. His nose was busted and he has bruises on his forehead, nose, cheeks, a black eye, and on his neck and back. He has various other scrapes and bruises as well, but the worst is his right leg which they nearly broke. It has a huge hematoma covering 2/3 of his calf. The doctors were mostly concerned he will get a blood clot and advised us of the signs to watch out for. Thankfully there doesn’t seem to be any sign of clots. 

We filed the misdemeanor charges against the woman but the cop is charging the felony for the men. My video caught the two men they called in but one of their faces is obscured. One is clear as day and he will be charged tomorrow. The cop wants to try to get as much evidence and go about it the right way to make sure it sticks. 

I now have their names from our other neighbors and I’ve looked them up on Facebook and the only one I can’t say for sure is the one who I couldn’t see clearly on camera. It looks an awful lot like the third guy and I think he’s the one I pulled off my bf. I know for sure what the woman’s bf looks like because he’s lived across from me for a couple years now. So hopefully the cop will consider our ID of him enough to charge him. 

I’ve sent the officer all the pictures of our injuries and the video along with screen shots I changed the brightness on to show the one guys face. There’s no mistaking him. I also sent him our discharge papers from the hospital. 

Tomorrow when he goes back on duty he is going to charge the one brother who’s on camera. While the officer has been off I’ve been gathering what I know to send to help. So far I have the more detailed doctors notes from the visit summary describing my injuries and treatments as well as pictures of the shoe shaped bruise with a measuring tape across various points to hopefully be analyzed for a shoe size. (Thanks for the tip from the redditor on my other post). 

My question legal advice is what else can I possibly gather? I’m thinking I want to write out a more detailed statement talking about the events in the months leading up to it and more about the attack itself, as well as talk about the emotional and mental impact to everyone. Especially to my son who’s been afraid to go to sleep since it happened for fear they’ll come back. We’ve been barricading our doors shut at night and keeping the front open to watch for them in the day with a hammer close at hand. Would it be beneficial to get my son on camera telling what he saw and how he feels to send it to them? Any and all advice is welcome.

Edit to add: There was a character limit on this so I couldn’t include more. But the woman was served for the misdemeanor assault on me yesterday. So we have one down three to go. Please help us out with any knowledge you have. We are intelligent people, but poor and uneducated in these matters.",MyNeighborsAreCrazy,64,1329,0.95
434,Employee made a mistake and now wants us to pay back a debt.,119ux81,"So I’ll try to sum this up as best as I can. I work at a casino in Arizona, and the last few days they have been handing out “memos” to the employees about unpaid dues. Essentially what has happened is that for over a year and a half, a kiosk/cash register was not deducting meals that we bought in the employee dinning room correctly. We can use our badge to pay for food and it’s convenient so most employees do it. When we receive our paystubs we can see how much we spent over the two week pay period and what was deducted. 

Apparently either the payment system or payroll made a mistake and not all the deductions were processed. Now after a year and a half we are being hit with large sums of money that the casino is forcing us to pay back. They are garnishing our wages until amounts are paid in full. 

Some amounts owed are in the low hundreds. Others are in the plus 3000 dollar range. I won’t say how much I apparently owe the casino due to wanting to stay anonymous, but it’s a couple hundred dollars. They’re even going to far as to bill people who are no longer employed at the casino. There was also no warning or notice of the payment system not functioning correctly. These memos just started getting handed out without notice and we are being asked to sign them. 

My question is basically is this legal? The casino operates under different rules from what I understand than most businesses but I was under the impression that a court order was required to garnish wages. Also are we as employees legally obligated to pay this money back even though it wasn’t our fault? Essentially every employee who has used their badge to purchase food at the employee dining room owes a debt so it’s nearly every person that works here. Should we seek legal consul?

437,Car Accident Insurance Debt [CO],119uuhv,"To keep it short, I got into a car accident in July 2022 (in Colorado, USA) and was found at fault. I was uninsured at the time. I went to court and plead guilty to Carless Driving with Bodily injury. Restitution was deferred for 91 days. The other party never submitted their restitution request/paperwork within the 91 days and the deadline passed. I called the DA on the case and she said that the victim could no longer request restitution through the Criminal Court.

Today, I was going through my mail and found three letters by two different Debt Collection Agencies requesting me to pay large sums of money to the victim's car insurance company (State Farm). When I say large amounts, I mean over $5000 for one and over $60,000 for the other.

I am not sure what to do because I don't even make $30,000 a year (I work a close to minimum wage service job). I am already in debt due to the court case and past credit card debt. I don't know how to go forward or handle this, especially when I never even contacted State Farm outside of asking for a copy of the money they paid out for the victim's totalled car.

441,"Spouse refusing to pay rent increase, how can I avoid eviction?",119tpsl,"My husband and I have lived at this apartment (in Ohio) for 6 years. When we went in to sign the latest lease, the rent is increasing almost $100. While I wasn't super happy about the new cost, I knew that our place was still cheaper for our area even with the increase. Unfortunately, my husband has decided it's not right and refused to sign the lease. The leasing manager told us that we had until XX/XX date (not putting specifics) to sign the lease. That date is approaching fast.

I went to the leasing office by myself to discuss with them what will happen. If the lease isn't signed by XX/XX date, it will change over to a month-to-month rate, which means an additional almost $300 a month ON TOP of the almost $100 increase in rent. Since my husband refuses to pay the almost $100 increase, if he only pays the base price under our current lease, we will face eviction. I asked them to leave a notice with these details in our door so that my husband is aware of the consequences of what he's doing. He read it and still believes he's in the right.

Our marriage been on the rocks for years. It's a very long story, but the rent issue is the cherry on top of the BS he's been pulling over the last year. So, basically divorce is imminent. I've already decided that once XX/XX date is here, I'm out. I have a friend I'll move in with temporarily while I figure things out. The problem is, even though I won't be residing in the apartment, since my name is on the lease, I'll be getting an eviction on my record.

Here's my question: Is there ANY way for me to get my name removed from the lease so that I'm not punished for my husband's stupidity? If I get branded with eviction, it will be extremely difficult for me to get a place of my own. I tried to do some research on how to do this and couldn't find anything concrete.

444,Can I sue for almost dying from my rental?,119t3s9,"Long story short - We live in BC, Canada. We rent. We took possession of a new place on February 15th 2022. The landlords were bragging about the amazing fireplace in the living room and how it works great. They told us the home passed the safety inspection. We didn't ask to see an inspection report because we blindly believed everything would be ok... We officially moved in on Feb. 18th as it was the weekend so my husband had time off from work and my mom could babysit our kids. After being at our new place for a few hours, my husband and I started experiencing nausea, vomiting, shaking, chills/sweats and migraines. We blew it off as stress related sickness. The feeling of sickness continued for 6 days every time we were at the house. Our kids (2yr and 11m) were sick, puking, irritable and only seemed happy when we weren't in the house. They were only able to sleep if we weren't at the house. We would leave the house for work, errands and park trips with the kids. I started noticing that I was only feeling ok if we weren't at the house. I did notice a smell of exhaust a few times while being in the house but ignored it at first because the neighbors have big trucks and so does my husband. I got scared when I noticed the smell and the doors and windows had not been open at all.

Fortis called me about the address change and told me that there were issues with the meter and an interior pipe being no longer ""to code"". Fortis also told me that they have been trying to contact the owners of this home since October due to weird meter readings but the owners wouldn't get back to them besides paying their bills. While on the phone with Fortis, I mentioned the smell of exhaust fumes but felt like maybe I was crazy. FortisBC immediately made us evacuate and wait for an emergency technician. The technician came in and tested the gas appliances. The carbon monoxide level inside our home was 300ppm (slightly higher and lower in certain rooms). We were told that we can no longer use the appliances. The Fortis technician said the fireplace has been broken for a while and the DIY repair was causing carbon monoxide, natural gas and exhaust to leak into the house for 6 days. Fortis sent us to ER because myself, my husband, our 2 year old and our 11m old baby were all suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning. We were told that the level inside the home was twice the lethal level and it's amazing we are even alive. 

We contacted the landlords and they immediately told us we could terminate our lease and take our money back. That is literally all they said. We got a two sentence response and they've been in ghost mode ever since. They did not apologize for it. They have not tried to arrange any repairs or compensate us for having no heat (it's -11°C outside) They have not contacted Fortis back regarding the ""red tagging"" of the appliances and the gas issues. They have not told us who the inspector was or what company they used. They will not say if they knew about the fireplace before hand.

Reason I am asking this is because my husband and I are quite traumatized from the fact that we should all be dead. I can't help but feel like they knew about the fireplace. The main reason I am suspicious about it is because the metal frame that was hiding the broken parts of the glass fireplace were held onto the fireplace with tape (relatively new tape- still sticky, no dust or debris or grease on the tape or fireplace). I am not an expert with fireplaces or gas but the frame isn't even screwed on. It's held on by tape. Surely any professional inspection would've found the issues.

If the landlords knew or the inspection company knew and lied, is it possible to sue whoever for knowingly having our family move into a house that was over 300ppm for carbon monoxide and caused my entire family to spend the day in ER. The technician at Fortis BC was very shocked that we didn't die in our sleep the first night and said he was surprised we could even stand after being exposed for so long at such high levels.",TonightZestyclose537,4,0,0.3

I have court tomorrow morning for a property that I moved out of with my now ex and I'm being sued for damages to said property.

My ex and I had a toxic, alcohol ridden relationship and it caused a decent amount of a damage to a previous rental property. Bottles were thrown, appliances broken, walls punched, etc. My ex is out of the picture and all the blame is now falling on me from my previous landlord. I had spoke with him prior to him taking this to court about keeping it out of court, I agreed to the amount he said I owed at the time ($4000) and had started making bi-weekly payments for several months. He then contacts me saying that he's filed on me in court because of non-payment - turns out he didn't know that the payments that he had been receiving were from me... I explained and provided proof that I had been paying, and he refused to drop the case. In the same conversation he deemed that my payments weren't enough, and he increased the amount he wants me to pay to $10,000. I refused as we had already agreed on $4000. I was then served with a document claiming he wants $19,000. I have no idea where these numbers are coming from as I have never been provided with a list of WHAT I'm paying for.

I have provided my proof to the courts that I have been laying bi-weekly for over a year, and have paid nearly $2000 of my debt to him regularly. I also provided our texts that we agreed to keep this out of court should I agree to pay him the $4000 he asked for, as well as the entire conversation we've ever had regarding the matter.

451,My roommate suddenly make me responsible for part of electrical bill,119s633,"I moved in a 2 beds 1 bath apartment on Feb 1st 2023 in South San Francisco. The roommate was already living there for at least a year I think. I signed the roommate agreement lease with her but she did not give me a full contract at the time. I was asking her several times for the missing page and she kept insisting me that it is not necessary because it goes over utilities and she already takes care of it so I don't have to pay anything. Therefore, I went with her decision. I know this is very stupid of me to do but I need a place to stay in less than 2 weeks and I cannot afford expensive housing so I was extremely nervous of making her upset and then losing the spot. When I moved in, there is only 1 heater in the living room and she never turns it on, plus there is no heater in my room. I bought a space heater because the weather is very cold for me (90% of times is below 60 in the afternoon and below 50 at night). I only use it when I'm at home (after 5 pm to before 9:30 am and on the weekend). Ever since my roommate saw me with the heater, she got mad and kept complaining over again about me feeling cold every single time she saw me. Well, she is much older than me so I gave her respect and tried to explain to her that I'm cold but I never got upset or fought or did anything disrespectful to her. But now, she told me that she won't be paying for my electrical bill because I use the heater. I understand she does not make a lot of money but I'm also a student on co-op and I barely make enough either so I offer to just pay $10-$20/month if the electrical bill goes above $80 or $90 but can't pay more than that. She disagrees and wants me to pay more. I never got the page where she explicitly states that she will pay for utilities (We only agreed through text, and I still have that evidence) so I don't know what to do now. Can somebody give me advice?

I know this is a long story but I hope you all can bare with me. I already know how stupid I am to let her take the lead in everything and I just really need some legal advice for this situation.

Last year my two roommates and I had a rather high electricity bill for the summer months, and one of my roommates consequently could not afford to pay so we covered his utilities for the month with the expectation they would pay it back. Fast forward to now and they have not.

Our lease explicitly states that the tenants of the property, not the landlord, are responsible for arranging utilities and my roommate is the only one of us whose name is on the utility statement.

462,Attorney screwed up title - hands off to title company to fix - who is the title company representing?,119r8mz,"Buckle up for this one!

A property owner had a house and a separate office building on two adjacent parcels. Markets and sells the parcel with the house in 2021.  The seller's Realtor then markets the office property in fall of 2022 and finds a buyer. The attorney doing the title search for the pending contract buyer of the office property discovers that the settling attorney for the 2021 house parcel transaction screwed up and put BOTH the house and office parcels on the 2021 house buyer's deed description. The 2021 house parcel contract was very clear it was only the house parcel being sold. The pending office parcel deal is terminated and the contract deposit is returned to the office property buyer.

2021 house parcel settling attorney is apprised of this situation by the office parcel owner's personal attorney and is told to fix it. 2021 settling attorney reaches out to house buyer and 2 months go by and eventually the 2021 attorney says the house parcel buyer is not returning his calls or cooperating. It is discovered that the house parcel owner once told of the deed issue is now telling people looking at the property that he **owns** the office parcel and has put a ""SOLD"" sign in front of the office parcel agent's ""for sale"" sign on the property.

The 2021 house parcel buyer bought a title insurance policy at settlement. It also turns out that the 2021 settling attorney did not actually do the title search but had bought the title search documentation used at the 2021 settlement **from the same company** **that sold the title insurance policy**. The 2021 attorney has now given notice that he has not been able to have the 2021 buyer cooperate and so he bundled up all his work to date and has given it to the title insurance company to get resolved.

So ... if the 2021 Buyer bought title insurance, and the 2021 attorney is turning over resolution of the case to the same title insurance company that screwed up the title documention to begin with, who is the title insurance company working for? The delusional 2021 house parcel buyer who bought their title insurance policy? Themselves, as the entity that screwed up the title description? The office parcel owner?",Nanny_Ogg1000,2,1,1.0
463,Name Change and Motion to Waive Publication,119r3bp,"Hi there, I'm changing my name in the state of Michigan. I filed a motion to waive publication because my transgender identity has caused a lot of squabbling and fighting within my family and 90% of them live in the county that the change would be published in. 

I spoke with someone from the court and they said the reason for publication is so that anyone with a similar name or people I may be indebted to may object to the change. I don't have any friends or family with the same name as my new name and I most certainly am not in debt to anyone or any entity. Other than standard student loans and a mortgage which I pay on time like clockwork. I have an excellent credit score. 

I guess my question is, what kind of documentation or proof can I bring to court to support my motion to waive publication? 

The person I spoke with at the court said the decision would be made entirely based on what I said in court and anything I present. I can talk about the fighting in my family no problem, I'm just worried that won't be enough supporting information.",Soph-Phie,2,1,1.0

465,Custody & Guardianships,119qnr4,"Which court has jurisdiction?

The probate court assumed “emergency”jurisdiction over a child in an ongoing custody case to appoint a temporary guardian, but put a stay on any future probate rulings until the family court held its next hearing. 

The Family Court held an evidentiary hearing and denied the noncustodial parent’s custody modification. The family court judge reaffirmed the previous family court ruling that the custodial parent should have sole legal custody/primary physical custody. However, the child is still living with the temporary guardian under the probate order. There’s a guardianship hearing in just a few weeks, when the 90 days are over. 

There is a local court rule in this county that once a Family Court Judge holds an evidentiary hearing, that court has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction. 

So my question is…

Which court has jurisdiction now? Would the family court reassume its jurisdiction of a custody case it had to begin with?

How long does the “emergency” jurisdiction of the probate court last? 

This was originally filed as a permanent guardianship more than six months ago, and a temporary guardianship has been in place for almost 90 days now.

It’s very confusing since the allegations in the guardianship petition no longer exist to cause any “emergency” conditions now. (They never did, but that’s an entirely different issue 🙄)",_the_ginger_jew,0,1,1.0

470,How can I prove my ex roommate vandalized my apartment?,119qcnc,"  my lease is up to 31st. We both had a mutual agreement that we’re leaving this month. She was not on my lease. I invited her to live with me. (We were in a relationship at one point)There’s no official written paper that proofs of her ever living with me because I don’t know why I thought that was a good idea. I just trusted her unfortunately. I’m in the state of GA btw 

She wouldn’t specify to me what day exactly she was leaving this month. but as I came home yesterday I came home to a very disgusting mess everything can be swept up tbh, but most of the damage she did was she broke the chandelier lights that were hanging in the kitchen. She smashed the bathroom mirror and there’s red paint all over the walls
Prior to all of this she kept trying to intimidate me through texts saying that she had a surprise for, I didn’t take her serious which is my mistake because she is also a scorned ex-lover and capable of anything. 

She packed all of her things and just left. there’s nothing left behind. I don’t know about her whereabouts she could literally be anywhere for all I know. I doubt she’s in the state of Georgia anymore cause she’s not from here. 

I don’t have her phone number or socials,I don’t know anyone she’s associated with etc but I do have two police reports on her and the police have her info I believe because I had to call the cops on her in the past for attacking me.  but other than that and these texts, I don’t have much else.

Enraged is an understatement cause I was putting up with a lot of her abuse and crazy antics for the past few weeks I had left with her and now I have to deal with the mess. 

I’m OK with paying the damages cause I’m pretty sure if I attempt to reach out to her Ill get no response but , whatever.. other than a  police report , what’s really going to happen ? Will the police really going to look into this? How can I prove it was her and will she actually going to be held accountable for all this? What would you do in this situation?

He didn’t ask for the number and we didn’t speak of it again.

I was under the impression he would refund the initial purchase that got delivered to the store- he asked which card I wanted the *return* to go on. I gave him the info and said yes billing address is same as shipping. A few mins later I got a notification that my card had been charged again for the full amount. I brought this up to him and he said yeah I charged you for the second order and you will receive the first order refund back in a few days.

478,Can someone help me with the limits of this Restraining Order I have against my neighbors?,119po7v,"The court granted me a Restraining Order against my neighbors (whom assaulted me, and harass my family). They treat this is a joke, and have been within the minimum-distance of me and the other protected people (my family), so I believe they have broken the Restraining Order on multiple occasions. Before I call the police I would like to know if I do have a case.

Here are the Restraining Order limits:

\* Restrained Person(s) must not do the following to Protected Persons (my family and me):

(5a1) Harass, intimidate, molest, attack, strike, stalk, threaten, assault (sexually or otherwise), hit, abuse, destroy personal property of, or disturb the peace of the person.

(5a2) Contact the person, either directly or indirectly, in **any** way, including, but not limited to, in person, by telephone, on writing, by public or private mail, by interoffice mail, by email, by text message, by fax, or by other electronic means.

(5a4) Respondent may not use third parties to harass/ contact petitioner or protected persons.

&#x200B;

(6a) Restrained Person(s) must stay at least **5 yards** away from:

(6a1) The Petitioner (me)

(6a2) Each Protected Person (my family)

(6a3)  The home of the Petitioner (me)

(6a4) The job or workplace of the Petitioner (me)

(6a8) The vehicle of the Petitioner (me)

(6a9) Vehicles of Protected Persons (my family); Stay away will not prevent Restrained Persons' access to home.

&#x200B;

\- First off, they have already gotten a THIRD PARTY, someone within their circle, to circle around our property and take pictures/record our property and attempt to intimidate my family and me, breaking (**5a4**). I have the license plate number of the third party/person and video of the third party, but I don't know how to prove that the Restrained neighbors are the ones who sent this third party. Would proof that they know each other be enough?

\- They have come within 5 yards/ 15 of my family and me when we are outside of our property, breaking (**6a1-3**). As the victims, I do not believe we should be inconveniencing ourselves waiting for them (Restrained People) to pass along. They should be the ones waiting for us to pass and maintain the 5-yard distance.

\- They have parked within 5 yards/15 feet of my family's vehicles, breaking (**6a8-9**), even though they have plenty of space to park at.

\- Have been within 5 yards/ 15 feet of our driveway and driveway gate, breaking (**6a3**). This is the one I am a little concerned about whether this is a legitimate break of the Restraining Order. They park within 5 yards of our driveway, and have walked past our driveway gate when they have plenty of space to walk elsewhere to get to their destination.

Before anything else is said, I figure I should mention that these people are vile. I have spoken to PI's, and multiple police officers about my family's and my situation, and they all agree that these people (Restrained neighbors) are ""monsters,"" ""trash,"" ""a\*\*holes..."" amongst other things they have called them. My family and I have let them get away with so much because we just want peace and quiet, and to live our lives calmly, but these people have taken advantage each and every step of the way, so now we are here. I cannot keep allowing them to make a joke of my family and me, especially my elderly mother, sisters, and 1-yo baby. I need to know I can do something to stop this, so if anyone can help me with knowing if I have a case against them (even if it seems like minor offenses), anything helps.

Confirmation from insurance told me that it had for sure been sent to my address, and that was when I had gone to ask my mother if she’d seen a letter addressed for me come in our mail.

My mother told me that the insurance money had indeed come in, but that because she became the executor of my grandmother’s estate, that my car was hers as well. She had not informed me that the money had come in, and had subsequently used all of it ($8k or so worth) on her bills and debts. 

I’m fairly young and also autistic, and though it never really sat well with me that she did this, I’m not well-versed enough to understand if what happened was legitimate.

In this situation, what do I do? Is there anything that I can do at this point? Or is it true that once my grandmother passed my car became hers as well and therefore had the rights to the insurance money?

496,MIL is spending her SSI benefits before paying bills,119o22l,"Located in NC. I have made a post before when my MIL was dropping off her medical bills expecting us to pay them. 

My MIL has been having some kind of mental health crisis for a while now but is refusing to get help or admit that anything has been wrong. She hasn’t been able to work for almost two years now since this started, and she has gotten better but she is not the same woman I met 10 years ago. Her temperament and decision making is completely different and her memory is not great. 

This past October my FIL passed away and I was able to get his SSI benefits transferred to her, but it isn’t much. We tried setting up a payee during her social security interview but she got all defensive over this and the rep decided she didn’t need a payee. Now her money is coming in and she is spending so much before her bills are even paid. I tried calling the SS number and speaking to someone and they just said she can spend it however she wants even if it is her only source of income.

The real issue started this month when my SIL paid my MIL bills, leaving my MIL with only a couple hundred for the rest of the month. Well she immediately went and spent the money within two days and freaked out when her card was declined claiming ym SIL was stealing her money. She claims she went to the bank and took my SIL off her account and that she can pay her own bills. But she has never once asked about her bills all these months, like she thinks they’ve been magically paid. We tried to talked to her about allowing one of us to just ensure her bills are paid but she doesn’t think she needs help. We are worried she isn’t going to pay bills and lose the only affordable housing in the area. She can’t live with any of us and honestly with her untreated mental issues I couldn’t allow her here with my kids. 

I guess my question is what are our options to help her? Can we call SS to request a payee even tho she’s opposed to it? She did give my husband a durable power of attorney from the bank but idk what all that allows us to do.",lostlady7,3,2,0.62
497,Grandpa died; Great Uncle moved son into Grandpa's house (left to me in his will),119nyuc,"My grandfather passed away at the end of last year.  In the will, he left everything to me and my two cousins on that side of the family, because both of my grandfather's children (my dad and my uncle) are also dead.  My grandfather's brother was made the executor of the estate.  

I went to visit my grandfather's home (a long drive and a plane ride away) and visit my family (and discuss the will, and what is going to happen) in November, and shortly after that visit apparently my grandfather's brother (executor of the estate) moved his son into my grandfather's house.  My great uncle did not mention this; I found out because his son started posting photos that were clearly taken inside the home on Facebook.  

Great uncle's son is freshly separated, recently arrested (last summer, charges pending) for DUI and resisting arrest, supposed to be sober (and lying to his family about it), and appears to be enjoying his downward spiral.  He has a new puppy that is not house trained.  He has been smoking cigarettes inside the home.

During my visit in November I was not allowed to take anything (not even photos of myself or letters I had written to my grandpa).  All of these things that are important to me have remained inside the house while great uncle's son has been living there (rent-free).  My grandfather's house is worth nearly $1,000,000 and since I cannot afford to buy out my cousins everyone has agreed that the house will be sold.  

My great uncle's son has an active warrant out for his arrest for not showing up for his court date.  

I will be returning to collect the things I would like to keep (before the house is sold) and I'm really heartbroken thinking about the damage (and secondhand smoke) I might find at my grandfather's home.  He died from lung cancer from years of smoking (quit well before living in his new custom built home, never smoked in this house), and I'm just blown away at how disrespectful this whole situation feels.

It is getting closer to being “complete” and final payment being due so I revisited the formal quote that I signed off on and realized that they included items that were not completed in any capacity (paint entire kitchen walls and ceiling) and some that they charged for more than what was actually done (I.e. charged for 200+ sq ft of drywall replacement but really only replaced 60 sq ft). 

I have reached out to the company handling the contractors with detailed notes about everything and have requested that they drop the charges for these items since it would be too much of a hassle to have more people come in when I’ve started moving things back to their respective locations and started to lead a normal life again.

499,ADA Violation or Perfectly Legal?,119nnga,"Hi there, I'm going to make this as short as possible.

I just turned 18, and since I graduated a semester early from high school, I decided to get a part-time job. I have several mental and physical impairments, but since I've never worked a job, I didn't expect them to be as much of an issue as they turned out to be. I work in retail, pricing and hanging up clothes on a clothing rack for other employees to hang up on the sales floor. Although I'm working part-time, they have me working 7 to 8 hours on days that I'm scheduled. I've struggled with scoliosis for several years, and although I can tolerate working for 4 to 5 hours, 7 to 8 hours is excessive, especially since I'm standing for the duration of my shift.

After my first day of working, I went to the store manager and asked for a stool since it's not work that requires me to stand; I can be just as, if not more efficient as if I were seated. They told me they needed approval from HR and declined my request. I also brought up that I needed to work shorter shifts, and I had no issue with working more days if that was necessary. They told me that they don't allow shorter shifts for employees in my department - something about ""meeting goals"" - they didn't give me any rational reason for requiring 8 hour shifts, but I figured it'd be fine as long as I could sit down.

HR declined my request, stating that I needed to fill out ADA paperwork with my GP. After a week or so, I finally had the papers and information I needed to start filing for accommodation. But I can't just manifest an appointment with my GP, and when I asked if I could have my psychiatrist or chiropractor sign off on my ADA, they told me that wasn't allowed. It HAD to be my GP, even though they don't have the same extensive history of my impairments that my chiro or psych would have. So, I have to actually sit down with my GP and explain to them everything about my condition and necessary accommodations. It's just a much more inconvenient process than filing already existing proof of disability, but fine.

The problem I'm having is that my employer is not working with me in regards to my disability at all while I'm waiting to visit my GP. I've been having to take extended breaks and, eventually, leave early just to manage the back pain I experience. They've been docking me on attendance the same as they would if I hadn't communicated my issues at all - for example, I came in to work when I had a 7 hour shift, but I had to leave after 5 hours due to severe pain. They docked me the same amount of attendance points as if I hadn't come in at all. 

I'm close to being terminated by my employer. I really enjoy this job, but I can't handle standing for 8 hours every shift. I've communicated this several times, and they are well aware of my concerns, but they haven't extended any leniency while I'm waiting to fill out my paperwork. It feels like I'm stuck. I don't want to lose my job, but the pain is unbearable without accommodation - accommodations that, in my opinion, are not in the least bit difficult to meet - and they won't accommodate me at all until I file the paperwork, which I have to secure and wait for an appointment with my GP for. I have no issues with visiting my GP and getting the paperwork filed, but it's going to take time, and I can't help that.

I've read a lot of court documents in regard to disability discrimination and ADA violation, but I don't know if my situation would apply. I'm just fed up with being denied basic accommodations and being stuck in a process that directly impacts my health with no compassion from my employer. I've made it clear that I can not and will not work 8 hour shifts without any additional support or changes, but they've continued to treat me as a regular, unimpaired employee by denying me of any form of accommodation whatsoever and writing me up for poor attendance. 

I don't mean to sound entitled and snobbish. I really just can't handle the immense pain I'm in every shift. I try my hardest to stick it out and be effective while I'm working, but I can only take it for so long. So, my question is: What can I do? Is this considered ADA violation? Are they fully in the right to deny me accommodations without proof of diagnosis first? Does this fall under the subject of ADA's ""interactive process""? What should I do??

TL;DR: Employer denying me accommodations until I file the proper paperwork, which will take time. I'm about to lose my job due to poor attendance/extended breaks.

P.S.; On the ADA forms they gave me, it requires me to state my explicit diagnosis/condition. Am I obligated to divulge that information to them?",katsudii,5,0,0.22
500,"Landlord is threatening to claim an upstairs leak was ""self inflicted damage"" to the property.",119nneg,"Long backstory.

So we live in and rent a 3 story townhouse - garage on the bottom floor, 1st floor has a living room w/ kitchen and dining room, and the 2nd floor has 2 bedroom/2 bathrooms.

Almost more than half a year ago we noticed a a small leak was starting to form in the ceiling of our dining room. A very slow drip. Told our landlord about it. They pretty much told us it was an issue with one of our upstairs bathrooms where water must have just been splashing out of the shower past the curtain. Landlord installed some small plastic shield thing next to our shower then sealed the hole in the ceiling with spackle. Basically told us try not to let water get out of the shower.

A few months later we notice a feint gray spot is starting to form where the leak was. We were concerned it might have been mold starting to form so we let our landlord know. Landlord comes by and sprays it with this paint that supposedly kills mold formations too (it was called Kilz). So it really just felt like they literally sprayed over something to make it go away.

Fast forward to earlier this month we notice the leak is starting again. Still a relatively slow drip but definitely more noticeable than before.

Landlord has his handyman show up again who looks at our main bathroom's shower and again claims the shower is spraying outside of the tub. He suggests caulking the tub, which he does, and goes on his way. 

End up using the shower for a few days and again, the ceiling starts leaking, and it's worse than before. Landlord sends handyman over, who cuts the dining room ceiling open in 3 spots because he has no idea whats leaking. He suggests to us again that he just re-caulk the tub. At this point the ceiling has 3 gaping holes the handyman left unsealed for a full week because even though he re-caulked the tub he ""just wanted to be safe"".

Finally, the last straw happens. I'm giving my daughter a bath in the guest bathroom and I drain the tub. My wife then let's me know the leak has started again and because of the holes in the ceiling the handyman left now the entire dining room is covered in water. We had to use a kiddie pool just to catch what was still coming down. My wife immediately calls the landlord who calls the handyman to stop by. It took him at least 30 minutes to arrive and by then the water was still dripping.

Handyman finally realizes a clog in the mainline is causing the upstairs toilet to not flush so water was overflowing through the pipes. He isn't able to do anything about it until the next day so he just tells us don't use the guest shower.

Handyman comes back the next day and snakes our plumbing. Manages to clear whatever obstruction was in there but claims to us that it was ""toilet paper"". Tells us we shouldn't use toilet paper or flush it. I thought this was weird, and our landlord never told us that was a thing prior to this. Handyman finally patched over the holes he cut in the ceiling but it looks really bad and he hasn't even painted over it yet.

Anyways, the timing of this is all coincidental with us wanting to move out and end our lease. Our lease officially ends in 2 months and we've done our due dillegence to tell our landlord 60+ days ahead of time we will be moving out.

What's interesting is our landlord's tone has changed dramatically since we told him our plans to leave. He has started claiming the issue with the plumbing was ""self inflicted damage"" and it could have all been prevented had we not used toilet paper (which again, he never told us to do any such thing prior to this). I honestly suspect he told the handyman to try to pin blame on us any way possible so he wouldn't have to pay our deposit back and possibly claim we owe more due to the plumbing issue. He also told us today ""I'm glad you're moving because I wasn't planning on renewing your lease after this."" He also claimed that we had clogged the toilet multiple times before and we should be thankful that he never charged us for that before because typically that is an extra charge (I don't recall any of this in our lease and any time we mentioned a leak not once did they tell us it was a clog issue).

504,Illinois traffic court following an accident,119ngb8,"I was in a car accident in Illinois a month ago.  My car was totaled and my ankle was/is fractured.  My name is first on the accident report so I’m being labeled as the at fault driver, though I was never told that officially.  I don’t know who hit who, the first crunch had all of my airbags go off so I couldn’t see out any windows.

ANYWAY, the police brought 3 moving violations to the hospital while I was being treated.  One of those violations (failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident) required a traffic court appearance, which was yesterday.  I hired a lawyer and he met me at court.  He was one of the last people to sneak in and called my name to find me.  He asked me if my ticket had to do with an accident to which I told him it did.  He then went to the front and spoke to some people and came back to me to say we can leave because the other parties involved in the accident weren’t there.  And we’ll go back to court at the end of April.

I hired this lawyer, thinking I needed to, because I got 3 tickets, which could result in a suspension and was told he could help get it changed to supervision.

I just don’t understand why the other people involved in the accident would need to be present for me to pay my $164 moving violation.  Am I being hosed?  He spoke fast and talked about getting some of the tickets dropped if they don’t show up and mentioned the word “trial”.

If I’m at fault and my insurance isn’t enough to cover the other parties injuries or repairs then, yes, absolutely we’d be meeting in court if mediation doesn’t work.  To me that is a completely separate issue from my moving violations. Do I need this guy’s help in April at my next traffic court date?

The adjuster assigned has texted me in occasion simply saying he’s still working on it and giving me the runaround . No valid reason for it to take this long. I’ve escalated it to his supervisor and it’s almost as if they’re in cahoots as he doesn’t answer or respond . I’ve attempted to escalate this multiple times with customer service to no avail.

After that it was radio silence . I haven’t even received a scope of damages or a scope of work, i have no idea what the amount of payment is.

510,exBoyfriend refuses to give me my dog,119myol,"Hi all, I am really hoping someone will help me with this here, as I'm heartbroken. I broke up with my boyfriend on Friday and moved out. He had some substance abuse and anger issues, and I set a boundary and moved out. We shared a dog together from day to day, but the dog is legally mine and adopted by me and I am on all the paperwork. I also took care of most of the dog's needs, spent the most time with him, and took care of him primarily. My ex has paid some vet bills (as I have I) and I paid for his insurance and other costs. His dad paid for an expensive training they did and his family has money.

I tried 3x now to get the dog out of the apartment, once on Sat, once Friday, and once on Monday. However, he was physically blocking me from taking the pup out and said ""I'm not letting you take the dog."" He changed all the locks on the doors the minute I said I was moving so I wouldn't take the dog. We moved to this property about a week and a half ago and it's his dad's property, so he could easily change the lock's code when he wanted (there is no key to the lock it's a code you punch in). On Sunday, I walked off the property with the dog and he said I was stealing the dog off his property and got it on video, so I took a video of me returning the dog back to the property as I didn't want any further problems.

I also called the police over to help me get him and they knocked on his door, but he knew his rights and didn't let the dog out of the apartment and spoke with the police outside. He said he wasn't letting the dog out.  

I can't contact the landlord to let me into the property (as it's his dad who is on his side and I haven't paid a month of rent yet as we moved there a week ago), and obviously working with my ex isn't going to work either so I can get access to the pup.

I looked online and it says if he has the dog in his possession in the state of Florida he is most likely to win any court cases despite me being the legal owner, so I am not sure what to do now as he's not allowing me to see the dog at all and has actually gotten quite nasty about this whole thing (as he's hurt I broke up with him) despite me being very respectful. I also am hesitant to go to court because even in small claims court I heard things can get quite expensive. His family has a lot of money and I don't and he has said that he would likely win the court case with a nice, expensive attorney. 

I spoke with the rescue he's from and the rescue is on my side as his a written testament that I am the legal owner of the dog, and should I not be able to take care of him, that he belongs to the rescue. 

Do I have any rights here, or have I lost the dog forever? I love this dog like my son so I'm really hurt about it. I also have no way of proving anger or substance abuse issues to a judge even though he's checked into rehab in the past.",Final_Celebration490,3,2,0.75
511,Landlord offering sweepstakes for 5 star reviews,119manm,"Hello,

I live in Utah, Salt Lake County to be exact. I have had a difficult relationship with my landlord/property management company. Just to give some background, they do all typical slumlord things, erroneous charges related to maintenance, failure to complete maintenance, and near zero communication. As such, they have very poor online reviews. I'm aware of my own failure to properly vet the landlord when I signed the lease, and that's besides the point.

The property management company recently sent an email to all tenants announcing a ""contest."" Quoted from the email, ""This contest will go for 8 weeks.  We will have 2 winners each week, each winner will get a $50 Amazon gift card emailed to them. We are looking for 5 star reviews.  Any 5 star reviews we receive will be eligible to win.  We have 3 review platforms, Google, Facebook, and Yelp.""

I am unsure of the legality of such a ""contest"", as they are unjustly influencing mostly low-income tenants to write positive reviews to improve public image. I have read into the Consumer Review Fairness Act, but my knowledge of anything FTC related is weak. A few more things to note, there is no mention of proper disclosure that the review is associated with a possible financial gain.

513,"Probate, homestead (Florida), and no Will",119mrsv,"1. My mother and father divorced less than a year ago, and my Father never created a new Will. His old will (pre-divorce) states that his estate will be inherited by his Wife, and then his daughter and son equally. 
2. My father passes away after the divorce is finalized, and now the estate passes on to the daughter and son equally by default. 
*Question: Does the pre-divorce will take precedence?* If so, would the ex-spouse in this case be given the estate in full?
3. My dad has a primary residence homesteaded. Is the homesteaded property excluded from the probate process, assuming under normal circumstances (daughter and son not listed on the deed of estate, nor a living trust established), the estate would have to go through the probate process?

514,Restructuring as a potential retaliation,119mn2c,"Posting on behalf of my friend who doesn’t have Reddit

Essentially, she has ample reason to believe that her boss’s boss dislikes her greatly, and has made a few decisions involving her that generally have retaliatory vibes. Her direct boss was recently fired, and they’re restructuring her whole group that was under said boss. She’s been given information regarding a transfer to a wholly unrelated department (which would negate her gained relevant experience as well as prevent internal transfers for a year) in 10 days. If she doesn’t agree to the new position, or doesn’t fine another within the company, the company will treat that as a resignation at the end of the 10 day period. 

The question basically becomes, is there a viewpoint here where this could be considered retaliation, or more likely considered a layoff without adequate notice? I did a little googling and saw some info regarding the WARN act, and this company is large enough to fall within the 100 employee category, which would allegedly require more notice in the event that this could be considered a layoff. There’s some fuckery involving putting the onus of resignation on the employees, which I assume is related. Any advice is appreciated!",squadger,3,0,0.17

517,How to find a good lawyer for transfer of real estate property,119mk32,"Because my parents are getting older, they want to transfer property to me. More specifically they want to transfer the ownership of the current house they live in as well as their place as a beneficiary for their parents (my grandparents) house.

1.	My parents want to transfer their current house to me as they are becoming elderly. I read that an option for us would be a quitclaim deed. It seems that I need to somehow obtain one and sign it with my parents in front of an attorney 
2.	One of my parents along with their siblings are the beneficiaries to a house that belonged to my grandparents who had recently passed away. My parent would like to transfer their ownership/ beneficiary to me so that if their share is bought out or if the property is sold, the money would go directly to me rather than going through my parent first.

Was wondering what is the best way for me to find a lawyer to help me with the process and what type of lawyer should I look for.

518,[California] Home deed was not properly registered upon sale in 2013,119miwy,"My mother bought her home in 2013 Contra Costa County and apparently the deed was never properly registered in the county's assessor's office. She has continued to pay taxes on the property but never received a tax bill to her address. Today, she went into the accessor's office to find out why and learned that the deed had never been registered correctly by the title company (both the title company and the realtor that sold her the house have closed/passed).

Apparently, they can only go back 4 years now and change the deed. The home will now be reassessed at a new value (for 2019), I think, which will be more than double the home's value when it was purchased in 2013. I expect her property tax will also double. She's 65 and expected to go onto a limited income in the next year. Is there a solution here that can force the county to assess it at the original sale price?

527,facebook marketplace scam (maybe?) need legal advice,119m4xn,"Hello everyone, this is a bit of a story but I am so nervous that I screwed up here. I was browsing marketplace for some product and found some for way lower than retail price ($20 lower) so I messaged the seller. They said they are in another city so I asked if they ship. Said yes. Asked seller if i could purchase 2 of the products and ship them. Red flag #1: shipping for 2 would be only about $6.25 for decently sized products. Red flag #2: CashApp. But in my excitement, I agreed and sent the money.

Person said they would ship next day and I said great, but asked for another so I could give one product to my partner. Seller agreed, no extra shipping cost. So I sent more. 

Next day, seller messages me for address and zip code before “going to ship at x time.” I comply, and sent. Seller then messages me hours after x time asking me to take last of the product for only $10 more. I comply.

Hours later, I ask for shipping info. Nothing. Same thing for 2 days, no response. Naturally I haven’t heard anything for 2 days so I suspect a scam. I let seller know that I believed this was a scam and if I didn’t hear back I would file a claim with my bank for my money back. IMMEDIATELY after I stated I had filed a claim and will be receiving my money, seller responds saying they have filed a police report.

Is there any grounds for me to get in trouble here? I told seller I would send product back or repay if product is received after all which by the way, seller claimed they did ship? However, they never sent the information. 

I contacted said police department seller claimed to file with and as of now there appears to not be anything in my name; however, seller was adamant they had filed. Even stated that CashApp drained the money I sent and would take back the police report if I sent it back.

TLDR: Marketplace seller appears to scam me then “files a police report” what can I do?

532,"My wife is having a psychotic episode, authorities won't help. [MA/CT]",119luv0,"Sorry for the length but it's important to understand the background.

My wife has had issues with delusions for a while. Always had mental health issues but she had a psychotic break after getting a UTI ~2 years ago ago. Doing crazy stuff, boiling clothes, was trying to tell the landlord someone planted bugs (both kinds) in our apartment, etc. Inlaws and I got her in the ER and then to a hospital and when she wanted to leave they got a court order to keep her there. She got so much better after being on antipsychotics and our relationship improved dramatically. Then about a year ago she wanted to go down to half the dose. That's when she started thinking people were following her but it was manageable. Eventually her doctor took her off the drug and things got worse (thinking there were coded messages in license plates and people were drugging her food) I eventually managed to get her back on the half dose and she bounced on and off. It was always awful and she started getting more aggressive. In September she went off the meds again and I haven't been able to get her back on. Later that month she pinned me to the bed and smothered me for 15 seconds periods when I tried to argue. I threatened divorce after that and she blew up but things settled down after she more or less agreed to my conditions.

Things had been on and off in terms of intensity but she could hold down a scientific job and function even though she would tell me at night that the WHO could read her thoughts and we're going to kill her if she told me what was happening and that the FBI was going to have someone come by to question us about a CPS investigation into Q Anon style child abuse she believes she suffered. I had a welfare check done then but as always she held it together in front of the social worker.

The last month I come home one day and she is a mess and is angry about me for ""pushing for a divorce"" even though I only did that after she assaulted me and it hadn't been mentioned for months. She was saying all sorts of crazy stuff and I called her parents who picked her up. A few days later they came back to pick up some clothes and she blew up as soon as she walked in accusing me of things. She wouldn't leave without her keys which I gave to her parents but they didn't want her driving in that state so they were going to drive her back. Eventually she went with them but jumped out of the car and came back, cops were called, they told us after that, yes, she was crazy, but didn't have standing to force her into a hospital. I did tell them about the smothering.

She's been down there ever since. After being out for work for the first week she went back and stayed for two weeks before getting let go for obvious reasons. She won't talk to anyone about what is going on and was driving 350 miles a day to random places, wouldn't use a phone, and slept in an idling car untill she ran out of gas in 10F weather and had to have her parents pick her up at 4 AM because she didn't know where she was. I just found out she scraped the side of the car up and knocked the mirror off ($700) and spent another $1200 in the last week. She's burning almost 20% of my take home pay in gas and is hundreds of dollars out of pocket for doctors even though we have good insurance.

My hope (perhaps foolishly) is that we can get her back on medication and work things out because things are great when she is. I've told her repeatedly I am willing to work on things and asked if she wants a divorce and she always ends the conversation without answering. I've talked to social workers both in CT and in MA and they told me they can't force her to get help. The police called asked me if I wanted to press charges against her and I said no but they told me they would still have to give the info to the DA. I don't know how I can get her charged with assault but not put in a hospital.

Neither her inlaws or I see a way to get help and she is just puttering along. We will try and talk to her about the finances but she avoids talking to anyone most of the time. If I can't get her help I think I need to protect myself financially. But I can't imagine her being able to hash out finances in a coherent way. This is complicated by my mother's death last year leaving me with a very large inheritance. I don't know where things stand now or if everything has cleared probate and I've only gotten access to 30k in a checking account and 20k in stocks but there is much more I don't have access to. I don't know what happens to with that. I don't want to screw her over but I don't know how she would handle a lot of assets and I don't want her to loose the health insurance through my job.

534,Neighbor strongarming me into building a wall/fence....,119lt9h,"Location: Hawaii

Background:

Rock wall in between the property sits on the neighbor's land. It retains 1-1.5 feet of soil from coming into my yard for about half of its length. They built it over 30 years ago and it's beginning to tilt about 15 degrees toward my line. It's completely functional, but the neighbors have been talking about replacing it for a while now (over a year). They also want to put up a rock wall in their front yard which they have been vocal about since I put one up as well.

I offered a year ago to do 50/50 and put it on the line, but they refused since it was their wall. Okay fine. It's a year later and I am off island with plans to rent my house. They now tell me that they are just going to tear it down and not replace it. I offer again to do 50/50 and they refuse.

Problem:

They counter with that it's my responsibility to put something there if they tear it down.  Their yard will obviously erode into mine and they claim the downhill neighbor has liability for erosion. Is this true?

I suspect they want me to fund the wall so they can reuse their sideyard rock for their big front wall. Rock walls have become extremely expensive and I think they got a quote and were shell-shocked.

Questions:

Is the downhill liability true?

So I guess I'm wondering if passing people taking a left on the right shoulder is legal... I remember it being legal, but I could easily be wrong. I am not asking for legal advice, just if someone knows if I actually broke a law and if I should fight it.",Elegant_Ad_8896,26,0,0.23

So far, there are two companies that are willing to sit down and listen to my pitch.

543,Advice for requesting 'Bad Faith' damages (Los Angeles Small Claims),119l6wc,"There's a lot of information here, I tried to be succinct. Thanks for any advice you can provide!

TL;DR - if you have any experience asking a judge for bad faith damages in CA, how did you go about asking the judge? I found it hard to get a word in during the small claims hearing.

I'm based in Los Angeles, CA, and suing my landlord for the return of my security deposit. I already had one Small Claims hearing where I was awarded my full deposit + court fees as judgment. My landlord appealed this decision and there will be a Trial De Novo case at a superior court, I've confirmed with the superior court that it is still a small claims case.

I'm trying to understand the 'Bad Faith' claim described in Civil Code section 1950.5 so that I can request damages from the judge.

>[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes\_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1950.5](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1950.5)  
>  
>(l) The **bad** **faith** claim or retention by a landlord or the landlord’s successors in interest of the security or any portion thereof in violation of this section, or the **bad** **faith** demand of replacement security in violation of subdivision (j), may subject the landlord or the landlord’s successors in interest to statutory damages of up to twice the amount of the security, in addition to actual damages. The court may award damages for **bad** **faith** whenever the facts warrant that award, egardless of whether the injured party has specifically requested relief. In an action under this section, the landlord or the landlord’s successors in interest shall have the burden of proof as to the reasonableness of the amounts claimed or the authority pursuant to this section to demand additional security deposits.

It's been almost 3 years since my landlord was supposed to return my deposit, I believe he violated the rules outlined in the civil code and completely fabricated evidence to support his argument.

1. He did not conduct a walk-through of the property before I moved out even though I requested this and I have that request in writing. **1950.5 (f) (1)**
2. He did not return any portion of my deposit or provide an itemized list of damages within 21 days after I moved out. **1950.5 (g) (1).** I contacted him several times over a 2-year period with emails and demand letters before finally taking this to court. My landlord later claimed during the trial that he sent the itemized list of damages but they were lost in the mail.
3. Only *after* the case was filed against him, he produced a bogus list of damages totaling $10,000 (my deposit was $4,500) as evidence for his defense. This list was just a written description of the work and an amount, with no receipts, invoices, or other documents to support the work was actually done.
4. He claims that a homeless person broke in and caused the damages and that it's our fault because we did not return the keys properly. Nowhere in the lease does it specify a 'proper' way to return keys, and we were not given any instructions. When we received the keys they were inside one of the kitchen drawers, we entered by getting a spare key from a lockbox, which he completely denies ever existed. When we locked up the property on the last day of our lease, we left the keys in the kitchen drawer where we found them.
5. His evidence also included grainy black and white photographs of damages clearly from a similar, but different apartment! It's easy to see that appliances and fixtures are in different places.

The entire hearing was over in about two minutes. The judge asked my landlord why he didn't provide a walk-through or provide anything within 21 days, my landlord replied with an incomplete answer and the judge said she heard enough.

Because he violated the 21-day return rule and failed to provide a walk-through is that enough to warrant bad faith damages?

How would I go about formally making this request to the judge? From my single experience at small claims court, the judge did all of the talking, we only got to answer questions, and she was getting upset when people were talking over her so it was truly difficult to get a word in.

I think my two hurdles are proving that his evidence is total BS, and proving that he failed to follow Civil Code 1950.5. I'd like to say to the judge ' because my landlord violated these rules and illegally withheld our deposit in bad faith, I would like to request damages'

any thoughts or advice on this would be greatly appreciated, and thanks for taking the time to read this.",BilliamLA,1,0,0.5

The car ran a red let took a left and hit her on a crosswalk breaking her electrical scooter in half, giving her a small subdural hematoma, and most importantly to me affecting her mentally because anxiety/agoraphobia runs in her family she stayed in for a long time preventing her from work and school.

548,Anthem asking me to pay back a check meant to cover Covid test,119krxw,"I took a covid test in Dec 2020 at a drive thru covid testing site in North Carolina. 

A month or two later, I received a bill from the testing site asking for around $380 to pay for the test. I called my health insurer at the time, Anthem Blue Cross, and asked what to do because covid tests are supposed to be covered.

The woman I spoke to told me to pay the provider, and that they would send me a check to reimburse me. So, I went ahead and paid the provider, and later received a check for $344 from Anthem. 

Then, last year in Oct 2022, Anthem contacted me and said they overpaid and needed the $344 back. 

I contacted Anthem in October to dispute the claim, but they apparently screwed up, never processed my complaint, and I got another bill for twice the original amount (\~$700) in late December. So I called AGAIN, disputed the claim, and they assured me they'd put in a real dispute this time and stay in contact with me.

Tonight, I received a letter from a debt collector for the original $344 and I'm pretty pissed. The covid test should have been covered by insurance. I was told it was covered. Last I heard from Anthem, I was told they were looking into the issue still. Now, I suddenly get this letter from the debt collector. I already emailed the debt collector disputing *that* claim.

What can I even do at this point? I shouldn't owe this money, but I have no idea what options are available to me or what I can do to get this canceled, especially since no one at Anthem is capable of helping me.",aGhostInTheCellar,0,0,0.33

\-We bought a range from a prominent online distributor, Appliances Connection

\-The range cost $9000, and they are offering us $6000 in refund for the following issues.

\-The range was in a sealed crate

\-We paid for interior delivery, professional installation, and range removal.  None of this happened.

\-They left the range on the porch and we never heard from them again.

\-We assumed a professional installer would arrive at some point to install the range. But no one ever came after delivery

\-After a few weeks we opened the range (which it states is to be done by the professional installer and that the installer is responsible for for checking the functioning of the range with us present.  Here is the exact verbiage from their terms:

Installer installs new appliance according to the manufacturer's specifications and to customer's satisfaction.

Installer monitors gas service and ensures there are no leaks.

Installer checks and verifies that all user functions are operational.  When performing this check, Installer walks through a demo with the customer to show the customer basic operations of their new appliance.

\-None of the above occurred at all.

\-Now they are saying since we ""waited"" so long (over 30 days) to call them to let them know they had not performed the services that we paid for that they are not responsible for the remaining damages.

It sort of WAS junk mail; it was a letter from a local attorney, the kind that is mass-mailed to people that incur a criminal charge against them. But I had no knowledge of any such thing. I certainly had not had any encounter with police or anything.

I looked up my name in the local court records website, and there it was. A charge for shoplifting, with a date in December, but for some reason it was not filed until February. 
I wanted to get more details about this mysterious charge; so I filed a public record request to get the police report. 
I finally got it, and I'm more confused than ever and I don't know what to do from here. 

The police report, apparently filed by someone who works at a Walmart, says that they saw me take a bar of Irish spring soap, put it in my purse, and leave the store without paying. 
It says they ""recognized"" me and that's how they knew my name. 
I don't know he person who filed the report, I never took a damned bar a soap, and I never received anything about this at all, aside from the letter from the lawyer. The address it said I lived at in the police report is a nonexistent address, so I am assuming that's why I never got anything. 
There is a court hearing scheduled in March about this. 
I am assuming I should go, even though I never received any documents directly, and I know they won't be able to prove they served me with me anything. But I would hate the possibility of a warrant to be issued for a damned bar of soap I didn't steal, if I didn't go.

573,Excess damages from at fault accident,119jrft,"I got a call today from somebody representing an insurance company asking for excess damage payment in the amount of 17 k. I had my insurance look into it and it seems to be legit but I do not have that kind of money. From my understanding, I have three options.

1. Get a loan to attempt to cover the amount requested.

2. Hagle with the individual and the tempt to settle for a reduced price. (I could possibly get 5-7 k)

3. Call their Bluff because I cannot pay it and see if the insurance company will just eat the loss. 

I was told that the insurance company retains the right to sue me for the amount. My insurance company stated that if they do sue me they will have one of their lawyers represent me. It is my understanding that the worst case scenario is that I get sued and will eventually have to pay the full amount a couple months down the road.

576,Restaurant makes servers to pay cash for tipout but puts their tip on their paycheck [Fl],119jnv0,"Hello !
My friend started to work in this new restaurant in NW Florida as a server. 
He makes most of his tips on credit card, but at the end of the shift he has to tip out 4% of his sales to the bussers in cash, even if he didn’t make any cash tip. Paycheck is biweekly, so he is required to carry several hundreds of dollars to pay out. 
But the full amount of tip goes to his paycheck, and they withhold Social Security and taxes on all of his income. The bussers are getting cash, so pretty much the servers have to pay thier taxes too. 
Is it even legal ? What can he do about it. 
There’s also more weird things at this restaurant. They put a 3.5% cash discount on the customer’s checks, which means they make the customers pay for the credit card fees. But they taking 5% of the servers’ tip as credit card fee. I know they are allowed to do that, but it seems they make money on the servers. 
The servers also have to tip out the kitchen on the to go orders. It can be more than a hundred dollars during the busy season. But the owner doesn’t give the money to the cooks, he buys them lunch and enery drinks and stuff like that.

578,Accused of stealing on a delivery,119jjgn,"On February 19th, I completed a DoorDash order at a store for a small order. To ensure the accuracy of the delivery, I had my friend show the to-go lady the picture of the order, and she handed it to him for delivery. Approximately one hour later, I received a call from DoorDash, instructing me to return the order that I had allegedly stolen from the store. I informed DoorDash that I only had one order, and it had already been delivered to the customer.

Despite my explanation, I went back to the store to clear the air and prove my innocence. However, upon my arrival, the manager accused me of stealing the order and threatened to involve the police. I reiterated that I only had one order and that my friend had retrieved it from the to-go lady. The manager alleged that we had taken two bags, including a large catering order, but I confirmed that we only had the order that we had come for.

I asked the manager to review the store's footage or send it to DoorDash, but he refused. He threatened to call the police and subsequently blocked me from the store. I returned to the store a day later, and the manager agreed to review the footage since he had not yet done so. On a subsequent visit, the manager was unwilling to cooperate and expressed frustration with the situation. He denied me access to his store and stated that he would continue to block me from picking up orders.

Following these events, I informed DoorDash, who launched an investigation to obtain proof of the incident. I was advised that the investigation would take between two and five days to complete. Despite my friend's testimonies and my own, the store manager continues to believe that I stole the order.

Given the gravity of the situation, I am seeking guidance on how best to proceed beyond allowing DoorDash to handle the matter.

“I would like to submit a claim with the following information-
Our next payment is due between February first-fifteenth, if this issue could be resolved by then that would be much appreciated.
 
Attached is the county tax information for our property, Indiana, Loan Number #.  I am submitting this information because we have a shortage amount of $200/month or $3,000 due this year (2023.) (these numbers have been rounded for posting) 
 
After research on my own, because Mortgage company, could give me no further information, we have learned that we are responsible for the previous owner's using our property as a rental (not filing for the Homestead Exemption). I spoke to Lender (who was the lender we used to start the process) he continued to say ""we use the most current information to calculate the taxes for the property.""   I have found on file xxxx comparison, dated 3.15.22 sent to the previous owner, that there is important information attached. As you can see on this file that the 2021 pay 2022 tax amount is included showing no homestead exemption was filed, this should have been factored into my taxes/mortgage while I was paying the 2022 taxes for 2021.  I do not believe we should be responsible for the shortage because the new tax information was provided before the closing date of 3.16.22, and no information about the previous owner not filing homestead exemption was provided to us before closing.”

We have a shortage from the title company using 2020 taxes to factor in for 2022, but the title company did not factor in that it was a rental for the year 2021 so there was no homestead exemption filed, so there was a shortage this year in our escrow account",amickaylie,0,1,0.67

586,Am I in any way obligated to hire an attorney/lawyer in this case?,119j40p,"Noob questions here,

So i've been having this disagreement with the deduction on my security deposit.

I was planning to file a small claim against the leasing office but ended up feeling it's not worth the time and money. The deduction is 500+ dollars for fixing the floor that they claim I damaged, whereas for me I can genuinely say there was no excessive use at all, the vinyl plank literally just peeled off at some point during my staying. They claim they're covering the material cost but had to outsource the labor and the invoice says it requires 4 HOURS for repairing that, it was literally just 2 vinyl plank(length is a few inches) corners peeled off, no holes, no scratches nothing, just plain corner peel-off.

**I told the leasing office over the phone that if they refuse to refund the deduction portion(that I disagree with) then I will be forced to take legal action on this and they can expect a letter from the attorney.** We had discussions over the phone on how that was caused but I'll omit that part, the conversation was alright, nobody was angry or anything, they just refuse to refund that money.

If it helps at all, I'm located in MA.

My questions are:

1. Is it legal at all to say what I've said, would this be considered il-legal threat?
2. Can they sue me for saying this?
3. I'm still planning to consult a lawyer in my local area for my options but most likely I'll just eat it up and move on with my life, if I do end up NOT hiring an attorney to send a letter to them, am I in some sort of trouble? I keep thinking to myself that because I said that, then I'm legally obligated to eventually hire a lawyer/attorney to file a lawsuit against them.

Now they are saying my mother owes the company back $102k.  The company owes my uncle $342k for the loans and not taking a distribution every time my mother did. We had no idea any of this was going on at the time. The repayment requested for my mother is to sell shares of the company.

593,Seller Backed out 2 days before closing,119ik4m,"My wife and I were preparing to buy what could be our dream home in Southwest Michigan.  The whole process was plagued by the fact that the seller was super slow to respond to everything, which we chaulked up to him being a long haul trucker and we gave him the benefit of the doubt on.  Our initial inspection period would have ended on November 10th.

Fast forward a few days, and on November 7th we discover that the septic is infact bad (draining into a local ditch).  His realtor cancels our appraisal without telling us, and gets to work getting quotes on septic which took time, and she had trouble getting ahold of him once she had a few quotes.  Verbally his realtor believed he would fix it but nothing in writing.  The next Tuesday November 15th he said he wouldn't fix it.  We later via text between our realtors asked if he would go half in.  The next morning he said no.  I met with our lender and figured out how we were going to pay for it, but by the time we contacted his realtor he said he changed his mind, wouldn't let our second attempt at an appraisal in, and wouldn't sell.  We were supposed to close on November 18th.

We sent him a few nasty letters from our lawyer and in mid January we wrote a formal complaint for breach of the contract and for specific performance.  His lawyer responded with a problematic piece of evidence (it was a text between him and his realtor, mislabeled as a text between our realtor and his realtor saying that we would back out if he didn't pay it).

The other piece of evidence is the one that scares me.  Our contract states that:

""The above inspections shall be ordered by the Buyer, at the Buyer's expensive.  The  Buyer must, by a written notice, either remove the inspection/permit contingencies or terminate this Agreement within 10 business days of the Effect Date of this Agreement.

In the event the buyer neither removes the contingencies nor terminates this Agreement in the time provided, the Buyer shall be deemed to have waived the contingencies and proceed to close this transaction.  **Any request by the Buyer to modify this Agreement based on the results of an inspection(s) shall terminate this Agreement by the deadline indicated on line 92, unless: 1) the request is agreed to by Seller, in writing, by said date or 2) the Buyer proceeds to remove the inspection contingency, in writing, by said date. ""**

Because we asked on the 15th of November if he would go half in on it with us his lawyer is claiming that we cancelled the agreement since we didn't in writing cancel the contingency.  I'm also not sure if it matters, but we never demanded or threatened to back out if he didn't pay.  The inspection window would have closed on the 10th.  My lawyer thinks we have a strong case, but the sellers lawyer is saying we'll have to go to court to settle it.  Losing would be most of our nest egg, so its not something that I'm considering lightly.

During the closing, we did not opt for a title owner's policy offered by the title company. We found out the original owner took out a second mortgage on the house. That owner then died and the executor of the estate sold the house to the flipper under a fiduciary deed. Flipper then sells the house to us with a general warranty deed. Nothing came from the search that the title company conducted. 

Fast forward to today, we are being sued by the bank that issued the second mortgage for the remainder of the loan (+interest) that the original owner took out. The title company we used is claiming the lien was not indexed correctly with the county, thus they did not find it in their search. We tried to have our mortgage company file a claim with their insurance - they denied our request.

This business is a website that generates income via affiliate sales (commissions). I would like to setup an LLC for the website in Kentucky as the filing fee is only $40. I would use a registered agent for the business address and ti receive/forward documents. However, I live exclusively in Texas. 

I am the only owner and the only manager. All commissions go directly to me to help keep the website running and I keep the profit. At the end of the year, who do I pay taxes too?

606,Basement flooding after first home purchase,119hfui,"Hi all, we purchased our first home just over a month ago. We've recently gotten our first big rain, and our entire basement is leaking from just about every corner. In the disclosure there was noted to be a minor leak at the front of the home. All three rooms in the basement have substantial water, and the floor is already discolored. There was a floor drain, and we put items on pallets in anticipation of said leak to see the exact nature in the room. This has essentially made the basement unusable without the addition of a dewatering system or a sump pump. Our realtor has yet to help besides offering solutions to the issue after the fact and has not responded since I asked if there were any avenues for recourse. Friends have suggested I talk to a property lawyer, but we are already spread thin from the purchase itself and other issues that have come up. Im curious if this could lead to anything, or I'd be wasting my time. I'm having trouble finding information on this by other avenues.

We have previously had maintenance requests that were ignored, such as my upstairs neighbors toilet leaking into our unit which took 3.5 months to be completed. Back in September 2022, I was doing laundry in the basement under our unit and a ton of water was leaking through one of the corner walls. I immediately called the emergency maintenance line and reported the leak. After not hearing anything, I returned from a vacation and input a maintenance request via our tenant app September 27,2022 including photos and a detailed description of what’s going on. The leak is not as bad as it was the first day, as it’s not the result of a pipe, but missing bricks in the foundation allowing the elements to come in at any opportunity. The leasing company without permission must’ve entered my unit, because they said they had evaluated and saw it was not a leak but a waterproofing issue. I was told they’d be sending a quote 10/5/22 for services. The contractor pushed it back. After several follow ups via call and tenant app, I was told as it’s now winter waterproofing is no longer an option until May. I complained of the mold from the sitting water, and they said they would contact a mold agency but it would come back. Again I’ve been ignored, no mold agency has contacted at all. I stated that if i need to seek repairs on my own I will, but you must let me know either way. No response again. Am I eligible to terminate my lease, or withhold rent?

He came back and he said it was towed because my car was destroyed, now the hood is cracked but not totaled and they said it would cost $156 to get it out but it will go up because of storage fees.

I am responsible for the vehicles on the property as well. One of my hired drivers was in a very minor accident while returning the a member of the company to the airport in the company owned transport van that I am responsible for. Naturally I told him to grab the insurance card and give the other driver the information. When he got the vehicle back to the property we immediately called the insurance company and filed the claim and reported all necessary information. Then I wrote an email to the CEO and the account of the company and informed them of what had happened (as we do before and/or after any financial things happen.)

Feb 26 is a Sunday, so either I really have to vacate on Sat Feb 25 or Mon Feb 27 which is past my supposed vacate date.

My big issue is that before I have even vacated they put a yellow slip in my mailbox saying ""ATTENTION MAIL CARRIER. THIS ADDRESS IS CURRENTLY VACANT. DO NOT PLACE MAIL IN THIS BOX. VACANT!"" Except it's not vacant, right? I paid the full month, I should get the full month.

I went to the leasing office and the lady there said my mail likely was returned to the post office, and if they don't hold it will be returned to sender. Fortunately for me I had set up a forwarding address last week, so maybe my mail was sent there. I haven't been to the new address yet, but when I checked my mailbox at my apt was no mail in there, just this yellow slip.

My big concern is that I may have been popped by a red light camera. If they sent the fine to this apartment address, there's a chance it was returned.

I don't check my mail every day. I don't even check it every week as I usually don't get that much mail aside from junk like credit card offers and Every Plate promos.

Is the apartment at fault for not giving me the full month of February, even though I paid the whole month of February, and are they wrong to pre-emptively return my mail to sender before I actually vacated the apartment?

625,[Massachusetts] Do I have a case for wrongful termination?,119g52b,"
Hi,

  So my boss fired me last week when I was sick and provided a Drs. Note. There was also never any warning. She emailed my termination letter and it was full of mistakes. The start date was listed as 2 weeks after I had already started. She also claimed I had 20 absences. 
I went through all my paystubs and counted 8 and I have Drs notes for them. 

This week I filed for unemployment and my boss just emailed me saying she can’t fill out the unemployment questionnaire until I respond to the termination letter. My question is do I need to respond? I didn’t think I needed to considering I was fired.

* You may not bring an action to contest the trust more than 120 days from the date this notification by the trustee is served upon you or 60 days from the date on which a copy of the terms of the trust is mailed or personally delivered to you during that 120 day period, whichever is later

I have 2 mortgages, a normal ""senior"" mortgage which I took out when I bought my house 10 years ago, and a junior ""heloc"" loan, which I took in 2017. 

Both offered covid forebearances in april of 2020.   Both ended them around October 2021 (I believe).  The senior mortgage basically went back to earlier payments.  The junior mortgage asked for all the money at once.   The junior mortgage is with US bank.   I asked for the accumulated amount to be moved to the end of the heloc (probably mortgage modification) ,but after going back and forth with a lot of different paperwork something didn't click.  Meanwhile their collectors called me constantly asking for money.  I asked what my monthly payment now was, which they said they didn't know.   I said, I can't pay what I don't know.   And they kept asking for the entire forebearance amount . 

This went on till about 2 months ago - the filed a foreclosure.    During the post-forebearance period,  I did occasionally pay the old monthly payment, but I guess not frequently enough.  I  don't want to lose my house. I don't want to go into bankruptcy.  I was thinking about countering them for the redemption amount citing that they failed  to render substantial performance by not determining a monthly amount post forebearance .

The forebearance amount accrued amount is about 15K, which I can probably pay off.  The redemption is 40k, which I cannot.

635,Threatened with legal action over a Zelle transaction,119foqx,"Sorry in advance as this will probably be long winded but i’d like some advice.

So, on Dec 21st I received a Zelle payment of $1,100 to my bank from a name and number I did not recognize. Immediately after, I’m getting bombarded by calls from said number and when I don’t answer, he starts texting me.  He states “Please call me I sent you a Zelle transfer by mistake. Thank you” then sends a follow up message stating my full name, which gave me the heebie jeebies.

I, not wanting to be a terrible person, tell him i’m sorry this happened but as the Zelle scams have recently run rampant I explain that he’ll have to file a claim through his bank/Zelle to reverse the original transaction as I have to keep myself safe from any type of fraud or scams. He begins begging me to send the money back and I tell him that I won’t be touching his money at all and that I’ll help in any way I can but this needs to be handled formally by his bank.

He doesn’t accept this and accuses me of stealing his money. I try and help out by calling my bank to see if there’s anything I can do on my end on the off chance this isn’t a scammer but like an older man who doesn’t understand technology. The bank confirms I should not be sending any money back as it would put my account at risk because if this is a scam and I send the money back it would be considered a new “at will” transaction. So, if he decides to file a claim and reverse the original then I’ll be out the money that was sent over. The only safe course of action as explained to me is for him to file a claim to reverse the original. I tell him this, he gets upset but says he will try and make that happen. I wish him luck.

Weeks later he begins sending me “paperwork” of his bank claiming they’ve opened a claim but have had no response from my bank. I bank with a MASSIVE bank so it’s not like this is a little credit union which could be hard to connect with. He says his bank has received no contact from mine and the only way to get his money back is if I send it back of my own volition. The paperwork he has sent over is a “bank letter”, and a screenshot of a zelle customer service chat. He also sends me his “banker’s” direct number for me to call her myself. I’m not convinced, but to not be cruel I tell him I will go in person into a branch to review the documents with a banker.

I go to the bank with my close friend who is a paralegal and current law student as a witness. The bank opens my account and confirms i have no active claims or any authorizations pending per this issue. They tell me this scam is pretty common and that even if it is true I should absolutely not be sending the money back as a new transaction. The best way forward is once again a reversal on the original. I have the bank agent document that advice and record my visit in my file.

Mind you, throughout this time he is still blowing up my phone asking me when I’m going to “resolve” this issue for him. It is now February and I’ve had enough so I tell him what the agent told me and reiterate again that it falls on him to properly file his claims and that I will no longer be involving myself as I cannot do anything on my end.

This is where he begins to threaten me. He tells me I’m not cooperating and that I should have more than enough proof by now to believe this isn’t a scam. He says he knows where I live and where my family lives and lists mine and their address. He says he knows all my information so it’s best I cooperate. I tell him that I have gone above and beyond for him, a stranger, and that i will no longer be tolerating his disrespect especially as he has now threatened me. He says he will be pursuing legal action as this would count as a felony “theft” as the amount is over $300. I tell him to go ahead and do what he needs to do.

I have spoken to several people, including the police and have been assured that I haven’t done anything wrong or illegal. I did not ask/force/extort him to send me that money and the bank considers it an “at will” transaction. I even tried to find a way to safely send the money back for him and have stated I have no desire to keep it. I have documentation that the bank has advised me not to act as it would put my account at risk.

Today, he sent me a series of photos claiming he was at his local police department. Keep in mind, he claims to live in my hometown about 20min where my family lives which is why that was concerning. So the local department pictured is also in an area I recognize, but I suppose anyone could take that photo if they know my address. He sends me a picture of a police report with a case number but did not include the portion showing any cause of action. Then he sent the photos he took as “proof” of my stealing which was just printouts of our texts, but in those photos he sent one showing my contact information in his phone which shows my complete address, my parents address, and my age.

I filed a police report against him when the threats came in but what should I do now? Is this considered harassment at this point? Is there any validity to his claims? I’m curious to know that I am covered in this situation as many people have told me, but he keeps insisting I’m in the wrong so I’d just like to assuage any doubts especially if he does try and take me to court.

HR brought in the senior operations managers to have a serious conversation about offending that employee, when my wife didn’t even say the offending statements.

639,How to do discovery after winning small claims court in SC?,119fgij,"I won several judgments against someone in small claims court in SC totaling \~40k.

After winning, I had to file for a ""Transcript of Judgement"". When I called the county clerk, she made it seem like my only options are to file the judgment with the clerk and have the Sheriff try to find anything of value that can be actioned, or I'd have to go through the process of hiring a lawyer if I wanted to see their bank accounts. 

**How can I do discovery by myself? Or is it highly recommended that I don't try that?**

Since the judgments I have against this person are around 40k, I doubt the sheriff will find anything that can be auctioned off that would put a dent in this amount. 

The defendant is a residential contractor/home rehabber so I know they have personal and business accounts with a decent amount of money that they use to buy supplies and run their operations. 

They've completely ignored all the court filings so far which is why I won every judgment by default, and I'd like to find a way to access their bank accounts before they have time to hide or transfer funds. If I go the auction route first, they'll know I'm serious about collecting and might change their banking situation.

640,My ex husband’s name is on the property deed,119ffwy,"I have been officially divorced from my ex-husband for nearly 10 years. Prior to that divorce, my parents transferred the title of a property they owned to me as an inheritance. I went to the county office with my mom to have everything transferred in my name, and our signatures were the only names on the deed. When I got divorced, my ex husband agreed that we wouldn’t split the value of that property, as it was gifted to me by my parents in an effort to keep the property in my family, and we both wanted my nieces and nephews as well as our sons to be able to enjoy the property for many more years. I have been maintaining the property and covering all expenses related to it ever since. The county where the property is located recently contacted me and asked me to update my information, as my old surname is still on the deed. I was shocked to find that my ex husband’s name is on the deed, as well. Like I said, he did not come with me when it was signed over to me, but I am assuming that someone in the county reached out to him for his signature as we were married at the time. I immediately pulled out my divorce decree and discovered that nothing about this property is even mentioned in the document. I know that I made the request to the lawyer to add this information in the decree, but, at the time, I was grieving the loss of two family members and recovering from a brain injury. Somehow it slipped my mind, and I am feeling stupid and don’t know how to proceed. According to the deed, my ex husband owns half of the property. Our split was not amicable, and I need to resolve this issue immediately. I’ve contacted a lawyer, and I am hoping for good news. Is there any chance that because it’s not mentioned in the divorce decree, he no longer has rights to it? Do I have to get him to sign it over to me? How should I proceed?

641,Tree contractor damaged neighbors property but neighbor only wants a lot of money,119ffdk,"Hi,

We hired a licensed and bonded tree service with great reviews to remove some really tall trees 100 ft on a shared hillside with large slope with a neighbor in CA.

The neighbor in question is a next door neighbor next to our house with whom we share a fence that ends at the foot of the hill and then there is no fence going up the hill. The trees being cut are on our side of the fence if you drew an imaginary property line up the hill using the fence and we paid for all the service.

My neighbors have some old wooden structures that are 30 years old and well past their useful life. The main structures are some low retaining walls, 2” x 8” etc that were in direct contact with the hill and some planter type structures that were extremely close to the trees and, in fact, under them in some instances.

Our hillside has zero structures.

The tree service completed their work to our satisfaction but our neighbor is claiming that the tree service damaged their hillside to the extent of $3-5 thousand dollars worth of damage. There is some evidence of some of the old boards having fallen apart (all rotted out) most likely due to the cutting of trees and workers needing to access the area to bring material down (I was not there during the work). It is hard to tell because any before photos show the hillside completely overgrown and it’s hard to assess what was actually there.

The contractor was willing to put things back together for the neighbor but the neighbor refuses his offer and only wants monetary compensation. 

I am concerned my neighbor is taking advantage of the situation as I disagree with the $ amount of repairing the damage. This would not result in the neighbor being made whole but much better than before the situation.

I have a few questions in addition to any general thoughts:
-What is the extent of my liability here?
-What should be the next steps as the homeowner if neighbor only wants compensation at this point?

642,Should we contact insurance over this car accident?,119ffdh,"Me and my husband were driving in the mountains in Colorado today. It was very snowy and the wind picked up and everything turned white. We couldn’t see anything. We saw headlights and both our car and the other car swerved and just barely side swept each other. Now I don’t really know what comes next or who is at fault. We exchanged insurance info but since it was so white and couldn’t see, we don’t know who was in whose lane. We didn’t slide or move the wheel but there are curves on the road. Neither car had much damage. Small dents on ours and a scratch on our car and my husband said his (the other drivers) was a little worse but more or less the same. He got out and talked to the guy. It was probably 500 or less in damages. If it were just us I wouldn’t even talk to insurance but since this is a stranger I don’t know how they will handle it.  Do I contact insurance anyway? Should I wait until I hear anything about the other driver contacting our insurance? My husband and I are both young and haven’t dealt with a situation like this before. 

We both exchanged insurance. He gave us his and we gave him ours.

I hope you are doing well.

I'm having a problem with a law firm in Europe. (important so you know that I'm not talking about the U.S.)

Basically what happened is this: a bunch of people forged the documents of my apartment and sold it.

I'm trying to get it back and I contacted a lawyer to help me with that. (the house is in a different country from where I live)

**This is the problem:** we reached a point where my lawyer needed to go to the notary that was present during the selling of the house to acquire the legal documents to understand what happened.

The problem? It's 6 months that I'm waiting.

I asked what is going on and he said that the notary who was present during the selling of my house died 1-2 years ago and that all the documents are now in the hands of another notary.

He told me that this notary is old and really difficult to work with.

Now, it's 6 months since we are waiting for a bunch of basic documents – and my lawyer keeps saying that he will update me when he has something.

Is this possible or is he bullshitting me?

I can understand that some notaries can be really difficult to work with.

But 6 months? Half a year? For a bunch of basic documents?

Maybe this is common and I just have to deal with this. But I'm questioning what he is really doing.

I'm also a bit more anxious because I lost an apartment, so not a great feeling to wait half a year for this.

646,How do I go about reporting abuse from a teacher?,119f8ra,"For context, I'm a relatively recent high school graduate, I started college recently.

I was abused by multiple teachers in the school system I attended my whole life, and I still live close (the university I chose to go to is about 15 minutes away from my parent's house). I have severe mental health issues because of it, as well as physical illnesses that were likely caused by the traumatic experiences. I didn't report it at the time because I didn't think anyone would believe me. The teacher I want to report the most was and is highly renowned and just the year before she taught me, she won an award from the county for being the ""Best Teacher."" Recently, I was talking to my aunt about what happened to me and she thinks that I should report it because those teachers shouldn't be around children and they could have done it to others. Admittedly, I do feel very guilty about not reporting. I worry they did this to others. However, I have no idea how to do this or what the implications are.

I don't have any concrete evidence, because this was all between 5 and 13 years ago. Regardless, I didn't really have any evidence in the first place. I didn't record anything and everything happened in person, no digital or paper records. All I'd have is testimony from me and a few others, and maybe testimony from a few of my medical providers. Because of this, I'm unsure if they'd even consider my report. 

Additionally, I'm unsure who to talk to. In an ideal world, these people would be brought to some sort of legal justice, but I highly doubt that would happen because of the lack of evidence. So, I assume I'd have to talk to someone in the school system, but I don't know who that'd be.

648,Hazardous mechanical failures after simple mechanic work,119f3cn,"I recently purchased a 2001 Astro AWD Van that I knew needed new brakes, it was part of the negotiation. I was driving past a shop in Portland, Oregon that I had seen a nice looking astro at so I figured it would be a good place to work on my van. 

I stopped by and they had an opening on the next day to work on the brakes so I left the van there. It had a squeaky belt and unkown last oil change so I also had them change the belt/tensioner, oil and check all fluids. 

Next day I get a call saying that it needs all new brake hardware in the front and that the rear brake lines are rusted out and they will have to bend new ones. Also, my idler arms are worn and should be replaced.

I tell them to go ahead with the brake lines and idler arms. I go pick up the van and the bill was just under 2k. Pretty steep but whatever, it was a decent amount of work.

9 days later I'm driving and my brake pedal suddenly goes straight to the floor, no brake pressure. I have maybe 5% braking power with the pedal on tbe floor. I was close to home and driving slowly, thankfully, so I limp it home and notice that the inside of the front right wheel is coated in brake fluid.

I live close to the shop so next morning i drive there extremely slowly with my receipt in hand and demand they have a look. Turns out one of the brake line banjo bolts was loose and leaking a lot of fluid/pressure. They replace the washer, tighten the bolt and send me on my way. I'm annoyed but whatever, sh*t happens and at least they quickly took care of it. I drive on steep mountain highways a lot and was thankful the brake failure didn't happen then as it could have easily caused a deadly wreck.

10 Days later (yesterday), driving home all of a sudden my steering is suddely almost completely disconnected (steering wheel turns easily but wheels barely turn). Again, thankfully I was close to home and driving slowly. I pull over best I can, open the door and try turning the wheel while listening. There is a loud clunk coming from the front axle. I turn off the van, look under the front and see a nut sitting on the ground by the front right wheel. I look up and see that the idler arm is completely disconnected as the nut that holds it to a frame bracket fell off. 

It's late at night and I am very close to home so I call up my roommate and ask him to bring an adjustable wrench so i can try getting the nut back on. It's difficult but I get the idler arm attached well enough to feel comfortable limping it home at very low speed and avoiding turning as much as I can. I look at the other idler arm and the nut is already visibly working itself loose.


Next day (today) I tighten it a bit more and limp it to the shop. This time I am quite irritated because it's the second mechanical failure that could have easily cost me my life or someone else's clearly caused by neglect to properly tighten hardware. They act dumbfounded and tighten everything up with loctite and send me on my way. 

This time I ask for a written record that they had to tighten the idler arms and I am pissed that I didn't do the same for the brake failure.

I am upset because a day before the idler arm disconnected I was going down steep windy mountain roads and if that had happened then I would have easily flown off the edge of a cliff to my certain death. Not to mention that I could have caused someone else the same fate and this is the second time in 3 weeks I have been in this risk. All of this because of neglect to tighten critical hardware in a very simple job.

Could/Should I try to get something out of this? I feel I am at the very least owed a partial/full refund for the improper and hazardous work that was done.

They are trying to sell it for $1,288! 

I read many complaints against this company, scamming several people. They claim to not be practicing any cybersquatting or anything, but this seems extremely sketchy - that just as I register, they purchase the domain I would naturally want to buy. 

There is actually a form on Dynadot's website where you can report domain abuse. Perhaps what they are doing is technically legal until I own the trademark? The domain expires on January 16th of next year. I don't mind waiting, but I have a feeling they will just get it again. I mean, all the other domains I've seen on GoDaddy cost $20ish per year. So this definitely feels like a scam, to have to pay over $1200 more. (Plus many people have complained that after they paid, something went wrong and was never fixed so I am extremely hesitant to do any business with Dynadot.)

Can I legally do anything about this or not until the trademark registration is complete? From my understanding, if everything goes right in registering, I won't actually own the trademark until 12-18 months after I applied.

My main concern though, is this: Could this affect my trademark registration?

Seeking help from the community here as I have not found any results on this matter on Google. So my gf bought an online course 3 years back. The course consists of course material, online classes and a certificate at the end. They were advertising to be completely free when to learn and doing the exams. So there was bo set time limit for the certificate to complete. 

A lot of horrible things happened to my gf the last couple of years, so doing the course was just not a priority and still is not as there is much else going on. We always has the course in mind, but knew that there is no hurry to complete.

But a couple of month back they suddenly set a deadline to complete the certificate. Basically because the company wants to set up a new course. One could upgrade to the newer version of the course (but only for extra costs).

So my question: Is this even legally allowed? My gf did not even start the course yet, so can we demand them to not set a deadline, upgrade for free if they cannot do so or demand the money back if neither of that works for them? The company is based in the US.

663,Can I withhold rent if my landlord refuses to repair a leaky roof/ceiling? [WI],119eeaq,"It's been a few months now since a deluge found its way into a weak point in the ceiling, and every time it rains, we get a steady light stream of water through one small hole. Landlord claimed he fixed it, but he's not a professional anything and his efforts were futile. He knows it's still leaky and has done nothing.

Granted, I haven't harassed him about it the past few months since it's been cold enough to prevent any leakages, but we've needed to address this for obvious mold and safety issues.

And while I'm at it, can I ask how bad windows need to be to demand repairs? They're ancient and drafty; some of the wood is actually rotting to the point where you could almost stick your finger all the way through. Landlord claimed he ""was going to replace the windows,"" but instead returned with a caulking gun (seriously) and just caulked the rotten holes. Anyone determined to break in could easy just break through them.

As a result, one of the rooms in the house never exceeds 61 degrees, and we've been paying out the ass just to heat the place.

Would any of this allow me the right to withhold rent until repairs are made?

Can I also demand he hire a professional? He's a ""handyman"" so assumes he knows how to do everything and I want to ensure it's done correctly.

Is it also legal for him to threaten to raise the rent on grounds of repairs? When I confronted him about the windows, he told me he could charge more for the place. 

What about a mold inspection? Would I be responsible for those costs? Any guidance is appreciated!",Swedishmeatballs6890,0,0,0.5
664,Question about sealing a conviction in Illinois and Education waivers.,119ed9h,"This question is pertains to Illinois.

I am nearing the end of a 2 year probation sentence for a felony conviction (in a few months). Afterwards I am hoping to seal the conviction. Illinois has a 3 year waiting period for sealing after the completion of a sentence, meaning I could not even try to seal this until 2026.

However, there is a special exception that can be made if the defendant was awarded some sort of educational or vocational certificate during the serving of his sentence. In such cases the waiting period to seal may be waived, and can instead be done as soon as the sentence has ended. 

In my situation am pursuing a Bachelors of Science from an accredited university. I started this during the probation period, near the beginning. However due to the length of my probation and the length of time required for the degree, the probation will end BEFORE the competition of the degree. The degree will be completed in approximately one year following.

I've known him for over ten years, so I didn't see any issues with this. He needed a vehicle of his own because his father would constantly take the one he loaned him when he was upset with him. Bare in mind, the friend is in his thirties, he just can't afford to live on his own after separating from his fiance. Because of everything listed above, I decided to help him get a vehicle because I had the capability where he didn't. We get him a motorcycle because he was insistent on that over a car. I'm the primary for the loan and insurance on the bike, with him as secondary. The loan is also set to come out of my bank account, but we had an agreement on when he would bring certain amounts of money to cover payments. Everything was peachy for the first few months, then he would disappear for a week or two before appearing and giving the money. A couple of months ago he disappeared and no one has heard from him since. I went to see his father, apparently, he sporadically left and he doesn't know where he went only that he was going downhill fast. Now I'm stuck with a payment that's about to go up which I can't afford to shoulder alone, and a possible address he could be living at. I have been advised to speak to a magistrate to put out a call (I can't remember the specific wording) for the bike to get it back.

Last night me and my friends went to go see the new Antman movie. We bought our tickets at the box office, where there was a warning about flashing lights for a different movie, but not Ant-Man. One of my friends is epileptic, so since the movie was not on the warning sign, assumed he was safe. He ended up having a minor seizure during a sequence with a lot of flashing light, and had to leave the theatre to center himself and get water. There was absolutely no warning about this, so I called the theatre today to ask if they were issuing the warning. They said no and they would “work on it” then quickly hung up. My question is, did they violate the law by not doing this in the first place? Is it a violation of the ADA? My friend doesn’t want to take any legal action, but I think there should be better warnings in place. I did ask my friend who works at a movie theatre in Michigan about the warnings, and she said they were required to give them for AntMan. So what  happened here and did this theatre violate the law?

Being that he raised me i tried to stay by his side as long as i could because we didn't know when exactly his time would be, we just knew it would be very very soon.

672,Someone used my identity to purchase a vehicle. Can the dealer and lender be held liable?,119e3fp,"Someone purchased a vehicle from a used car dealership in another state. We only found out because we got a letter in the mail from the lender stating when the first payment date was due. We reported this to the police and have an open case. Looks like the person who did this actually made a fake ID with all my information but used their picture from what the detective told us. 

We contacted the lender and they provided us with all the paperwork involved in purchasing this car, including the retails buyer order, purchase agreement, insurance, dealer application, etc.

I’m looking at the dealer paperwork and there are tons of inconsistencies:
- first name is spelled inconsistently in different documents
- wrong birth date on application (month and year are same but wrong day)
- employer name is spelled horribly incorrect and actually if someone did a simple google search would realize it doesn’t even exist
- mortgage amount is listed as $300 per month (lol)

I called the dealer and asked them how this could happen and what’s the point of someone doing an application if they don’t even verify anything. The guy who I talked to said they don’t verify at all.

As far as the lender goes, they waived paystub verification and proof of residence which we are really pissed about since that would have prevented this from occurring. Apparently they waived this bc my credit score was so high. 

I’m trying to understand if I have any legal basis for suing the lender or dealership for not taking appropriate measures to verify the identity. My credit score has dropped 30 points so I’m not sure if that’s “enough” damage but I’m worried now that this person has all my information. I’ve done a credit freeze and reported to FTC.

Is there anything I can do to hold the dealership or lender accountable?

Edit: also want to add that I have an 800+ credit score and the lender approved a 19% interest rate of 72 months. Wouldn’t the dealer see this as a red flag? Why would anyone with a high credit score get a 19% interest rate. I actually purchased a car in February and got a 3.5% credit rate bc of my credit score",Organic-Kale-123,4,1,0.56
673,Cash app refuses to delete my account despite it being compromised,119e0m4,"TLDR So like 6 months ago I got a few charges in my cash app account that I clearly did not make.  It started at like 4am and every day since this multiple charges have been attempted. The charges are denied so I’m not losing money but cash app refuses to delete the account.

Details.  When the first charges showed up I freaked out and contacted the “vendor” as well as cash app. When the vendor turned out to be clearly bs I was left just dealing with support from cash app. Which sucked but months later I was able to recover the amount lost which was 300 dollars. At that point I had the security lock on and turned off cash tag, deactivated the card, and unlinked my bank account.  

Every few days since the first unauthorized charges showed up, there are multiple, sometimes 5-10 attempts to charge the account from totally random vendors ranging from a few to a few hundred dollars.  The charges are declined but I’m concerned about all these charges being attempted in my name. 

Every time I speak with support they tell me in order to close the account I have to resolve the remaining balance. I tell them I don’t want the 60 cents they can keep it because I don’t want  my bank account info anywhere near their insecure system and it would take 50 years to dispute all the attempts to charge the account because support makes you select each one and it took months just resolve two of them.

To start this off, I (F17) work at a chain entertainment business, I started last year and so far it has been fine, I have a male manager who is in his mid twenties who is known for showing favoritism to his female employees who flirt with him. (most of them are minors) I have made it known since the very beginning that I have a boyfriend however I can be a bit oblivious when people are flirting with me so I personally haven't caught anything.

I have only been to the bathroom twice before this during my 7 hour shift and let coworkers know before I left. I was extremely uncomfortable with him coming inside the women's restroom and decided to make a complaint to corporate and they were pretty unhelpful and said they would send my complaint to my manager.

Am I legally obligated to inform someone of their payment mistake in a non corporate or professional environment? Would've put this in finance but you can't make a full post there. I just sold a box of my old collectibles to a hobby store, payment for which was sent to me thru a third party app and I then transferred that money to my bank account without fail or hiccup. I thanked the buyer, and left. While the person who bought my collectibles is a ""Professional"", and employed by this hobby shop, I am not. I am not a salesman nor a professional collector or reseller, I just brought my old collection in to see what it was worth. I wake up this morning to find that the dude who I sold my collectibles to has said ""hey, it looks like My check bounced, I'll have the money to you today."" confused I say ""ok"". I go and check my account and the money is still there. My questions is, am I legally obligated to inform this dude of his mistake or is it his responsibility to realize his mistake, if there even is one. idk if this third party app will inform me that the money they transferred to me actually had no right being transferred and they will request it back or what. if his check did bounce I'm not sure how the money made its way thru this third party app and into my bank account and is still there. basically is it my responsibility to inform this guy of his mistake, or should I just wait? I didnt ask him or tell him to send me more. Because, if he does indeed send over a second payment, wouldn't his bank keep track of how much money left his account and he can just check the discrepancy and dispute the transaction and then I just don't dispute it back and then all funds are accounted for everything is fine?

If I didn't genuinely need this money to avoid going homeless, I'd have told him a few minutes ago. But if you witness a crime, you arn't legally obligated to inform authorities you just witnessed a crime, just morally? If even that i you ask 50% of the human population.

Idk if in 24 hours that money in my account will be revoked because his check bounced or if this is all a big misunderstanding but what I don't want to do is tell this guy ""you messed up"" shouldn't be my job his job was to be a professional like I wouldn't have sold him my collection if I knew his check would bounce? And so let's say he does send me a second payment, what then? Like, I'm not committing fraud am I?

I dont think i am, for instance in the automotive industry its common to upsell people on the cost of the parts and say more things are broken than actually are in order to maximize profits, but that's not illegal!?! What is illegal- is selling the repair services, without performing the repairs. So it doesn't matter how much of that stuff was actually broken or what the work was worth, the only thing that matters is whether or not the services that were sold were performed. And even then, its perfectly legal and acceptable for the thousands of dollars of work you just had done, to not actually fix any of your problems, and then they can sell you even more work. idk how that relates to my situation but it seemed worth mentioning.

He got the collection, he payed me, I said it was his, and now he's saying he needs to pay me more. Am I legally obligated to tell him he is not? Should I just wait a few days? literally any insight or advice or corrections or wisdom would be appreciated here",Substantial-Day-5482,2,0,0.5

I have a disability (ADHD) covered under the ADA and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). 

I spoke with my doctor, and we provided paperwork to my employer to request full-time continuance of work from home as an accomodation. We used to be completely remote and are now transitioning to hybrid. We have years of documentation showing that pre-WFH, I was already struggling to remain focused/not distracted by people etc at work. I spent most of my days in private rooms to prevent being distracted. Yes, I have been medicated for this for years as well.

Our reasoning is: because my entire team is in a completely different country, and I don't work with anyone personally in the office I am assigned to, I am excessively prone to distraction. There is no potential loss of ""in-person networking"" and ""unofficial meeting insights"" because I don't work with anyone in this office. I am now also forced to already basically do the same thing I am at home: take all my meetings online. However, I now need to make an additional 2 hour total commute each day.

Shortly after submitting the paperwork to our company's Disability and Leaves service department, I was told my WFH request was approved and I was immediately re-designated a remote worker. I had no chance to negotiate this. As a result, my income was drastically reduced more than half, meaning I will now earn $90k **less** income a year. The large income decrease is because I work what is considered a ""premium"" area, so I already got a huge (like $50k+) increase in income as a result to offset the cost of living there. And then there's an additional ""cut"" just for being remote in general/being able to work anywhere. However, I have not moved, and my expenses will remain the same. I cannot easily relocate since I have a mortgage.

I cannot survive on a paycut this large this suddenly.

688,Traveling abroad without kids,119cnsb,"My wife and I are traveling abroad within the next week. Our children (both under 10 yrs. old) are going to be staying with family. I'm not sure it matters too much, but going on a trip abroad without the kids for the first time triggered the thought that we should probably have an estate plan that at least covers guardianship in place. Unfortunately that thought didn't come until the last minute.

We've created minor medical consent forms for each person who will help watch the kids while we're away, but in terms of a will or guardian designation for the kids, is there something we can put together that's better than nothing?

691,How Much Am I Legally Obligated to Suffer For a Failing Business/Partnership Where Other Partners Abandoned?,119cgsh,"TL;DR: Amateur partner agreement, and partners abandoned and won't do anything to help. I've asked outright and no reply. I've stuck with it but I'm at the end of my rope, and I'm out of savings in an expensive city. I can get a high-paying job and pay off the debt. **Can inactive partners sue me for damages if I have to walk away to save my health?**

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading. I made the classic mistake of going into business with friends about five years ago. I am going to describe quickly what I am already aware is a train wreck born of ignorance hubris. I am aware that I'm an awful manager, and I'm spiraling, so what's already bad is getting worse.

I am a professional in my field and two close (at the time) friends saw an opportunity they believed would be profitable. I was already practicing in the field they were interested in, but for someone else, and life was good. I told them it wasn't the right move for specific reasons, including highlighting my weaknesses, and they told tales of what our team could accomplish if we worked together. They promised to fill in the roles where I lack skills, and that includes areas of management/finances. Our partnership agreement speaks only of dreams: profit distribution and what happens if someone wants out, so essentially buying out, but nothing of responsibilities and what happens in the real world when friends go into business.

I moved to a new city to build the business, and we worked as a team to start it up, taking out substantial government-backed debt. Two years later, I was the only one left in the city and the only one doing anything except one partner was paying the credit card bill from the business account and keeping an eye on big-picture finances. That's pretty much it. I did everything else and still am. We were growing swiftly for three years, but my work-life balance was awful. I worked hard but paid myself what we agreed, which was comfortable. Less than three years in, COVID hit, and we still did okay, but our growth slowed. Expenses skyrocketed, I've made absolutely ridiculous personal sacrifices to keep the business solvent. I gave up most of my monthly pay because if we aren't earning it, we can't pay it to me. My mental health has suffered greatly, and my physical health is on the chopping block, currently. I can't get them to do anything for the business at all. Full avoidance. They barely even talk to me and presumably each other about the business, so we decided to sell it.

We are in the process of selling now, but I can't keep up anymore. I really am losing it and almost killed myself a month ago. It's too much responsibility and the risks are so great for me. Complete burnout, and I've begged for help in text/email/phone calls. The multiple times I was mentally fractured and about to die from this, nothing. I'm broke, out of savings, and their silence is deafening, but I know they are scared of the mountain of debt that we have mainly because of decisions they made before they split, like choosing a location with insanely high rent and loans to keep us afloat during COVID. The business I run pays those loans now, but if I so much as get sick or take a vacation, the business will not be able to pay them and SBA/EIDL loans come fully due.

My employees are loyal and are treated well but not good enough IMO. I don't want them to ride a sinking ship like I have for no reason. Our staffing is only enough to do the job safely and to customer expectations, no extra padding. One employee just put in her two weeks to move back home and she is the carpool driver for another other critical employee. If I don't start hiring soon, we'll be unable to conduct business in two weeks.

What are my obligations in the absence of any useful contractual agreements and full absence of useful partners? We are trying to sell, and the valuation is favorable, but I don't know how much longer I'll last. I'm here (edit: on /r/legaladvice) only because I am actually broke and don't know where to turn.  I'm no longer suicidal, but I can tell that my body is wearing down fast and the cardiovascular risk is sky high. My father has asked me to close the doors and move home, but I feel morally obligated to see this through, even though I'm not sure the outcome will be different. Can I just leave? Am I legally exposed if the business fails because I can't keep up? Are there steps I should take even though I can't afford a lawyer? Any help is appreciated, greatly, and I will provide more details if asked, but I don't want to talk your eyes off.

**If it's interesting:**

SBA loans are personally guaranteed by three partners. S Corp.

I've cut my pay so much that I can't afford rent anymore and I eat one meal a day generally.

The business never paid a dime for my healthcare and I'm on Medicaid.

The Adderall shortage is real and I am about three weeks away from being absolutely dysfunctional cognitively.

When I text my partners, they don't answer at all.

Our credit card is just going up, and will likely be cut off soon.

I have hired gig help to fill the gaps, but otherwise our expenses are just stuff to keep the business going.

698,My University Financial Aid Is Discriminating Against Me,119bonj,"Hi,

I'm a 36 year old woman in graduate school for the MAcc program and am trying to study for the CPA. 

At this point, I am fighting with the OFA (Office of Financial Aid) to release additional grad plus loans for private tutoring services (the school does not provide tutoring services for graduate classes/students), emergency housing costs (I had to move suddenly due to an unsafe/untenable situation), and CPA exam costs (astronomical) along with some dental and vision costs (minor amount).
 
Last year in November, the university announced a double-digit million budget deficit stemming from the OFA. The president stepped down a week later. I applied to their emergency fund around the time I needed to leave my apartment (run by the Student Affairs department, which has no association with OFA). TWO MONTHS later, I was told that they have a new policy where if I proceed with my application, the funds will be taken out of my future financial aid return. I also was desperate enough to apply (and approved) for private student loans and was told that since my Cost of Attendance (a federal criteria) was met, they will not allow me access to the money. I think as told that they're ""not a bank"" and to take out a personal loan. (Which I did, and that f*cker has an insane interest rate, and I have a bi-weekly auto withdrawal. I also opened up several credit cards to make ends meet. I even borrowed money from my dad who is on a fixed income due to a disability. Since last year, all budget increases were denied and ""personal judgement"" and ""we met your cost of attendance"" were used as template responses.

It ses that the entire department is a sh*tshow right now and they're covering their asses and tightening their belts. But their incompetence isn't my problem. I'm not asking for money from their wallets. And I am abiding by th f derap guidelines set for financial aid. 

Basically, I have ADHD (along with PTSD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Clinical Depression), all protected under the ADA. I've filed a complaint with Student Aid and the even spoke to their Ombudsman (she was incredibly dismissive). I also will file a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights.

706,Rental clothing app just updated their policy and might charge me for item I never received,119an17,"There's an app (very new and only in NYC) that I am using that lets you rent clothes from other people in your city, they deliver the item to your apartment and pick it up via uber. The app profits 20% from each rental and charges $5 for each delivery. I've loved the app and had no issues until I rented an item about a month ago, it says that the item was delivered (via uber) but I never received it. I have 24/7 doormen and they input every delivery or send them up directly to my door. They have no input of the delivery and checked multiple times (I've lived here over a year and never had a package/delivery go missing). The uber says that it was signed for, but they don't have access to who delivered it. They also don't have any photo evidence it was delivered. This was a $300 shirt that I rented for $35, and never got to wear. I of course asked my doormen multiple times to check and even went into the package room and found nothing. Also, the girl who I rented from apparently didn't put the item in a bag so I'm not sure if the uber person put it in a bag or not (and we can't get into contact  with them) which makes it harder to find considering it could be in a reusable bag. When I rented the item a little over a month ago, the policy was if someone rents an item from you and it is damaged or not returned you will get 5x the rental price back. It never said who was responsible for paying. Also when renting there wasn't a policy that said I am responsible for paying if the item goes missing. 

Now, it's been a month and the shirt is still lost, and I am out $35 and this girl is out of her nice shirt. I don't think it's fair to say it's either of our fault, so I think it should come down to Pickle who should pay.

Now, I looked at the app and the updated policy is ""if the item is not returned you are liable for the retail price of the item"". Which is not what it was when I rented the item. I believe they are going to make me liable for lost item which would be $300, which I don't think is fair considering I never receive the item and I believe that it is partly the fault of the girl who rented the item (she didn't put it in a bag which is a loose policy, but it I believe now is required) and the delivery person, and also the app for not requiring photo evidence. I don't mind being out $35 but paying $300 for an item I never received and is not fault of my own isn't fair, plus I would think twice about renting a very expensive item if I'm responsible for mishaps with delivery. Of course if I damaged the dress or if I never returned the item that would make sense but that's not the case.

I don't have any evidence of the old policy, but the website is different from the app and says if an item is lost or completely damaged the renter is liable for 5x the rental price or 90% of retail value"" which is also vague.

714,A pipe burst in my house and my landlord is telling me i have to pay it all myself to fix it or i have to move out completely.,1199n8q,"Basically last tuesday my a pipe under my fridge and dishwasher burst and has been leaking water. I've been forced to close down my pipe and only open it on rare occasions. I had a plumber come over to check it out and he said I'd have to take out my fridge and dishwasher completely to dig up the pipe and fix it. However when I told my landlord he told me he wouldnt pay for it and gave me two options; Or i can move out to someplace else or I can pay for it all (it'll cost close to 10 thousand). Is there anything i can do here?   
I really don't have the choice to move out because of my job i'd be too far away and I really can't afford to pay for it all.

717,Debt collections,1199du1,"So long story short- I am in PA and I have an item in collections that is from my old apartment and was sold to a debt collector. It was my old apartment that we (my now ex-husband and I) broke the lease early on for a number of reasons. We had a payment arrangement for the last months rent to be paid off since we were leaving early. I gave my husband at the time the money to pay the apartment and I thought that was that. 



Well apparently he pocketed the money and never paid them so now I’ve been sent to collections. This is ruining my credit as I’ve only just started building credit a year ago, I have one card with a $300 limit that I pay off monthly and they will not increase my limit, I don’t qualify for a loan or another card and my credit score will not go above 600 no matter how hard I try. And no I cannot get anyone to co-sign something for me to build credit. I’ve tried. This debt is weighing me down and I want to get rid of it. It’s almost $1000 that I don’t have to just pay off. And it’s the only negative thing on my credit. 


Am I responsible for the full amount even tho we are both signed on the debt? Or would I only owe half the debt? How do I make sure I’m dealing with the debt collector correctly and it’ll actually be removed? I know for a fact he will never pay a penny and doesn’t care because he has lots in collections.",nootdoot,0,1,1.0

During the deal I was asked if I had been a student within the last 2 years, I said yes (graduated 2021), they told me I earned a $500 discount. No other questions were asked, just that I would need to prove I went/graduated. 

3 months later my car is ready, I ask about the final price and they confirm it. I go to the bank and got a certified cheque for the amount and handed it to them. While I am signing the contracts they ask me to send a scan of my degree to them, I say ok soon as I get home I'll send an email.  I pay, sign and leave with my car.

Now the dealer is saying I don't qualify for the discount because my degree is not on a list of GM approved schools.  My school is approved by my country as an accredited institution and I can prove it.   The dealer also says since I earned my degree in only 1 year it also doesn't count (I transferred credits).

Do they have any ground to stand on and do I owe $500? Or can I tell the dealer to kick rocks ?

719,Cousin jumped with brass knuckles in Tennessee,1199ba4,"Hello, I’m posting this to help out my cousin. This all happened in Tennessee. It’s a very small county, I’m weary to post the name of it because of how small it is because I don’t want any kind of retaliation. Brass knuckles were used (I think this is illegal) and the woman who assaulted my cousin has been involved in another serious, previous incident as well.

My cousin was jumped with brass knuckles in Tennessee. This happened because my cousin (30f) messaged a business profile on Facebook about a quote for a drive way paving. The man that owned the business drove to my cousins house with his girlfriend (26f). My cousin was asked to get into the car to “discuss the estimate” because they needed to see the driveway in person. Upon doing this, the girlfriend accused my cousin of “trying to steal her man” and smashed my cousin’s head into the middle console of the car and began beating her in the face and head repeatedly with brass knuckles. The business owner (the boyfriend) recorded the entire assault. This left my cousin with a broken nose, 2 black eyes, and complete facial swelling & bruising, as well as a gash on the forehead.
The police did not arrest the woman who assaulted my cousin. They refuse to do so until it goes before a judge and the judge decides. The sheriff’s office have confiscated the man’s phone and have the video, they have the brass knuckles. This same girl who assaulted my cousin has previously beat up another woman until the woman had a seizure. Nothing was done in this case either. 

I’m just trying to see if there is anything else that can be done to get some kind of action taken against this woman? Why would they not arrest her and insist on waiting for “the judge to decide”?",Tiny__Oreo,1,0,0.5

Now that the NLRB has ruled that non-disparagement and confidentiality clauses are illegal, I'm considering signing my separation agreement.

I received the 60 day notice in which I will receive full pay and benefits until the end of that period OR until I find a new job. I'm wondering if that second part is enforceable once I sign the agreement. I would much rather receive the full 60 days of pay instead of the 2 weeks severance pay, if I were to find a job soon. 

This is what it says:

    2. Notice Period, Wages, Salary, and Expenses. In addition to the Separation Amount set forth above, Employee understands that Employee will be paid Employee’s regular base salary, less applicable taxes and withholdings, for sixty (60) days ending [removed] (“Notice Period”), whether Employee enters into this Agreement or not.

They informed the officer of why they are requesting this as they were very visible to their employer.  The officer did not/would not turn them off. The driver and officer were in a private parking lot with no through traffic, so leaving the strobing lights on was not a safety issue regarding visibility or anything like that.  I guess my real question is does an officer have to leave their lights on by law? Can they turn them off at the drivers request if there are no safety issues at play?

727,Tenant snuck in violent sublet into my house (duplex) without telling me,1198bnk,"This is in Minnesota. I own a duplex. Each side has four bedrooms,  two baths,  two staircases,  a pantry, servants' quarters in the attic,  a large kitchen, and three porches.   As a favor to a friend,   I rented to his grandsons and one of their friends. I gave them a break on the rent if they did chores.  For various reasons------(death threats), and a guy they snuck into the house without my permission------I threw the grandsons and their friend out.   There was one kid left who seemed nice.  

&nbsp; 

I got a couple more tenants,  then Leftover Guy moved his GF  baby in. She was a lovely girl,  and the other two kids just worked,  slept,  shoveled snow for me. 

&nbsp; 

Omitting extraneous details,   I had to call the police one night because I heard and felt large thuds and shouting.  That's when I discovered Leftover Guy had moved a friend of his in the house *months* ago.  He had not paid rent,   obviously,  nor a deposit.  He drank a lot,  and he was violent. He's a big guy,  along with his friend,  but I and the other tenants are not. The cops told me he had established tenancy (by staying there without my knowledge or permission?) He'd kicked holes into 110-year-old lath-and-plastic walls.  No deposit obviously. 

&nbsp;

I told him he had two weeks to get out and he had moved in illegally.   I suspect he's smoking weed & meth,  and Leftover Guy is underage but drinking.  

&nbsp; 

The lease was basic.:Month-to-month,  no pets,  no guests longer than a certain number of days,  no illegal activities,   no damage. I've owned the house for almost five years,   had one repair over three sets of tenants,  and with this bunch I've had them *not* tell me about a leak for five days causing all kinds of damage in the walls,  floors, and ceiling;  somehow break a toilet,  stuff paper towels and baby wipes down the toilet after I told them not, causing both basements to flood,  mine worse than theirs.  

&nbsp; 

I gave the wall-kicker notice two weeks ago, on video,   and today is his last day.  Spare guy gave me rent but asked if he could stay  a bit longer because his new apartment wouldn't be ready on the first.   Also,   they leave their doors unlocked, despite me telling them to lock and close them.  

&nbsp; 

I have no money.  I just had a radiator break on my side,  flooding the living room below,   but thanks to having VERY old kitties,  I had a lot of puppy pads on hand,  which saved the day.   New radiators cost $3000 minus labor.  There was asbestos.  I *have* called my insurance company & learned my home warranty is a scam. Oh,  and all business was conducted via text.

732,Contract Cancelation by Seller,1197x5r,"I went under contract on a home a few weeks ago, and after the inspection, I attempted to renegotiate. The home did not pass a four-point and had active termites. In the state of Florida, it is illegal to sell a home with termites, and you cannot obtain financing without a clean, four-point inspection. There were also some foundational issues that were uncovered, and it turned out that only one window in the home was actually operable, this included the bedroom windows not working, which impacts even being able to call them bedrooms with no working egress windows. 

Anyhow, I asked for $20,000 back at closing, and of course, the house to be fumigated and the electrical panel updated so we could obtain financing. All other terms were to remain the same. The sellers (who happen to be realtors), rejected everything over and over again until the last day of our inspection period. I signed the cancellation doc to protect our earnest deposit, and sent over a final offer along with it, asking them please except one or the other. 

They chose to accept my offer, told me the cancelation would be disregarded, asked me to resend the offer without the cancelation attached and created an addendum based on our request, and we all signed it. 

The following day they sent me a new addendum telling me they were refusing to pay for the garage door replacement, which was part of the original contract and MLS listing. They also wanted $5000 back! I told them “no” and they threatened to cancel the contract on me if I didn’t sign. I told them I would speak with my attorney and let them know how I would like to proceed. 

The following day I got a third addendum from them saying they agreed to “repair” the garage door. I again declined to sign the addendum until I had an attorney look at it, and until they could tell me exactly what “repair” the garage door meant. That’s far different than “replace” the garage door, which I already had in the original contract. What happen next blows my mind… 

They had taken the cancellation document they told me would be “disregarded” when we signed the addendum to move forward with the purchase, and pasted it into a new e-sign document, then had the sellers sign it without my knowledge prior to them signing the addendum that we all signed.  I’m still able to access the original cancelation doc they created, and it is still unsigned by all parties other than myself. I was also able to obtain the logs from the document they sent to title, and shocker, my name, and IP address are nowhere to be found in the logs. They clearly pasted the discarded document in and signed it without my knowledge. Additionally, I have text on text about moving forward, the appraisal needing scheduled even them telling me the fumigaron was scheduled and the electrician had made my the repairs and to have my inspector come back.  

I obviously need to speak with a lawyer (or two) today, but if anyone in here can give me some advice, or knows anything about this, please let me know.

However, she started researching it and in total, between having it drafted and our respective legal representation, it may cost between $8-10k total. 

Here's the thing: we're both middle class and have no real assets. We rent, have pretty equal amounts of debt, and own nothing of serious value (I have a car, but it's worth less than the prenup). She's digging her heels in and is insistent that we move forward and pay what it costs - she's going to get some financial help from her family to pay for her part. She's been sold because a friend of hers is going through a divorce and wishes she had a prenup beforehand. We live in New York for additional state law context.

Morally, I'm not opposed to a prenup on principle. I am opposed to wasting thousands of dollars. So, I'm wondering:

1) How much more money is it just get divorced? Do you still have to pay hefty legal fees anyway? 

2) It's recommended that we both get lawyers to represent each of our interests. Can I just sign it myself after reading it and forgo my portion of the legal representation to save money? I know it's a ""stupid"" move, but I trust her to draft something fair.

* I contacted Amazon about it by chat & email expecting them to just resolve the problem, and they told me to file a police report in order to get any help with the issue.
* I called customer service and spent about an hour speaking to a couple of different agents about the issue, and they basically told me the same thing. I asked to speak to a manager, who then proceeded to go off on me and berate me about how ""You can't prove that the warehouse made a mistake"" and ""If you want your money back you have to take it up with the police"".
* I filed the police report and sent it to them, and after a couple of emails asking for information I had already provided multiple times in the previous communications, the emails stopped coming.
* I contacted my credit card company to dispute the transaction, they did their thing, and towards the end of January they told me that the dispute was found in my favor and the transaction has been reversed.
* 2 days ago, they (credit card) sent me another message saying that they unreversed the transaction based on documents provided by Amazon, which when I looked at these documents there are details about the order I made, but the items I am disputing are not even listed in these documents. They only show the rest of the items from the order, and a return invoice for 2 (different) items that I returned a few days after receiving them.
* The credit card company said that their policy is that if the merchant provides documentation then they undo the reversal, which makes absolutely no sense to me since these documents show nothing relevant.
* I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau today, including basically all of the documentation I had on this up to now.

I have cameras at my house, but when I reviewed the footage it only shows the delivery guy dropping off the package and me picking it up. It doesn't show me opening the packages and finding them to be empty. 

&#x200B;

What can I do here? It seems like Amazon is basically committing to fight me on this, and I understand Black Friday was a busy period for them and they probably have fraud cases like this all the time, but I'm being completely serious about all of this. The package was sealed when I received it so it seems pretty clear that it was not tampered with in transit, but the duplicate serial number on the boxes plus the fact that they weren't official manufacturer's packaging (the products were from Western Digital) seems like more than enough to me to suggest there was a mistake at the warehouse because those guys were probably working double and triple shifts to get through Black Friday/Christmas, but as rude as that manager was I guess she's technically right that I can't prove it.

740,Legal work maternity help,11976wy,"Hello

I was on maternity leave from March 2022 til December 2023 with my second child. 

During my maternity leave 2 people in the same role (different accounts) joined my company. 

As a side note I have worked with my company for 7 years and have indept knowledge on the industry and my accounts are collected worth more than 2 million in revenue. 

We also had an internalisation with the company who bought ours in 2019 and in doing so they gave all Account Managers in our company a pay rise to meet with the bigger companies counter part colleague. 

This pay rise is 6 grand more than what I’m currently on and I have just found this out. 

I am the only Account Manager on the lower wage which was given during my maternity leave.

I feel like this is unfair and if it’s a company alignment should I also be a part of it but it’s clear they are potentially getting away with it with me. 

Or they aren’t and I am not entitled to the increase in pay as I was on maternity leave.

Please can someone with knowledge advise how I could or even if I should approach this? Do I have a case?

742,Stuck between a noncompete with the company I work for and the client they contract me to? [NE],11973n5,"Location: Nebraska

I work in a service-related industry for a multistate employer who contracts my services exclusively to a specific client. The board of directors for the client to whom I am contracted out, however, is looking at switching to a different service company but would like to keep me as the person providing that service. However, my actual employer had me sign a noncompete agreement that would restrict me from soliciting work for other clients of this particular nature in a 60mi radius for two years after leaving this employer. My questions are:

1) am I *soliciting* a contract with this new company to work for the same client, since the board is the ones looking to change service providers and *they* approached *me* about keeping me on with this client?

2) outside of my particular situation, is this noncompete clause even enforceable, when (per my understanding) Nebraska restricts noncompetes to specifically clients who the employee has dealings with during their time with the company that the noncompete is for, and the noncompete I signed asserts a much broader scope of clients I can and cannot work for? 

3) the company I work for's immediate predecessor who worked with this client was let go, and now has work under a different company with a client who is blocks away, far from the 60mi radius that is specified in the noncompete. Would my company's failure to enforce their noncompete clause with the previous contractor have an effect on their legal ability to do so with me?",-y-y-y-,0,1,1.0

750,Wage theft advice,11968ne,"I’m going to try to be as detailed as possible because I don’t know what information will be pertinent. 

The short version: my job has been docking hours from my checks for the last 7 paychecks, and although I bring it up to them repeatedly (and they say they’ll fix it) I haven’t seen any of the money repaid. 

The long version:

I’ve worked at an HVAC company for over a year and a half now. We use an app called service titans for dispatching and for payroll. We are typically not paid for drive time to/from home, but if the drive time is longer than 45 mins I get paid the extra (so example, a 50 min drive pays me 5 minutes) the app is shoddy at best for recording hours, however. 

Up until recently, I would have a paystub missing 2-3 hours, maybe once a month. I would talk to our payroll person and it would be fixed, I would get the money direct deposited the next week, or in a check if I needed it sooner. It was irritating, but not a huge problem.

Recently, there has been a massive change in personnel at our office. At the same time, I have been having payroll discrepancies far more frequently. Situations such as Working late, clocking in a second time if I was called back to work, and going on call for the weekends have been especially unreliable for recording hours worked.

For whatever reason, I have had hours missing from my last 7 paychecks. Every week when I see this, I go to payroll and my manager, and I tell them the correct times I have clocked in and clocked out (I have photos of every single clock in and clock out due to this issue being so frequent) and they always say they will fix it, but I never see the money, or any correspondence other than “we will fix it”

After so many weeks, I grew impatient and put my 2 weeks notice in. To no surprise, the discrepancies continued. Now I am getting no answers from my boss (I will only communicate via text message at this point so it may be documented) and today is my last day. On top of that, they’ve had no appointments (or work) for me to do these last 3 days, so I haven’t even been in to the office. Since I am getting ghosted, and my payroll discrepancies keep piling up (I’m owed over $500 now), I’m considering going to the department of labor to get my money back. 

Is this a good/bad idea? Is there anything else I should know or do before I take action?

Edit: I also forgot to mention that 3 weeks ago we were sat down during a meeting and told that all drive time was now paid. It was my manager that told me this, and the company owner was present.

1 week ago the paystub ( being the paystub for 2 weeks ago) had removed all of our paid drive time. They have gps trackers that they measure against our clock ins/outs. We were never told that this new policy had been reneged, and a coworker found out this was the case after speaking with payroll. I am now aware that this is the case, but I was never notified formally or informally of this policy change. Also, the policy change was clearly applied retroactively. Is this legal?

I set up appointment with one auto body shop and the person never came. He offered to do check my issue for free. I had called over 6 shops and they all said they will check this for free.

There was one next door so I just went there.

It has **no** cost.

While car is still lifted, she asks for $50 diagnostic fee. She wanted cash and I didn't have any so a card was used. Looking back it, the car was basically held hostage by that shop.

Also, the mech was **completely wrong** on his diagnosis and literally gave me my key with his dirty hands.

What kind of legal rights do I have to this information? Can she force him to give it to her? I have not sent any of it to him in case he forgets and gives it all to her. I have no issue with him having it. If she asks for access to things and he says no, does she have the right to do it anyway?

Does that mean that we would NOT be able to collect on damages caused by them outside of the scope of work listed in the contract? For example, if they damage any part of my property that is not listed in contract and/or if their work needs to be redone/replaced we are responsible for any costs beyond what’s listed in the contact?

Also, if we had to sue for any reason, will this prohibit us from being able to collect on legal fees?

775,Never received 2021 tax return unsure how to proceed,1194y6e,"My wife and I file a married/joint tax return and for the year 2021 (filed in April 2022) we had a 6 digit tax national tax-return (which is a very meaningful amount for us). We prepared and filed our taxes through Intuit and the source of all of our issues starts at the point where we selected payment through the refund. 

A few weeks after filing we got our state return and then in July we wondered where our national return was and went to the IRS website and tracked our refund and it said it was send back in May. We contacted our bank and they said no deposit was made at any point. So then we went back to the IRS (in person) and the great employee there went above and beyond and said that the payment actually went first to TPG (a bank/company that handles the payment stuff with Intuit). After literal hours on hold with TPG we got them to trigger a ""refund to the IRS"" and they said it could take 90-120 days. 

Now in Feb '23 we still don't have the return so we again went to IRS/TPG to try to figure out what happened. TPG said a refund was triggered to the IRS in Sept '22. The IRS said to us they did not receive anything and is starting an ""investigation"" which is a 90-120 day timer again.

776,My car loan was paid off by someone (I don't know who) and I received the title and now want to sell the car [GA].,1194wck,"About a month ago, the lease on my car (Car A) was ending, and I wanted to purchase the car as I had positive equity in the lease and wanted to use it as a trade-in for another vehicle (Car B). I went to the dealer where I leased Car A and they set up a 48-month loan for me on Car A through a 3rd party lender (a national bank). The next day, I went to a different dealer to purchase Car B, but they couldn't do the trade-in because the lender didn't have a record of my loan on Car A. I decided to go ahead with purchasing Car B as Car B dealer said they would purchase Car A from me once the loan had been processed. I signed a power of attorney form and an odometer statement at Car B dealer and left Car A with them in anticipation that we could finalize the sale of Car A in a few days.

After two weeks, the lender still had no record of my account, so I reached out to the dealer who set up the loan on Car A; apparently, they had made a mistake in my address so I needed to re-sign all the documents so they could re-submit to the lender. I did this and, the next day, the loan showed up with the lender. I was now ready to sell Car A to Car B dealer, but a new problem emerged: two days after the auto loan was opened, it was paid in full and now had a $0 balance. 

Since I did not pay off the loan, I spent a lot of time talking to the lender about what happened. But all they could tell me was that the loan had been paid off; they could not tell me who paid off the loan. When I asked how the payment happened, they said they had received a check. To me, this meant they should be able to tell me who wrote the check, but they said they could not do that. So someone--I have no idea who--has paid off my car loan in full. I also have records from the lender showing that the loan for Car A was paid in full via check and the account has no balance.

Ten days after the balance went to $0, the lender closed the account and mailed me the clean title to Car A. Now that I have the title for Car A, I want to finally sell it to Car B dealer as Car A has been sitting at Car B dealer for more than a month. And the longer I wait to sell Car A, the more it will depreciate in value; I'm also having to pay for insurance on Car A since it's still registered to me. 

So here are my questions: Is there any legal problem with me selling Car A, for which I now hold a clean title (even though I don't know who actually paid off the loan)? If the loan is re-opened because there was an error somewhere, can I be sued by whoever paid off the loan? And, if so, can they sue me for more than the original amount of the loan?",No_Major_2829,4,2,1.0
777,[NYC] Rules regarding advance notice of non-emergency construction work for co-op residents?,1194sri,"Hi! I've searched this forum before posting and found that questions related to this issue come up a lot, but I have not seen anyone asking or answering the specific question I have: 

I live in a NYC co-op with a terrace. Last week, a bunch of workers showed up on my terrace to begin doing facade work on the building. This work is required by law and a matter of safety - I have no issue with them doing the work. My concern is that we were never notified that it would be happening, or that anyone would need access to our terrace. We found out when we woke up and discovered contractors walking around out on our terrace. 

I've since learned that this work has been planned for several months - this is not a situation where an emergency was suddenly recognized and access was needed unexpectedly. In that case, **was my co-op's management company (or anyone else) required to provide any advance notice of the fact that they plan on doing work/would be in my space?** If so, how much notice were they required to provide? Would this be governed by our co-op lease, or are there any relevant laws requiring that we receive advance notice of the work to be done in our space? I read the wiki here and found [this link indicating that there is no statute regarding notice requirements in NY State](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/chart-notice-requirements-enter-rental-29033.html), but I was wondering if NYC might have its own rules.

I have no intention of trying to stop or disrupt this work. The reason for my question is that despite repeated requests to the management company for more information, they have yet to send me any further info about the project. If there was any requirement for them to provide us with advance notice, I hope to raise that issue as a way of getting their attention just so they will send me the relevant permits, project plans, or whatever other documentation they may have so I can understand the scope and expected length of the project (they told me the workers will be on our terrace ""every day, weather permitting"" but not how long ""every day"" will last for). There is nothing posted in the building lobby or anywhere else that I have seen. I was able to find some info, including a work permit, on the DOB's website - but nothing about the expected timeframe for the project (the permit says something about ""as per plans filed herewith"" but the DOB's site does not seem to have the plans being referred to).

The leech field (part of the septic) in the house we bought failed within a month and a half of us moving in. Nothing could drain. It was dead of winter, and therefor no showers, no toilet, no running water. We lived like this for 6 months, I’ll spare you the details, while we waited for a local contractor to give the thumbs up they could do the work when the ground thawed/dried out. 

I applied to every loan imaginable, tried for grants, etc but no one would approve me since I had A. Just gotten out of the military, B. Started a new job, and C. Just sold my house in another state. The contractor said “we’ll work something out” 

That was June 2022 when they put in the new leech field. 

I received an estimate, but I didn’t sign anything and by NO MEANS am I trying to get out of paying! 

We had been giving this local contractor a check each month up until today, when the company called to tell us that “this never should have been done this way” and “we’re not a bank” and demanding I pay over double a month what I’ve been paying or they’re going to “turn it over to collections”

780,Can I use my U.S. Social Security Number for a Bank Application as a Non U.S. Citizen or Resident?,1194jn2,"Hey guys! Afternoon.
Hope everyone is very very well.
I’m new on this incredible forum, a pleasure to be here with you all.

Very respectfully, I ask:

Can I use my U.S. Social Security Number for a Bank Application as a NON U.S. Citizen or Resident?

To briefly summarize and give some context to my personal position:

I was born and raised in South America. I had the blessing of completing my Superior Studies in the United States of America together to also… working legally through different work permits as an International Student. 

Such incredible experience of work + study overseas lasted nearly 10 years. One of the first things I did… was opening an account on an U.S Bank which lasted me nearly 9 years till today in which I have received a “Notice of Closing” Letter from my Bank which is in summary… closing my account due to undisclosed reasons. 

My guess to the “reason”? The account is getting closed due to the amount of transactions (more specifically… in “Zelle”) that both I and my Father (Main Account above my Account) had made.

Not only did we possibly utilize our Personal accounts as if they were Business Accounts (many earnings and expenses) but also, our country of Citizenship is sadly famous for Money Laundering and corrupt people. Therefore, I guessed we simply got marked as suspicious and as a result… closed.

When I opened my Account (9 years ago) I had NO Social just yet.

Now, I have NO Bank Account but I do have my Social BUT I’m NOT a U.S Citizen not a Resident. What would you do in my Position?

What’s the “type of Lawyer” that could hopefully guide me please?

I’ve never done anything ilegal or incorrect against either ethics or the Law. My biggest fear would be to do a mistake with a country that’s not my own and that I so deeply admire and respect. My gratitude to all readers

791,"Cleaning hoarder’s hoard, need advice",119311q,"Hello. I currently live in my childhood home, my mother, who is a hoarder, was moved out recently (a year ago). She still has her hoard in our attic however, which is a huge attic, packed to the ceiling, with only a small 4 x 2 foot section cleared so far. 

I am attempting to clean the attic, by dumping garbage. Her belongings have been dropped off to her house for her to sort through, and she has been told if she wants to keep anything in our attic that’s fine- but she needs to put it in uniform size boxes that we can easily stack in the corner of the attic. We have not allowed her in the attic to clean it herself as she hasn’t asked to, and the times she has before, she just leaves the attic a mess and doesn’t box her stuff up and leaves it in huge piles that topple over. We did tell her she was free to enter to get her things to take home as long as we were home (aka- no coming in our house with a key, unsupervised). 

Now she’s accusing us that our own garbage (I also have quite a bit of stuff in the attic of mine that she hoarded- like empty toy boxes that I obviously have a right to dump) is actually full of her valuables like her electronics and mother/father’s things. We showed her the attic to show that we haven’t even gotten to that section yet, and even let her tear open the garbage, but she doesn’t believe us. This started after we dumped a purse of hers that was torn and covered in rats piss, which we offered to get out of the trash for her anyways if she wanted it. 

She is becoming increasingly hostile. We told her from now on we can leave all our garbage bags at her boyfriends house (no room at her house or ours- we’re clearly upwards of 10-12 bags a day) so she can sort through them before they get dumped. She’s refusing to do this. She has threatened to break into our house twice now, and we fear she may show up with her boyfriend & that we’re going to have to call the police.

What is our legal responsibility here? Is leaving them at her house/the garbage to sort through at her house/her boyfriends reasonable? As well as allowing (just her-no boyfriend) in the house under our supervision to retrieve her things? I feel like we’ve given her reasonable outlets.

792,seeking asylum in the US,1192w66,"I am considering leaving my home country of Russia once I turn 18, which is going to be quite soon, in a few months. I'm going to list some details about my case and would like to ask whether I would likely be granted asylum. This is hypothetical so far, but life has been tiring here.

The most obvious reason is political disagreement. I went to a protest against war and got detained. While I was proven 'innocent' since there was no proof I was actually protesting, the legal system has some of my social media accounts and my e-mail address which they possibly monitor. It is very much possible that should I post anything remotely anti-war/Putin on those accounts, I could be held accountable in a court. Even though I'm a minor.
I have many Ukrainian friends and acquaintances, even distant family, and seeing them suffer has been a nightmare. My mental health has significantly worsened.

Second thing - I am a lesbian. While, thankfully, most people in my life are accepting, the government is not. It is now illegal to ""propagate"" being LBGT+, which in practice means expressing any support towards the community. I'm an artist, and sexuality, as well as political beliefs being a huge part of my life, is something I want to be able to express freely. I cannot. Even if I come out publicly, I could face discrimination in the workplace, education etc. It's a norm here.

Third thing is being Jewish. Although legally there is no persecution of Jews specifically, it's no secret that some officials in the gov-t have expressed their anti-Semitic beliefs. While that is also true for the US, there criticism of this would me fitting. Here bringing this kind of stuff up could land you with a sentence. I have experienced verbal anti-Semitism on quite a few occasions as well.

Fourth thing might not be relevant, but I am technically mentally disabled. I have chronic depression and BPD, and Russia is NOT inclusive at all when it comes to these things. Because of my panic attacks I had to leave school and be homeschooled, and for YEARS all school stuff protested. I have been insulted and ridiculed in schools many times for not being able to do certain things because of these things.

There is this specific patient that our CEO is linked to because he knows the family. The patient has been admitted before and the request directly from our CEO is to ""work with the doctor to have him conserved at the request of the patient's family"" 

Is this legal? No one on our team feels like this patient is anywhere near being conservable, he is not gravely disabled and is high functioning but it feels like coercion coming from so high up.

798,Home insurance company is giving me 2 months to remove overhanging tree branches [PA],1192fg4,"        I hope this is the right place to post this. I live in a small PA town. My neighbor has 3 or 4 massive trees in their yard, I’m not sure how to even estimate their size, but they are higher than my house and overhang probably 3 or 4 different properties. 
        My home insurance company has recently sent me a letter saying I need to remove the overhanging branches that are above my house and property or they will drop me. 
        I have so many questions, and I haven’t talked to my neighbor about it yet, just because I’d like to have as much information as I can before I do. These trees could cost thousands to have professionally removed, if my neighbor was even willing to remove them. They’re (the trees) in a very hard to reach place (couldn’t be removed with a simple bucket truck parked on the street) and our yards are all hills. The branches I would need to remove are very high up and I would have no way to get to them to even begin removing them. 
       So, assuming my neighbor declines to pay to have their trees trimmed/removed professionally, what are my options? Can I get my local borough council to compel the tree removal? Will I have to pay to have my neighbors trees removed? I just have no idea where to start, all help is appreciated.",SidewaysTreee,3,0,0.33

801,Couple I adopted a Kitten from ask for her back,1191w0g,"I posted this in r/Pets but a couple people recommended I post here.

TL;DR: I adopted a kitten from a couple who after almost 2 weeks asked for her back because I changed her name.

Quick facts:
-We all live in Bernalillo County, New Mexico 
-the Kitten currently has a chip in their names
-I have paid the most recent vet bill and I have possession of all her past vacation records.
-I know they kept many animals in a small bathroom although I do not have proof.
-I do however have screenshots of them acknowledging I adopted the cat and even commenting on how my kitten makes me smile.

I adopted a kitten from this couple who I was mutual friends with. Some drama happened midway through that may be playing a part although they have not brought it up directly even when I asked if it was related. 

After having the kitten (she is four months) for so long and getting her adjusted to her new name, I asked then to call her Raven. I expressed intent to name her Raven before they released her into my care so I am unsure why this became a problem but I had put my foot down because all my animals have a theme with their names, first Feather, then Crow, now Raven. 

They told me to give Raven back, that the microchip was in their name, the younger one repeated that their ""mom said give the cat back"" (the couple is 18 and 27 but they both have the mental maturity of younger person, not a dig that's just a fact). I told them to call the police if they wanted and they asked for my address which I did not give. They technically should have it as I had given it before although I do not think thats my legal responsibility. They kept spamming me all night, the older one tried to guilt me by claiming Raven was her emotional support animal (she was not legally at least) and implied that me keeping the cat they gave me was some form of emotional abuse.

Nonetheless, I have blocked them.

Legally, what I think I know is in NM animals are private property and they surrendered their private property and I have proof so I should be okay if they do take me to small claims court. I also have zero clue if I am right so figured a post here couldn't hurt.",Sufficient_Summer871,10,38,0.83

805,Rights to mothers will,1191b8b,"Hello, I have a question about my mothers will. My mother is in the care of my older sister and her husband. She has named my older sister legal guardian of all her money. I have had to call the state to check on my mom one time because my sister (and her husband) were not paying her bills like my mother thought. I confronted my mother with this info. My older sister then told me a totally different story than what the bill company said and would not let me talk to my mom for about 2 weeks. This is when I learned about elder abuse and how to spot it. I was terrified and could barely sleep so I called the state to check on her as it was all I could do bc I live in a different state and cannot check myself, nor did I feel safe to. 

I am blamed for trying to ruin their reputation and my mother is so “embarrassed” by this. She is still mad at me…not at sister and husband for not paying bills, they had a good story. I did it bc I was genuinely worried. Bc my mom felt the need to reprimand me, she says I’m not in the will. It hurts but I’ve never put too much stock into monetary things so I don’t let it bother me. I try and text my mother from time to time just to make sure she is ok, which her health is declining after she had a heart valve surgery that the doctors say should make her feel at least 10 yrs younger. I have tried to let her know to check the meds she is taking and to not have blind faith in anything or anyone as that is how elder abuse starts. She gets very defensive. She has no friends to check up on her…I am the only one and the situation is fishy. Talking to my sister is out of the question. She hates me and calls me a failure and liar through texts. There was one time I texted her before Xmas to let her know I’m here if she wants to reach out about things with no return text. I’m afraid my kindness makes her more mad at me. I have to keep away for my mental health too as she is very degrading. 

My question is, with all of this possible non-important backstory (sorry just wanted you to know where I’m coming from), do I have any right to my mothers will bring her daughter, even if I am “written out of it” as she states.

My husband got into an accident. He was driving on a 3 lane and someone who was on the right lane that is supposed to be for only making right turns merged into his lane at the intersection and applied the brakes abruptly. 

In order to avoid hitting them straight on, my husband swerved right but the left side of the car took a hit still. The other truck kept on going and there was no camera there and no witnesses stopped. 

A police office came when he called but said he wouldn’t do a report as there’s no camera and witnesses but gave his card in case insurance needs to contact him for questions.

5. They messed up the wiring in my lights. I'm having to take it to ANOTHER mechanic to fix the lights, they said they checked all the lights to make sure they worked. Two don't, blinker and break light.

I'm having some issues with the house I'm living in. This is in Berlin, Germany.

I'm staying here with a sublease contract, which is tied to my flatmate's contract, he is the main tenant of the house.
We spoke about it and he wanted to let me have a new contract with the company, so that I can continue living there.

He gave the landlord company a notice that he's leaving 3 months ago, as he's supposed to, letting them also know that I'm interested in taking over, but they never contacted us until last week, and didn't even tell us much.

Yesterday, we spoke to a lady from the company, and she said someone is going to come to check the house, and discuss any possibility for a new contract with my name on it.

The issue is that she said we're going to have to completely EMPTY the apartment, so that the guy can check it out, and then a couple of weeks later, IF they decide to give me the contract, I can move back in.
But I want to stay here, and it doesn't make sense to take everything out and then back in again.

Everyone of my peers has told me to stay in here without moving the stuff out and to tell the guy that I'm registered here, and they can't throw me out like this, I should have priority over other potential tenants, and that if he wants to check the place I'll be happy to move stuff around until he's seen what he needs.

I said I had a store full of people and I couldn't do it right then and that it is was so urgent he shouldn't have left in the middle of the day. 

He came back to the store red in the face,  huffing and puffing with his fists clenched. Demanded I sit down and proceeded to scream about how utterly disrespectful I am and it's none of my business when he comes or goes. I was afraid he was going to hit me as he has talked at length about riding with 1% bike gangs  and fist fighting all the time.  So i called his boss two days later.

I told her that he has been leaving the store after only a couple hours, about how aggressively he confronted me and my fear of violence. I told her that the other employees have complained to me about being told to come in on their day off and if they don't they're fired and then as soon as they got to the store he left for the day.

Then the girl who complained about me comes into the store to talk to me. Yes I audio and video recorded the entire conversation and there were witnesses to this and she told me that..

She never talked to hr until they called her.

My girlfriend (gf) who was passenger and myself (driver) were driving on an unsealed (allowed by cover) main road in a remote part of Australia (FYI we drive left hand side in AU). We were about to enter a right hand, 90 degree, uphill corner travelling way under the limit (I’d say 10-15kph in a 60kph zone) when I saw a vehicle travelling the other direction down the hill carrying way to much speed. I steered off towards the side of the road and came to a stop. They locked up their brakes and went into a slide, overshot the corner onto our side of the road and we had a head on collision. Airbags went off and gf and I luckily walked it off with grazes from the airbags and my gf has whiplash and a stiff neck plus seat belt graze. THANK FUCK. 

Anyway other driver is with 2 other vehicles / mates on their 4WD adventure. After shock wears off they all help us tow our car off the road to a safe spot. We don’t have any mobile reception so get our luggage out of the rental car and guy who hit us gives us a lift to the closest town with reception. His car is a 4wd fitted with bull bar and has minor damage. 

He’s a friendly enough guy is clearly quite shaken up. He’s going over the crash and I can hear he’s trying to weasel out of responsibility ie no recommended speed signs and it’s a dangerous road and it’s the best outcome given the situation and our car shouldn’t be on the road (given it’s a small hatchback and 2wd even though we managed to stay in our lane) and I’m staying calm just like ‘accidents happen’ kind of vibe given that we’re in his car in a remote place and don’t know him from a bar of soap. Anyway he offers to pay us half the excess out of being a Good Samaritan (I guess) and I’m kind of like I just want to get the fuck out of this car and have no disagreements so I’m being agreeable. To add to it I ask him to slow down three times when he’s going around corners and he also starts drifting around one of them accidentally and I’m like this guy can’t drive for shit or is dangerous. He drops us off at a motel (which he offered to pay for and didn’t) and we exchange licence. He’s told me he’ll contact me on Friday to arrange transfer for $2500 as he’ll be out of reception next couple of days. Finally, gf and I have parted way from guy and we’re both shaken and I feel like I should file a formal police report in the morning and the rental insurer can go after his insurer rather than me paying any excess for an accident I wasn’t at fault for. I’m worried it’ll drag out and that I should wear the 2.5k and claim part responsibility but I’m also concerned that gf’s whiplash could lead to needed Physio or treatment and that I could shoot myself in the foot here choosing not to open an investigation. Easy opt. I take 2.5k (that was only a handshake deal) and wear the other 2.5k OR other I file a police report, decline other drivers offer and accept no responsibility for crash. I have til the morning to decide because I need to contact the car rental. 

Btw I have all details of other drivers. Any help/advice would be so much appreciated.",zerofuksgibbon,3,1,0.67

828,Reported dead tree fell on rental property,118xjmr,"I rent a home in Florida from a property management company. A clearly dead large tree has been leaning toward the carport of this home since I moved in. I reported this tree (with pictures) to the property management company 9 months ago expressing a concern that it might fall because the lean had become more pronounced. They sent someone to look at it, but ultimately decided not to do anything about it. 

We’ll, the tree fell yesterday onto the carport. Luckily, no one was home, so no major damage to our vehicles. However, the tree also took out the utility lines connecting the house to to the grid. Electricians won’t come out until the tree is removed, which isn’t happening immediately. All of our food in the fridge is ruined and we’re having to eat out every meal, which is adding up. It’s been a major inconvenience for something that we reported 9 months ago. 

Property management is telling us to call our renters insurance, which has a $500 deductible that we will not meet. They’re also saying that it’s not their fault because a) they didn’t choose the type of policy we have b) it’s the homeowners responsibility to take care of trees and will not allow us to contact the homeowners (I suspect the property management company owns the home in some capacity). Truthfully I just want them to knock off a few hundred dollars off the rent for next month to help cover food costs, but they seem unwilling to deal at all and this feels like negligence to me since we reported it.

830,Family inheritance issues,118x9x9,"Hello! 

To keep a long story short, my mom was executor of her parents’ estate and after the second parent died, her sisters immediately sued her. This is New York State, USA. My grandparents didn’t have a will. 

Still in play are: (1) a condo her sister received prior to death, which the sister was supposed to pay out of inheritance. My mom hasn’t received her share of the payment. Nothing was put in writing for this. 

(2) a few tens of thousands in a shared account between my mom and dead grandpa, which her sisters want. They also want her to justify all expenses from the last year of his life. (3) There are also a few thousand left from the burial funds, which my mom has. 

My mom is definitely emotionally charged for these reasons (unrelated to succession): (1) she lived with my grandpa through co*id and her sisters didn’t help, despite being local (2) she opted out of the 10% executors fee (roughly $100,000) out of fairness to her sisters. She did this before my grandpa died. 

There are also bad feelings around the house, but it was ultimately sold and settled. 

My mom’s sisters continue to issue legal proceedings and harass her. For example, they’re now trying to nominate another sister as executor and have her resign. Grandpa has been dead 18 months and my mom settled the million dollar estate within a week, aside from the issues outlined above, so this is just silly. 

My question is: can you counter sue for harassment if people won’t stop bothering you with legal proceedings?

(Note: the money my mom has from the joint account roughly equals what her sister owes her for the first house, so IMO she should wash her hands, keep that money, and just never talk to her sisters again)

(Second note: the aunts suing my mom are racist and one of them once called my pregnant sister a c*nt. And also they drink and drive constantly. Just want everyone to have that context in case your first reaction was “preserve the family relationship.” I personally don’t think we should)

831,How does one respond to false allegations?,118x3b8,"My cousin’s ex(gf) is a known chronic alcohol abuser and all around mess of a human, yet she unfortunately has majority custody of their 5yr old daughter.   

Cousin is now pregnant with new his new wife-to-be, and now ex is lashing out in what seems to be a desperate attempt at total sabotage.   Not exactly my problem, as I’ve warned cousin about the mess he’s got to deal with.   However, crazy ex is now targeting my poor child with outrageous and patently false allegations.  

It would be laughable if it weren’t so serious.   She’s now brought their child into post-trauma therapy with all sorts of claims of inappropriate behavior due to the ‘influence of a certain family member’.   I don’t respond to this person.   Neither my child’s mother nor I have had any relationship with this person.   We’ve encountered each other many times over these short years, as the kids have gotten together for various gatherings, and she’s reeked of alcohol every single time.   

She’d always come off as super pleasant, and always very complimentary of our very well-behaved daughter, who’s very active and performing well in all areas of her life, and is quite accomplished for her young age.   (I’m very proud of my kid!)  it’s all very much out of left field, and the claims are comically implausible.   Her m.o. is completely transparent.   I feel so bad for my niece and my cousin!   

The mom has already admitted that she does not like their daughter, and has physically abused her, according to the dad.   Clearly, she is also sexualizing the child with suggestive and inappropriate concepts, for which she has no capacity to process, per latest allegations.   At 9, my kid is still very much enjoying her innocent years, and completely unaware of what’s going on.   She just doesn’t understand why she never gets to spend time with her cousin.

Kids should never be used as tools for the parents’ vengefulness.   Our kids should be enjoying their childhood together!  This whole situation is making me sick, as much as I’m trying to ignore the nonsense.   The allegations are enraging, but I’m not sure if I should even respond at all.   She just sent me & my child’s mom a threatening text with all sorts of outrageous claims, completely out of the blue, threatening to get the law involved.  She asserts blatant lies that are easily disproven.  I’ve seen this woman passed out drunk in her own puke at a kids bday party a couple years ago, for crying out loud.  She’s a total mess.  It’s absurd!  But she also has nothing to lose and is completely unhinged, and I’m very worried about how this will all play out.  Ive seen enough Dr. Phil shows to know that crazy, vengeful, alcoholic moms can be very dangerous!

834,Personal injury claim - will my assets be taken?,118wpvy,"After a car accident 4 years ago where I was at fault \[GA\], I collided with a girl on a bicycle. She had minor injuries but did require some surgery. My insurance contacted me some time ago to say that she has now thankfully fully recovered. They also informed me that there was a damages claim that would likely be above my $50,000 bodily injury limit.

I then didn't hear any more so I expected that her claim had settled within my policy limit. However my insurance called again recently and said that the claim had been delayed due to them continuing to try and agree a settlement within limit and that the girl was still just age 17 and if this could not be settled within policy limit and was to go through court she would need to involve a parent to do any suing. She has now reached age 18 so this is no longer an issue which I'm assuming that information is correct.

Unfortunately no settlement has been agreed and I was then served with court papers. She is suing me for $120k which is $70 above my policy limit, I have made my insurance aware and passed everything to them. My issue is that I do have some assets, I'm a guy age 58 and have some savings and investments for retirement. My insurance say that as they have not been able to agree a settlement in policy limits, my assets could be foreclosed on to pay for the amount she is suing me for above my limit.

I'm assuming that it is because of my assets that she is continuing suing me, so what I would like to know is if a court judgement is given on an amount anywhere near the $120k she is suing me for, will I be given any opportunity to set up an instalment payment plan or would my assets just be taken to pay in full?",Character-Worker1,2,0,0.33

My dad never paid child support when I was a kid. He kept claiming his social security counted for it, when it didn't and this isn't the first time we fought him on this. (I was a child the last time he was taken to court for this).

A couple of years ago, we (my mother and i) told our case worker about this, and she went ahead and tried to go after him for the child support he owed. We got one check in the mail, then it stopped. We then were informed he was taking us to court in Idaho, and we would be fighting a lawsuit.

The thing is, we weren't able to attend due to the fact we physically could not afford to go. It would require a plane ticket (or at least, way too much gas, which we all know is expensive) and would require a hotel, a lawyer, etc. All of which we just couldn't afford.

So we signed the document saying we couldn't go, and stated we also felt unsafe to go as my father has a tendency to be unstable.

837,What should I do (as a buyer)?,118wcdf,"Hi, this is my first post ever on reddit and I regret to say that it is a negative one.

Last month, I purchased an item off of eBay described as ""open-box"" condition. The seller further describes the item to show be very clean with very ""minimal"" signs of use. I contact him about this and told him that I am fine with a few light scratches, and he promised that it was very minimal.

Fast forward to when I received the item, I have come to discover that the item is FULL of scratches--far from what the seller claimed the product's condition to be in. It is in a totally different condition than the pictures he provided. I message him about this and he immediately accuses me of trying to ""game"" the system and purposefully damaging the product. He insulted me, said he would report me, and then stopped responding to any messages. Naturally, it was obvious he didn't want to accept my return.

So instead, I initiated a return through eBay INAD and waited a few days. Two days later, I was notified that the seller has accepted the return and I must return the item within a specified date to get my refund. I immediately tried to print the return label but kept getting an error. I decided to wait and contacted eBay CS the following day. They told me that the seller hasn't provided a shipping label yet so they will contact him for me. They also told me that if the seller fails to respond within a specified time frame, eBay will grant me a refund without requiring to return the item.

The thing is, this item is really expensive, and I would seriously hate to cheat the seller out of his money. However, to ship this with priority mail express (the only one I can use that doesn't take more than a week) costs about $100+ in shipping (I live outside the continental states). I am in a bit of a pickle as I feel really bad for the seller, but at the same time, this isn't something I'm willing to pay out of pocket for a seller who has insulted me and given me an extremely difficult time.

What do I do here? Keep the item and go about my life? Would eBay also refund the seller? Would the seller have any grey area to pursue me legally despite being advised by eBay to keep the item?",Dont-hate-Huskar,0,0,0.5

840,Entire paycheck garnished,118v8ag,"My employer is based in Virginia. I reside in Texas. 

The issue: I travel a lot for my job. Due to a company policy, I was not familiar with, my company card was revoked. There was a balance on the card no more than 8k. Mainly big ticket items like hotel stays , flights, car rentals. Expense reports must be made, submitted and approved by the company. I have expense reports submitted but they took 20+ days to be approved. 

My entire paycheck was garnished to go towards the card, without my knowledge, I only found out because I haven’t been paid. I, of course have bills to pay and a family relying on me. How can a company just take an entire paycheck without notifying the employee. Is that legal?

I emailed my branch manager directly to approve the reports, I should see the money in 2-3 business days.
I also emailed payroll, clarifying what the laws in both Texas and Virginia, in regards to deductions that are not court ordered. They have yet to get back to me.

841,"My STBX is selling off my/our property without my knowledge or permission, what can I do about it?",118uqvl,"(Throwaway because my partner stalks me online)

I’ll do my best to keep this as short as possible, but it covers a lot of years and a lot of my personal blood, sweat and tears, so it might be a bit long. 

My partner (50sM) and I (40sF) have been together for almost 9 years. He has lived with me almost the entire time in the house that I’ve owned for 21+ years that is in my name only. He brought nothing into the relationship other than a truck that has since been replaced with a much better one, a boat that went to the scrapyard due to its condition, and a couple bags of clothes that have been replaced as well. Our relationship is over, and I’m trying to get out of it with a little damage as possible, and he is making it impossible.

We both had good jobs in the beginning, but about a year and a half into our relationship, he got into some legal trouble, and we both lost our jobs as a result (mine was because I took off a lot of time - approved time off, not that that matters I suppose - but I wouldn’t tell the owner of the company what it was for and he was mad about that). All totaled, I spent around $20k getting him out of it all, and his probation is due to end this year. 

My partner and I both are very good at what we do, and we were able to combine our skills and start a business of our own that made us more than enough money to pay the bills and have whatever we needed. It was all legit - we had a Federal EIN, filed tax returns, registered with the state, had a business license, etc. - and the first few years were great. We helped a lot of people in the community that couldn’t afford the services of a bigger business and we worked very well together.

Somewhere along the way, though, something changed in our romantic relationship, and he was unable to separate our personal issues from our business obligations. I have no reservations about blaming the vast majority of our problems on him: he never tried to fix or even acknowledge the issues he brought into the relationship (issues that apparently were the cause of his marriage ending), and those same issues eventually ruined our own relationship. He would get mad at me for things he imagined in his head, most often it was that I was cheating (which I never did or even thought about doing), but also I was always lying or hiding things from him, etc. - things it turned out he was the one doing. When he would get mad, he would spend several days at a time in bed and refuse to do any work for the business. And even when he would finally get over it and get back to working, he would do things half-assed or just say something was done when it really wasn’t. I would do everything I possibly could to still keep things going, but eventually our customers got tired of being made to wait unreasonable amounts of time or paying for something that wasn’t right, and we lost them all. 

At that point, I was able to change our business model from servicing customers to just straight out selling products to anyone (ie instead of repairing widgets for people, we would buy broken widgets for cheap, repair them, and then sell them on the open marketplace to anyone). It was actually a much better and much more lucrative business, and again, we were able to make more than enough money to survive - until once again, he would use the issues from our personal relationship to dictate whether or not he was going to work on any given day. I am more than willing to admit that I made the mistake of thinking I could fix it if I tried hard enough and just had patience, and so instead of letting the business go and getting a job/another source of income like I should’ve, I just kept holding out hope that it would eventually turn around and we could get back to like it was when it started. That never happened.

We were able to make it through the pandemic with the help of the unemployment assistance for self-employed people that Congress authorized, but in that time I took out several loans to help us get by, and the balance on our business credit card kept getting hit with fees and interest when I couldn’t pay it on the set schedule (it was an Amex that gave you up to 60 days to repay the entire balance, and anything that wasn’t paid after that would accrue hideous amounts of interest from the date of purchase and exorbitant fees). After the unemployment ran out, things got even worse, and the loans and credit card were defaulted on, the companies eventually sued me and won (I was the guarantor on them even though they were in the business name), and so I now have several outstanding judgments against me to the tune of around $40k. As of today, my mortgage is four - almost five - months behind and most of the bills are past due. 

The business is dead, and our personal relationship has been over for quite some time. I have told him to leave more times than I can count over the last two years, packed his stuff up for him and loaded it in his truck, and, when none of that worked, I changed the locks three times - each time he would just bust the door open with a crowbar so that he could get in, then act like nothing happened and keep on like normal. He has destroyed other pieces of personal property of mine during some of our bigger fights and vandalized my car a few times as well. I have been reluctant to call the police up to this point because of him still being on probation -  I don’t want to see him go back to jail for that plus whatever else he would be charged with - but he just won’t leave.

Recently, I found out that he has been trying to sell the few assets we have left from the business on Facebook Marketplace without my knowledge. He will just load whatever up in his truck and meet the buyers off property, and I won’t even know something is gone until much later. From what I could see on his Facebook before he blocked me, he is/was selling these items for WAY below their value, and has made around $2500 in cash from what all he’s sold. 

One of the things he’s trying to sell right now happens to be broke down and sitting on the property of a friend of his and is too big/heavy for me to retrieve myself without paying someone with specialized equipment to move it (think: heavy equipment) a lot of money, which I obviously don’t have. The rest of the items are on my property, but they are things that I either bartered or paid cash for and I only have receipts (in my name) for a very few of them. I have the keys in my possession for the stuff that takes a key, but there is lots of other stuff that I would have no way to protect short of moving it to a storage facility somewhere (which, again, I can’t afford to do right now) - and most of it is very large and would require a lot of space.

I guess I have four questions I need some solid legal advice on to help get me out of this mess with as little damage as possible:

1.) How do I get him to leave my house for good? Do I have to file a legal eviction on him? Obviously he doesn’t have a lease or anything, but I know there are still rules as to how much time I have to give him to leave, etc.

2.) How do I stop him from selling anything else off without my permission? I don’t really care about the $2500 at this point, but I’d like to stop him from selling anything else unless we both agree to it and split the proceeds.

3.) How do I get possession of the item that is on his friend’s property? I do have a receipt/paperwork in my name for the item, but I’m unable to remove it from his property until I have the money to pay someone to do it. I do know how to get in contact with the friend, but I don’t know him personally/have never met him and I’m sure that he would likely react to any whiff of any potential legal involvement by just demanding that the item be removed from his property immediately. 

4.) How much of what is left do we each own? We are not married. I bought everything myself (mostly with money from the business though). It has been stored on my property. All of the debt we did accrue was either in my name or the business name with me as the guarantor (and the judgments we had on defaulted obligations are against me and only me). I will work out an agreement with him on what’s left if I have to (though I don’t expect that he would honor it), but honestly I feel like he has been living pretty much for free for many years now and whatever is left should go toward paying some of the debts and just basic living expenses that haven’t been paid - which only I would do, he would not.

Anything else that anyone can think of that I’m not seeing? I have been through a divorce before, but that was obviously more formal and straightforward. I’ve never been through a breakup with someone who was living with me. We are in GA and our business was an LLC with each of us listed as a 50/50 owner. I’d like to do everything as quietly as possible, as he is the type that if he found out I was making any moves to stop what he is doing, he would likely go full scorched earth and just take whatever he could and hide it, and destroy whatever he couldn’t. I’d like to prevent that if possible.

853,I got fired days after taking approved medical leave with no prior warnings?,118s2h4,"Not sure if this is the right place for this, I’d just like a bit more insight in my situation. 

I work remotely in Florida. My company was recently bought out by an international company, so my bosses changed. Around this time, I started experiencing medical issues, so that mixed with new procedures and hearing conflicting instructions from my two new bosses made my performance go down for about a week. 

I went to one of my bosses to apologize for my poor performance & communication for the past week and asked if I could take a medical leave. She said yes, but only if I could provide medical files. I’m pretty young and am ignorant when it comes to my rights, so I gathered those docs and asked HR where to send them. HR immediately said do not send them anywhere and that it would be a breach of my privacy. She told me to just make a calendar of the day/time of each upcoming appointment, which I did. I was approved for 2 weeks of leave. 

I was never reprimanded for my poor performance and communication the week leading up to my leave. I had been meeting all my quotas for months before that happened. 

Anyways, I come back from leave and for the first few days I am putting in extra work to try and catch up what I missed. Suddenly, everything is deactivated (slack and email) and I am not told why. I have to contact HR through a messaging platform that isn’t work related to ask what is going on. 

I was given a short pdf saying I was terminated for poor performance and lack of preparedness leading up to a medical leave. It also said in the letter that I am ineligible for unemployment and to not apply. When I asked follow up questions to HR they said to message my bosses and not them. The person from HR who terminated me isn’t the same one who approved the medical leave. 

They didn’t necessarily tell me to file for FMLA, and I didn’t need financial assistance, so I didn’t. But I have proof of disability and the countless appointments I had been attending while on leave. 

Today, a second girl was let go from my same department for fishy reasons. 

So I have a few questions: 
- could this be enough for wrongful termination? 
- was it illegal for my boss to ask for medical documents? 
- would I still be eligible for unemployment despite them saying otherwise?",cptemilie,5,0,0.4
854,[washington State] Employer paid me 6 weeks untaxed when the employment contract stated 2 weeks.,118rpq7,"I started this job a few months ago. When I first started, they told me there was a two week intro period where I’ll be an independent contractor and after the two weeks (if I do good enough) they’ll hire me on full time as an actual employee. Two weeks pass and they end up hiring me on full time. As a contractor, your pay doesn’t have taxes deducted from it and you have to pay that when you file your taxes. I prepared for what should have been one paychecks worth of taxes but once I got my 1099 I realized they paid me as a contractor for 6 weeks causing me to owe much more on my taxes. 

Both me and my employer signed the contract clearly stating the dates for contract work (2 weeks) and the full time employment agreement stating I’m a full time employee immediately after the contract period so I know they messed this up. This is also the case with everyone else who started around the same time as me. 
     I am going to talk to them about it but wanted to get some advice and info before I do so. I don’t necessarily want to start anything with them and I’m hoping they’ll realize their mistake and find a way to work with me, but it seems like they wanted to get out of paying employee taxes. I’m sick of employers thinking they don’t need to play by the rules and I’m worried they might not react well if I call them out on this. 
     Do I have anything here seeing as it seems they didn’t abide by our contract, or do I need to just shit up and pay the taxes? 6 weeks of pay may not seem like a lot but for a lower class American, owing over $1k in taxes fucks me over massively.

855,Invalid Lease?,118rgvu,"(In Mississippi). I’ll try to be as concise as I can. Me and two friends of mine moved into a house that was labeled as a “3 Bed, 3 Bath”. The lease labels this way as well (important).
After some generally slow work on very necessary maintenance requests we made, one of my roommates was complaining to his mom and made a comment about how his room is “odd” as it is in the center of the home, has no windows, and only one exit/entrance. His mom, being concerned about this, called our local code enforcement, who inspected and confirmed that this was not legal as it is a huge fire safety issue. This occurred 2/15/23. 
He told our property manager that “this lease cannot be valid if it was signed as a 3 Bed, Bath”. Very quickly we started looking into other rentals as he is not allowed to stay in his room. We were able to find one, but there was only availability immediately. So, with not a lot of time to waste, we signed another lease under the idea that ours was no longer valid (or never was). We’re supposed start our new lease on 2/23/23. 
Today I talked with my property manager who stated that he had only received a code “warning” of sorts, that they would be “fixing the issue”, and the lease was still valid so long as they did so. Additionally, he stated that the homeowner would still require us to give a 30 days notice, as “our lease” requires. 
This would mean that we will be paying rent for the remainder of the month at our new apartment, and then March rent for both places in the 1st. 
I looked up the code myself, and it states: “a. All resident bedrooms shall have an outside exposure and shall not be below grade.”
Source: https://casetext.com/regulation/mississippi-administrative-code/title-15-mississippi-department-of-health/part-16-health-facilities/subpart-1-health-facilities-licensure-and-certification/chapter-48-minimum-standards-for-personal-care-homes-residential/subchapter-18-physical-environment/rule-15-16-1-48182-bedrooms
Due to the placement of his room in the center of the house, it is physically impossible to “fix” this issue, as there is no possible way to make an “outside exposure”. 
As such, shouldn’t the lease be invalid? And can we not simply leave due to the code violation directly preventing the lease conditions in question (3 Bed, 3 Bath) from being possible?",SGM-Heide,0,2,1.0

* From Sept. 2021 to Sept 2022, I was on a lease paying $1230/month
* When that lease expired in Sept 2022, I converted to month-to-month, paying $1354/month (9.9% increase, the legal max for 2022).
* I recently received notice from my landlord that my rent is going up at the beginning of March to either $1393 (2.9% increase vs. my current rent, 13.3% vs. my rent 12 months ago) if I sign a new lease, or $1408 (3.9% increase vs. my current rent, 14.5% vs. my rent 12 months ago) if I stay on month-to-month.

My question - is the recent rent increase legal? On one hand, the upcoming rent increase will be under the 2023 cap, even vs. my rent 12 months ago.

When I (23) was a kid my dad repeatedly sexually assaulted me. We lived in Virginia, US when it happened and I was around the ages of 9-11. My memory of my childhood is not very good so I'm not sure exactly when it started and stopped. He was also very neglectful and I believe physically abusive (I know that he hit my brother but I'm unsure if he ever hit me, like I said my memory of my childhood is very bad). 

For a long time I didn't really want to do anything about it. I was kind of in my head that when I graduated college I was going to cut ties from my family and never talk to anyone again. But I am still very much financially dependent on him. He is fairly well off. He gives my mom some money monthly for my student loans, which is a lot less than half. He had previously said he would cover the full amount until I got on my feet. But when I got a job at a convenience store he got upset about still having to pay. I had to stop working because the job was too physically demanding but I have not told him. This payment is also supposed to cover my brothers payments (he's still in school so they payment is significantly less), but my brother recently stopped talking to him (he has the right idea) and so he's refusing to help with my brothers. My health insurance (which is very nice) pays for (most of) my biweekly therapy appointments, psychiatry, physical therapy, and medication is through my step mom (and kinda by extension him). (Side note I do not think my step mom knows and I do not know if I should tell her). He also occasionally gives me money for bill if I need ask, but it's always very awkward and stressful for me.

I want to cut contact with my dad because plainly put he's awful. But I can't really do that with the financial support he's giving me. I don't think I want to press criminal charges, but I want to know if it would be possible for me to get enough money from a lawsuit or private settlement (do not know if I am using the right terms) that I could support myself without him until I get on my feet.

864,Intestate Inheritance in Indiana?,118qsdi,"Context: My father just passed suddenly and unexpectedly and has no will. So, his estate (small) will be divided per Indiana’s Intestacy Laws. He has no spouse, I am his daughter born in wedlock, and he has a son significantly older than me that was born out of wedlock. If these were the only details, per law, we are each entitled to half of his estate, and I would be 100% okay with that.

Here is where it gets complicated: my father talked to me and others extensively about how he could not get in contact with my half-brother, even after contacting my half-brother’s birth mother. There was speculation between them about whether my brother had developed an opiate addiction. In the past, my father had maintained a relationship with my brother, but for the past decade, despite my fathers best efforts, my brother has showed no effort in kind. 

Here is my question: how likely is it that my brother would still be entitled to inherit half of my father’s small estate (< 50K)? And is this something I can contest in probate court?

Any and all info and advice would be greatly appreciated - thank you so much in advance.

Important detail: I have always wanted a relationship with my brother, but it broke my and my late father’s heart that he had no interest in us. Being as he may have developed an opiate addiction though, it feels unfair that he would inherit half of my father’s small estate, especially because at 24 I have to handle the affairs of my father’s passing by myself.

I have no idea what I’m doing or how to handle this, and obviously have clouded judgement and some hard feelings. I would very much appreciate arguments for both sides. Part of me believes it is the right thing to split the small estate with him. The other part has to endure the burden of this task alone and is pissed that someone who had no interest in or love for my father would be entitled to what little I am left with after I pay his massive medical bills from his estate.",justtimingthepast,4,0,0.5

866,HELP! I think my student loan debt was wrongfully sent to collections!,118qpky,"(Relevant states provided in text below)

I started taking classes through Capella University online in May of 2020. I lived in New Jersey at the time. I had a series of physical and mental health issues that doctors were having a difficult time diagnosing. It ultimately resulted in me leaving Capella in November of 2020. It was in the middle of a semester. I spoke with their finance office prior to making the decision to drop out, and they assured me that because it was a medical emergency, I would not have to pay for the semester. Unfortunately, I do not have that writing as I trusted they had my best interests at heart. However, shortly after that, when I made the official decision to drop out with this information in mind, I was then notified that I would be required to pay the semester outright immediately. I reached out and explained what I was told, and they claimed to have no record of the original advice. I then noted that I had no income and would be unable to pay. They then told me that I would be able to pay in increments, monthly, through a third party known as Williams & Fudge. The total amount owed was stated to be $5010.00. I set up a direct deposit autopayment plan with Williams & Fudge, where they automatically charged me $100 a month. I paid automatically, on time, every month, from January 19th, 2021, to July 18th, 2022. The remaining amount due at that point was $3210.00. All correspondence with Williams & Fudge up until this point had been through email. In June of 2022, I moved to Tennessee. July 18th, 2022, was the last time Williams & Fudge reached out to me in any way to notify me that my latest payment was accepted (bringing the total remaining to $3210.00). After that point, they ceased all communication with me and stopped charging me. No card, bank account, or email information had changed. I later checked my credit score via Credit Karma at the beginning of December, as I do so every once in a while, to find that there was a significant decrease in my credit score. I immediately check what had changed, only to find a collection had been reported against my credit several months prior on September 19th, 2022. The collections agency is General Revenue Corp. It says that the original creditor is Capella University, not Williams & Fudge. The amount owed is the remaining $3210.00. I still, to this day, have not been contacted. When noticed the collection on my credit report, I immediately disputed the claim through Credit Karma on December 11th, 2022. I had been checking for updates for the dispute periodically. On February 14th, 2023, I received an email from Credit Karma stating that the dispute had been resolved on February 7th, 2023. The dispute result stated, ""TransUnion investigated the dispute, but the information was verified as accurate."" I just saw this today (February 21st, 2023). I am still in Tennessee. At the time of writing this, I have received no notification from, nor have I been contacted in any way by Capella University, Williams & Fudge, or General Revenue Corp.

I don't know what to do. I don't have this kind of money, hence the reason I was making payments monthly. I don't know why they stopped charging me and never reached out. I don't know why it went to collections. This has heavily impacted my credit score. I just need help. I am confused, my health issues have not been resolved, and I am still unemployed. My spouse makes enough for us to get by, but our budget is already tight, and we can't afford this. Is there anything we can do? Do we wait to be contacted? Do we contact any of the parties involved?

Any advice is appreciated. This is stressful.

871,Estate/Trust Advice,118qjtm,"My friend’s grandfather just passed away. He had a land trust and an account with a significant amount of money in it. He had trouble remembering things and forgetting to eat and take his meds. He had dementia and was diagnosed in 2017. Her cousin was the POA over him during 2016, he was unable because she was not 18 at the time. During the time of POA her cousin changed the trust, something that had not been changed since 1997 and there was no beneficiary listed, in 2016 his name was added as the beneficiary. They also did the same for one of his accounts. (Mind you her grandfather was not able to take care of himself nor make decisions) In 2017, the cousins took her grandfather to his check up and they declared him incompetent 6-7 months after they changed the land trust and the account to their names as beneficiaries and got emergency guardianship over him and conveniently when my friend tried to get a lawyer to look into his estate because there were some red flags on financial abuse. After the guardianship it was said there was nothing she could do.

After meeting with a lawyer after he was deceased. The first account should have gone to her, but then her cousin said he was the beneficiary and he gets that account. It was found that he had a second account that had over 200k in 2017 and around 150k in 2019-2020 and was dwindled down to 30k in 2022. Then to top it off, they were the beneficiaries of the 50+ acre farm, her grandfather owned on a trust that hadn’t changed in 17 years until he got sick. 

My friend was in charge of the estate, and got what debt her grandfather had, taxes, and an estate account that will be dwindled down more after the estate is closed. 

Due to them taking the role of caretakers I get they should be paid but I feel something is wrong with this situation or something is off. I would assume the granddaughter would be the next of kin, due to her father passing and no other next of kin. 

My friend doesn’t have enough money to hire an attorney and she is afraid if she tries to fight it she will lose. The lawyer who is handling the estate said there is nothing she can do.

874,Repair and Deduct - Release Necessary?,118q9xm,"I’ll try to be brief — a fire broke out in my apartment due to an electric oven with faulty wiring. The apartment needed smoke remediation, new paint (with a special primer), new oven, etc… It took the property manager too long to get someone for repairs (ceiling damage/new sheetrock and smoke remediation/new paint job). When he did get someone to contact me they never showed up on the agreed date, and probably for the better as a man in a van was not what was needed. (Also, renters insurance doesn’t cover soot removal, new paint, and apartment wall repairs). 
 
After 3+ weeks of no action from the property manager I bought the materials myself, kept all the receipts, and advised the property manager I would deduct it from the rent. He said he would prefer to cut a check. 
 
I repaired the sheet rock ceiling, I removed the soot from the ceiling and walls, I primed the whole place with special primer, repainted the walls with finish paint, and will finish cleaning soon. I informed the property manager I would deduct only the material costs from the rent. The property manager wants me to sign a release indemnifying them of all claims in order to do so (and wants me to get it notarized) and then he’s agree to deducting the cost from the rent. 
 
I’m pretty sure I don’t need to sign anything to repair and deduct in NY, let alone a rent stabilized apartment. 
 
The release is vague and has no mention of dates or incidents, it just says “anything to this date” pretty much. 
 
Can someone confirm if a release is a prerequisite in this instance? Do I have right of refusal or can I still state I don’t waive my claim of residual damages for any reason? Is this property manager actually worried they screwed the pooch on how this was handled? 

Additional notes: Half the apartment was unusable for the first 3 weeks (kitchen burnt up, everything moved around for cleaning), took 3 weeks to get a new stove, I’ve been at my fathers for the last 3 weeks, fire happened on 1/8, painting started 1/29, should be done and moved back in this weekend.

882,Decided not to press charges,118pp46,"I was sexually assaulted last year by a man I met online. I reported the incident the night it happened, completed the kit at the hospital, and submitted it to the police. However, I did not get a chance to have a formal statement done. There were a lot of miscommunication between me and the detective handling the case. Mostly because of scheduling conflicts.

After almost a year of trying to meet with the detective for a statement to be filed, I decided that I no longer want to do it.

Initially, I wanted to press charges because I knew 1) I was violated 2) The perpetrator should be held responsible for his actions 3) I don’t want other women to go through the same situation.

But after the long wait, the legal consults, and multiple failed attempts of reaching out to the detective, I realized that in the end, whatever happens, I would still suffer. I would have to bear the burden of going through the legal process, the shame, fear, guilt. 

I was told by a legal advisor that the case is not about me against the perpetrator. It is the state vs. him. I should be aware that I am only a witness to the case. The message I am getting here is “it’s purely business, nothing personal”. I was told that the detective is not required to inform me of the case progress or updates as it is considered evidence and informing me of everything could compromise the case.

However, there is no case until there’s been a formal statement conducted. 

Part of me feels like the world is sending me a message and that I shouldn’t proceed with it because whatever I do, no matter how many attempts I make to provide a statement, the detective would always cancel on me. Perhaps the detective knows that this case does not have enough grounds? I truly don’t know. 

Has anyone ever had an experience with detectives constantly canceling on you? Would this action mean something or could it be purely coincidental?

885,"Can my employer completely change my job description, adding pages of new duties, without my approval and without additional pay? I'm an underpaid college staff member being used as ""faculty"" for teaching their courses...",118pluh,"Hi! I would really appreciate any advice here. I'm having a dispute with my employer, a private university in Colorado, and unsure how to proceed. The essential problem is that my employer is using me, a staff member, as an underpaid & unofficial faculty member teaching university courses. I'm a non-exempt salary employee, fyi. I'm wondering if I should talk to an attorney, or let it go. or quit.

My questions are this:

1. Can my employer use me as ""instructor"" for university level courses without compensating me as a faculty member? #longtermproblem
2. Can my employer completely change my job description, adding pages of new duties last week, without my approval and without additional compensation? #shorttermproblem

A brief background... I was hired in 2019 as the technical director of the music department at a private university in Colorado. I was hired at the very bottom of my salary band because I only had a bachelors degree. All faculty here have masters/PhD. However I did have the background in audio and music. My essential job duties were much more staff/support oriented: audio record music department concerts, manage the recording studios and record student + faculty sessions, repair & purchase equipment, and... now infamously...  (1 single line in my job description) assist music technology faculty with courses. Ha!

Fast forward to 2023 - I'm listed as ""instructor"" on the syllabus for 5 music technology classes per year - ""blocks"" - per year. Officially I ""co-teach"" with a PhD of Music Tech. I'm planning these courses, creating assignments, many video tutorials, leading class sessions by myself, giving student feedback on their assignments, hosting office hours, mentoring them privately, etc, etc. I've taken on many, many, many new job duties without pay (trying to impress, obviously) and have made less than 1% raise over the past 4 years ($50k to $53k, despite getting the highest possible annual reviews every year). I brought this to the attention of my department chair in December and said I'm doing far more than what I was hired for and my salary has barely increased. I'm driving 1hr15mins to campus, gas $$ going way up, etc. He recommended we begin revamping my job description to include all the teaching, videography and video production, live-streaming our events and a whole slate of things I was never hired to do - in order for the college administration to ""reclassify"" my job and increase my pay. I believe my boss was genuinely trying to help me and I will post the new job description below for those curious.

Here's the shady part. After submitting this revised, beefed up job description with pages of new duties to our HR department on campus - they \*accepted\* the job description that my boss and I wrote up, and its now officially my new job (still the same title, Technical Director, with many more duties)... However, HR claimed it did not warrant any additional compensation. So I basically gave myself a bunch of new work for no pay. Why? I was honestly shocked. How can they do that?

I think it's extremely unfair our HR accepted the new job description without offering any additional pay. If anything they should've said - we can't pay you more, so you should keep your old job. It was a totally one sided negotiation, or ""do-over"" for them. I never agreed to those new terms and duties without more pay. However, it's official now, and my department chair (who feels terrible about this, agreed it was shady, and for the record, and told me today he wouldn't be surprised if I told him to fuck off and then quit) said there's essentially nothing we can do now.

I'm really torn about this because I love my job, I love the work I do, and I love my students. I have great relationships with the faculty and my department chair too.  I just want to be paid fairly and not exploited as a staff member when I'm like ""unofficial"" faculty. I also live about 1hr. 15 from campus and its a huge commute for me to make only $53K per year. I'm also a single dad, and thus a single income household with my kiddo.

Should I talk to an employment attorney about this? Is there any \*there\* there?

Or is this just the way academia works?

""Payroll will automatically be deposited every Tuesday during business banking hours for the previous week worked.""

893,Someone i know is a registered sex offender and is online.,118p1d5,"Hello, Reddit! Sorry for the vagueness, as anonymity is very important in this situation. All people involved live in the United States. I would prefer not to specify which state but if that information is needed in order to answer accurately I can provide the state that the person in question lives in.

I have a family member who’s partner is a registered sex offender. I was fed a story that made it seem like they were innocent, but there were some plot holes i hadn’t thought about at the time. Recently this person directed some predatory behavior in my direction through social media that was nothing short of traumatizing. This event has made me rethink everything I had been told about this person and i no longer believe their story is accurate and i fear that this person will use their online presence to cause issues for other people as well.

I want to report this person to their parole officer since part of their parole says they are not permitted to be online. I have proof of the incident, pictures of my phone with most of the messages from said person. If I report this person to the parole officer and supply the proof will it be completely anonymous? Will they see the proof I supplied, or will they straight up tell the person who did it or any identifying details? 

I have a hobby that I hope to turn into a career one day that relies on being anonymous, and I sadly trusted them and let them know about this hobby. They both have my information for it and I have concerns that they will attempt to leak my personal info if they find out my plans or if the parol officer tells them who did it or shows the identifying proof. 

Additionally, I have a therapy appointment set up in the future that I made specifically because of this initial harassment from them. If i waited and told my therapist about it, I think she would have to report it since said person is on parol and is breaking the law in a way that harms others. Is this a valid option?

895,"DHS HSI(Homeland Security Investigations) refuse to investigate my human trafficking case due to implicit ""Statute of Limitation"", how can I convince them to investigate?",118p04e,"I am a survivor of human trafficking and immigration fraud when I was a minor. Recently I reported my case to the DHS HSI. After I submitted my initial summary and some evidence to an HSI agent, a couple of weeks later he told me HSI won't investigate my case due to the ""statute of limitation"" but without explaining that part in detail. However, my case involved harboring and smuggling which is subject to a ten-year statute of limitations and my case falls into that timeframe. (Please refer to (D. Statute of Limitations) to this link on P.23 [https://nationalimmigrationproject.org/PDFs/practitioners/practice\_advisories/pr/2017\_28Sep\_memo-1324a.pdf](https://nationalimmigrationproject.org/PDFs/practitioners/practice_advisories/pr/2017_28Sep_memo-1324a.pdf))

&#x200B;

The response from DHS HSI is a bit bureaucratic and they aren't allowed to share what's the exact reason due to the confidentiality of internal communication. I just feel like because my case isn't any high profile or severe case like the Jefferey Epstein case, and also HSI is under resource constraint so my case can't satisfy the threshold of internal policy for prosecution rather than a statute of limitations. DHS is one of the most powerful federal agencies in the country so I am in no position to challenge them and the best thing I can do is to convince them. Personally, I just can't sit here and let those criminals keep flying under the radar and keep exploiting children as I am not the only victim as far as I am concerned.

I am disappointed and devastated by the ""no actions"" response from HSI. How can I convince HSI my case is prosecutable and launch an investigation of my case? Can I get to a prosecutor or any lawyers that have experience as a prosecutor to sort out this situation with HSI?

If anyone has experience dealing with or working within any federal law enforcement agencies, do you think I should approach other agencies like USCIS or ICE as well to see if they will handle things differently?

901,Can my mothers ex boyfriend from 30 years ago take away my inheritance?,118o7l0,"My mother, back around 1992ish, decided to take out a mortgage in both her name and her ex’s name on the home I grew up in. Their relationship ended about a year after they purchased the home, and he basically disappeared and has been out of contact with her for the last 30 years.

The whole time though, she has been making payments personally for this home all by herself to the local credit union. Her ex hasn’t made a single payment or paid any taxes on the property.

When she got to the very last payment, she told me the credit union informed her that her ex had come and closed the account and got all the closing paperwork for the property (idk what that all means, but I assume it’s not good).

So my question is, if something were to happen to my mom… like if she died tomorrow… is her ex within his rights to just swoop in after 30 years of NOTHING and just claim ownership of her house? Or do I have any say in the matter? 

This has been bothering me for years, and she refuses to speak to a lawyer about it because of “how expensive it would be.”

There’s a line that clearly states “the combined value of the 3 gifts is to be divided equally between the 3 grandchildren” and I had a lawyer already clearly determine that it means 10% of that stock + $50k total is to be split equally amongst the 3 of us. The will states that the company’s own accountant is to determine the value of the company, thus determining the value of the 10%.

We already paid rent for 4 weeks just before it, signed a lease but they feel like they don’t owe us anything due to them wording their lease with weird terms to make it seem like we weren’t paying rent, saying on the lease that we were paying for “inconvenience fees”, not rent and that they “are not our landlords” on the lease we signed and are supposedly also able to “kick us out for any reason at any time”, which seems illegal. We ended up staying in a hotel for two weeks after before we found a place. I feel like this is an illegal self-help eviction from a lawyer friends point of view, but not sure myself.

914,Is my friend legally on the hook for thousands of dollars of 'debt'?,118nc01,"I apologize if this isn't the right sub, I'm doing my best to help and will probably cross-post.  My friend 'Paula' is a domestic violence survivor.  She finally escaped from that awful situation with pretty much nothing to her name.  Managed to get a starter job and a really sketchy starter place.  Probably a year and a half later she got in a new relationship, and like many people the pandemic ended up encouraging them to move in together sooner than they probably should have.  He had his own place (with mortgage), multiple sources of income, and kids.  There were definitely some red flags in the relationship, but her situation was improved enough that she overlooked a lot.  

Now the finances- when Paula moved in with him he told her she'd contribute to half the mortgage, which she agreed to.  She also hadn't built up credit yet, so he made some larger purchases for her (a laptop for work, etc) with the expectation that she'd pay him back.  Unfortunately (hello pandemic again) Paula lost her job and was unemployed for several months.  During this time BF tallied up what she owed him, based on their 'half the mortgage per month' deal, and added it to her total debt to him.  BF has recently decided commitment is not for him, and broken up with Paula, however he 'expects' her to continue living with him, paying half the mortgage, and repay her 'debt' to him.

Possibly important details:

* There was no written contract for any of this.
* The amount owed is approximately 10k.
* Over half of her current paycheck is going to his mortgage, making her moving out very difficult.  She feels trapped and panicked. 
* While she was unemployed she provided care for his children, who he removed from daycare for her to do so.  They went back to daycare once she found a new job.
* Some of the red flags include him trying to buy additional property with the money she was contributing, while not allowing her name anywhere on the documents, etc. The money was supposed to be to help with the mortgage, but he seems to be treating her as an additional source of income.

My concern is Paula may be being financially abused.  It's one thing to pay back a laptop, but it seems super shitty to total up thousands in debt for your romantic partner when you don't even need the income, then use that to keep her stuck there and handing you cash.  I do realize this is not r/relationships, I'm just looking for her legal obligations, what might she actually owe vs what can she walk away from, and if she does walk, what should she be prepared for if he takes her to court?

I came out of my small town's casino to find my car had been dented on both driver-side doors. Luckily a friend of mine was already in the car when the accident happened. Apparently a girl I know who has no license was driving some well-to-do guy's nice truck while he sat as passenger. 
After hitting my car the girl got out and told my passenger that they would come see me at my house but wanted to leave before cops were involved. 
They never showed. Eventually I was able to get contact info for the driver and tried messaging him several times with no response. I even got an estimate and asked if he could pay half and still no response.
My question is, who is responsible? The guy who the truck belongs to or the unlicensed and uninsured driver who he let behind the wheel? I've heard back that the guy has received all of my texts but just chooses to ignore them claiming that it's the driver's fault.

They had been divorced for 10+ years. A criminal case was opened, and eventually my brother was offered a plea deal, as the initial allegations never held up in court. There was no evidence and the investigation done with the child did not line up with the original allegations.

My brother took a plea deal where he was on probation for 10 years, had to register as a sex offender, couldn’t be around minors, lost custody of his children, but the plea deal he took stated he was watching child pornographry. Completely different from the initial charges. My brother was essentially living a life on house arrest and the depression and loneliness overcame him.

He took his own life on November 28th, 2021. He has a will that lists me as the executor and has specific wishes written out.

The courts somehow granted the ex to be the executor of the estate. The judge said the videos won’t hold up which I can understand, but why would my rights as the executor be taken away?

I accept that, took the vehicle and send to the wrap shop to protect it with PPF film.

Few months later Tesla called and said that the Bodyshop could take the vehicle to fix the issues in the trunk, inside the door trim, and a small paint contamination.

This service took 4 months, the Bodyshop cracked the driver window glass, left the vehicle at the desert sun for months in the summer without the glass, damaged another panel, the vehicle camera, front, and rear bumpers.

Before delivery they fixed the glass, put a new camera that was defective, applied PPF to two of the 4 damaged panels and returned the car.

When inspecting the car we though the damage in the remaining front and rear bumpers were to the PPF, therefore it would only need to be replaced. When the PPF company evaluated it, they said that the damage was deep to inside the bumpers plastic and needs replacement.

Tesla keeps saying that they don’t fix PPF. And they agreed to replace the bumpers, but they don’t want to be accountable to the PPF.

To keep this short on all the damage they did I’ll focus on that, because there is more but Tesla is fixing the others. But I can’t get them to return me the car the way they got.

Is there a legal way I can enforce Tesla to return the vehicle without damages and with the PPF that it had when they got it.

The issue here is Cardiologist's U-turn at the last week. Obviously, it is unjust for doctors to backpedal like this! Cardiologist slyly misrepresented her capacity, and confirmed my appointment even though she overbooked! Cardiologist should have refused Patient's referral back in December 2022. Patient took time off work for this appointment.

951,International Freight Theft?,118lpg2,"I'm not sure if this actually qualifies as theft or anything, I just couldn't think of a better word. It may be, it's certainly sounding scammy, but never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity so who knows. It may be some other crime besides theft, or it may not be a crime at all, which is part of what I'm trying to figure out here. The situation is a little complicated but I'll do my best to describe it here.

Location: near Los Angela's California (currently.) Though this involves international freight. Freight sent from China to the US, currently in (supposedly) California.

My wife works for a company that exports equipment from China to other countries. We both currently live in China, but I am an American citizen if it matters at all, though I doubt it would because I don't work for her company. A customer ordered a piece of machinery, worth roughly $5000 USD. It is a very large piece of equipment, though I don't have the weight on hand right now. The customer didn't have the budget for a shipper like FedEx and so another shipper was used, they're not one of the big names like UPS or anything. They were at least at some point a real shipping company that successfully delivered packages but I think they might be tight on money now, after our last COVID lockdown situation.  

An agreement was made for an expected shipping time, and of course that can vary but, the freight left China with them and arrived at their warehouse in California. And then after that it just didn't move. A month went by and they hadn't done anything. We are still in contact with them but it's not very useful contact. But at that point it's just cheap shipper being bad. Another month goes by.

Eventually, after a bunch of this, just to get the freight to the customer it was decided to take the profit from this and just use that to hand the package over to FedEx Freight, making no profit ends up cheaper than having the package in America with no one to sell it to. The shipping company agreed to this eventually. They gave us the location of their warehouse and a phone number. I don't think the phone number is real, but maybe they're just garbage, because no one ever picks up. Their side in China assured us the package was ready and so we arranged for FedEx to go pick up the freight. FedEx goes and they're unable to get the package, likely because they couldn't contact anybody or when they showed up there was no one to get it from (""Freight is not ready"" from fedex, which can mean a few things.) So we talk to them again and arrange another pickup, FedEx is again unable to get the package from them for the handover. It seems like they're keeping the package and there's no way for anyone to get it.

On the Chinese side this is long enough that at least it's breach of contract but that would be a whole process.
On the American side though, I don't know, at what point do we say they've stolen the package? Is there even a point where that's the case? And if so, where do we go from here? Is there any particular agency we file a report with in California? Is it a federal issue as it's an International package? Are there any particular laws about things like this? I tried to look up stuff about freight theft and most of it seems to be with the California Highway Patrol and literal theft of trucks containing freight which doesn't seem entirely relevant.

I have my suspicions they've either lost the package or are just stealing it but who knows they may just be insanely incompetent.

I want to know what I’m talking about before I have a meeting with general manager and seek out a lawyer. 

This last pay period, many of the staff at my restaurant lost 50-75% of our checks due to estimated cash tips that our employer claimed we made. A blast to all employees from management was sent the night before payroll was due saying that we are responsible to report all cash tips and that our online w2’s are available. When we got our checks this pay period, many of us noticed the significant pay cut and asked our cash manager what was going on and we were directed to our general manager. All managers have been informed to not answer any questions regarding this and redirect us to the general manager. 

I know of someone who who lost 75% of their pay and their remaining paycheck didn’t even equate to their hourly. I know of another employee who reports all of their cash tips every shift and they were still taxed on a higher amount than reported. When they asked how our employer was going to rectify the loss in pay, our employer responded that they would be taxed less next pay period. 

Personally, I report my cash tips at the end of the tax year when I file. I’m wondering if it is legal to tax us on cash tips we haven’t declared. They are also taxing us on the assumption that we made 20% on every check closed to cash. We tip out the restaurant with our cash out every night 5.5% of our sales regardless of tip percentage. We also tip out out food runners/bussers 1-2% of our sales in cash every night. In total we lose about 7-8% of our tips already at the end of every shift which was fine with me until now. Now, we lose this money on top of paying a tax on cash tips they assumed we made but probably didn’t even make. We also signed paper work when beginning employment to not unionize so we want to be careful.",Superb-Work5044,0,1,1.0

I feel awful for my customers when I hear ""well the salesman said"" or ""but I still have a power bill"" or the rare but hardest hitting ""I'm paying more than before"" when I visit their systems to do health checks or repairs.

I visit many different customers with many different systems that went through many different companies. Some of them were sold on blatant lies, but most simply got told a 'convenient truth'. Since then, the utility companies that said they would do net metering have rug-pulled like crazy. This means customers are now stuck in what is effectively a second mortgage.

We did not catch this and neither did the dealership we agreed on a trade plus $13,000 for a Chevy blazer with a branded title.

I state all that because now the dealership has found the issue and is trying to demand another $8500 in order to keep the car.

970,I think there's fraudulent activity under my name from the car dealership,118kq31,"Several months ago we decided to put an order for a new SUV. When the vehicle came in we went to negotiate the price and we couldn't come to terms so we decided to walk out on the car. Fast forward a couple months and I started to receive toll tag bills for that vehicle. Come to find out that the dealership printed a temporary tag under my name but used it when they sold the car to another person and I was receiving all of the bills for their tolls. When I told the dealership they were willing to pay the tolls. 

Now I have found out that the tag is running tolls beyond its expiration date even though the dealership assured me that they asked that person to come in and change their tags. On top of that the tolls are running in a different city and the toll company cannot confirm its the same car. So I'm not too sure if I can believe that they actually changed the tags or if someone has taken a picture of the tag and is still using it. 

My question is if I never signed any paperwork for the vehicle how can the dealership have tags that are registered to the state under my name. The car salesman had the tags ready to go before I even got to the dealership. My suspicion is that since the tags were printed well before I even arrived to negotiate the car that the dealership fraudulently signed for the registration with the state.

972,Colorado- TRO denied,118kpkh,"A friend of mine finally after a year took the advice of literally everyone and separated from her abuser. Not going to fault her for taking over a year to realize we weren't just saying to drop the guy because we didn't like him. Or the fact that what finally got her to wake up was he crossed the line into physical abuse.

The issue here is after he punched her 6yo daughter for having the audacity to put a napkin over a single chicken nugget because she was full she woke up and realized she needed to get out. She went through a local DV support organization and did everything they suggested- filed for sole custody of their 2mo old (whose name the abuser has never even said and simply refers to her as ""the baby"" all the time), and filed for a Temporary Restraining Order.

We are trying to figure out additional options because the asshole judge refused to issue the TRO on his opinion it was ""a civil matter the courts shouldn't interfere in"" and has the potential to harm his career (he's a pharmacy technician at Walmart). 

The first thing this guy did after she left was spend roughly $500 to cover their apartment with wifi security cameras. As soon as she went back while he was at work (her name is on the lease) he started talking to her through the entertainment system speakers and demanding she leaves certain things behind, including items that were purchased by and left to her when he first husband passed, though he stopped that as soon as he realized I was there (I was outside in the hall when she first went in), and then promptly freaked out and started shouting when I started disconnecting the TV and game systems. Only to rush home and demand she hook up the router (that again she owns) because he didn't trust anyone and demanded to know where ""the baby"" was- again couldn't even say his own daughters name.

I could see the damage on the walls where someone had literally punched it hard enough to break the drywall, and while today was the first time he's acted aggressive around me, several others have seen him start screaming for things like the baby being too loud, insist on holding onto her medications but refuse to give them to her when needed, etc.

Their lease was up on january 1 and they stayed until January 11th. So technically I can charge them double rent. Writ of termination was awarded for $3700 (November and December plus late fees). However, when I finally gained entry to the house of course it was trashed. Had to replace carpet, fix about 5 holes, paint, new garbage disposal, new microwave, new doors, refrigerator, etc. I paid about 5k in repairs. 

Honestly, I would work with them if they would just tell me they were having a hard time.

They finish, pull it out of the bay, I hop in, accelerate a few feet and notice that there's a flashing/beeping red oil light and the car is making a rattling noise. So I take it back around, they take another look, change the oil, replace the filter, etc. The problem is still there, and the manager was especially apologetic and even called his district manager to see what else they could do. The DM said that he'd come take a look himself and fix it free of charge. The manager of this store offered me a ride home, and I turned it down because I only lived like a mile away.

The manager called me back and said that the DM came and replaced the oil pressure sensors and figured that it must be the oil pump that got broken yesterday. Then the manager said that I'd have to take it to the full service Jiffy Lube and pay to have it replaced. I was a little confused but went to his store to get my keys and talk with him about it. This is when he completely flipped the script with me. He reiterated that I'd have to pay for it because the ""liability was no longer with us"" and that it was an ""incredible coincidence"". I told him no, it wasn't, my car was working fine before I came in and as soon as I got behind the wheel again it wasn't. He said something like ""well, we can prove it was a coincidence and you can't prove it was us."" I didn't take that for an answer so he made a call to the same DM and explained to him that I ""wasn't going to pay for service"". He got off the phone and told me that I could TRY to go to the full service store to see what they could do and that was it. As we were talking, one of the guys they had working on my car didn't check his bay was cleared before he rolled a customer's car out of it which could have seriously hurt somebody.

So I called a tow, and realized that I didn't have the invoice they gave me last night on me. I figured I'd need it to show the store at Federal the service they did, so I went back to the shop and asked if I could get another copy. As I was waiting, the same guy who worked on my car last night/didn't clear the bay asked me if my car was running better and gave me a thumbs up. I was kinda dumbfounded and was like no, I have to take it to another shop...? and I guess he was too because he just stood there and stared at me. Then the manager came back out - and he had the audacity to print me another invoice on plain copy paper so that it didn't have the warranty info on the back. I know that's not how they're supposed to do it because I watched another employee load their special invoice paper into the printer last night for my first invoice. He just said, ""yeah, there's the service we did, but this one doesn't have the warranty info."" At this point I knew the dude was trying to swindle me so I just thanked him and waited to get towed. When I got to the full service shop, one of the guys there asked me what was up with it. I told him I came from the original shop and he said that they get cars from that shop very often for similar mistakes. I was so glad the guy already sympathized with me because I can't afford the price of a new oil pump/labor for a mistake I didn't make. The guy called the same district manager to see what they could do. He came into the office to let me know that it was all covered and that the original shop would foot the bill. So I asked if that was how it usually worked, and he said yeah this happens a lot with them. It clicked that the manager at the original shop obviously didn't want to foot the bill for his mistake so he was gonna try whatever he could to get me to not mention that they nearly ruined my car and pay for the service. I got a call back from the full service shop saying they don't think it's the oil pump and that they think I need a full engine rebuild.

My sister does not want to turn off the cameras because then she won’t have any security. Is he violating the terms of his bond by viewing the cameras? Any insight would be lovely.",No-Bathroom300,0,2,1.0
984,Limited bathroom issue,118k65n,"Throw Away since a lot of people I work with have reddit.

First off, I’m a Federal Employee and I work in CA.

This morning, out of the blue, we all got word that there’s a hiring event going on for the rest of the week and that 200+ new hires will be walking around the first floor only and are not allowed on the 2nd or 3rd floor.  In addition, the first floor bathrooms are off limits as they are being used for drug testing.  Here’s the kicker though, the second floor bathrooms are closed due to maintenance.  So…every current employee in the building (approx 200+ employees in the building) have to use the third floor bathrooms or the single toilet unisex bathroom on each floor.  The new hires only have the unisex single toilet option on the first floor.

Well, a worst case scenario happened this afternoon…the contracted custodian lady closed the third floor bathroom for cleaning!  There’s no scheduled time for closing the bathrooms, but she usually does it in the afternoons.  

When I addressed this issue with HR, they just shrugged their shoulders.  I contacted our union and they seem uninterested in addressing the issue as well.  This just feel like its against human rights not to have an available bathroom.  Who can I contact or address this too?",TAholdingitin1334,1,0,0.33
985,[South FL] My mom was tricked by a clinic to treat her Neuropathy and scammed out of $5000 when she decided not to go through with the treatment,118k2fy,"Back in August, my mother saw an ad on local television to be part of a treatment program to fix her neuropathy symptoms. We went to the clinic and the doctor (who is a registered D.C.), as friendly as he was, warned us that her nerves were operating at an 80-82% loss and that doing nothing means she may have to have her legs amputated and live in a wheelchair. For $4,997.00 they will custom order her a 'Red Light Therapy', 'Blueprint Pro Unit' and 'Rebuilder Therapy'. She was scared over the idea of losing her legs, so she agreed.

She signed a very small contract that reads, in part, ""I understand that nutritional supplements, equipment and professional protocols that I received are non-refundable. Once equipment is ordered I understand it's in my possession. I understand that to get the full results with my condition the recommendations have to be followed. There is no guarantee of results and patient / Client understands and acknowledges this,"" which she, of course, signed.

After the unit was ready, I went and picked it up for her. Around that time, she'd been talking to her cousin, a lawyer, about it and her cousin was not only confused on everything she was explaining but also said that this sort of treatment should have been processed through her PC doctor and/or Medicare. The clinic made no attempt that such a thing, and instead took her money directly from her debit card. She continued to call around and understood that what she'd ordered was at the very least shady, if not a full-on scam.

We went back to the clinic to return the unit and all the other lotions and gels that came with it, and they explained to us that because we took the unit, we are not eligible for a refund. However, the second of the two-page contract states, in part, ""If the patient discontinues the program or requests a refund it is based on normal treatment fees and no time of service/ or plan discount(s). The fees will be prorated and a refund will be issued to the payment method.""

Her cousin advised her to write and sign a letter stating that the unit/treatment were never approved by her PCP or approved by her HMO. It also has 'no code number' as medical equipment and is considered 'alternative treatment'. She also asks for a full refund in the letter.

Now, I took photos of the contract, the letter she wrote, an image of her leaving the unit at the clinic, and the outside of the clinic. I also snagged one of their business cards.

She disputed the charge with her bank, Bank of America, and they initially refunded her the money, but a month later a 'temporary hold' was reissued in the amount of $4,997.00 and it has not yet been reversed, confirmed, or resolved.

I turn to you, /r/legaladvice, in the hopes that something can be done in this matter. My mom lives on a fixed income, and that $5000 would go an incredibly long way in helping her with rent and expenses. Thank you very much for reading this.",Introspects,2,1,0.6
986,Can I prevent my father from contacting me and showing up at my job? MA,118k29n,"I live in Massachusetts. My father was a physically and emotionally abusive parent who I cut all contact with in 2020 to protect myself. This January (2023) he has begun sending me post cards weekly at my home. 3 times I have asked him to stop, via email, which he has totally disregarded. This I reported to the police department. The postcards are not threatening in nature, but the fact that he has my address and is completely ignoring my no-contact requests is deeply distressing.

He has also begun showing up at a venue where I occasionally work. The first time he came in January, I was there, saw him, and left immediately. Since then, I have made multiple requests, also via email, that he not come on specific dates, which he has disregarded. I have not interacted him in person, because those dates I was planning to go socially, rather than professionally, so when I heard he was there, I just didn't go. However, I have a date coming up that I am hired to be there, so I cannot just leave if he shows up. The venue has said they cannot ask him to leave unless he behaves poorly at their events. I also have dates that I've been offered and have not yet confirmed because I do not know if he will be there.

Today I applied for an abuse prevention order. It was denied. The judge explained that while I absolutely would have been granted one in 2014/2015 when I was still living at home and the abuse was occurring, or even likely in 2020, when I last had contact with him and he behaved in a physically intimidating manner, because I have had no contact with him for three years and therefore he has not behaved in a threatening or abusive manner, I can't prove fear of imminent physical harm. I also do not qualify for an anti-harrasment order, because he is a relative.

Is there anything I can do here, either to stop him from contacting me or to stop him from showing up at the venue when I am working and therefore cannot leave? This is impacting my income and is also really deeply distressing.",Background-Koala992,2,4,0.87
987,Medical negligence in the UK,118k29j,"
I am looking for advice on something that happened 1.5 years ago when my son was born - following an emergency c-section I was let out of the hospital without any medicines/antibiotics - just iron tablets.
I have received at home visits from midwives 1,2,5 days after being discharged and in every single occasion I have begged for help as the amount of pain I was experiencing was indescribable and I have also explained to the last midwife who visited me that I had stopped drinking because I was scared of having to get up.
I was told on multiple occasions this was normal.
I was ammited to hospital 2 days later with signs of infection (doctor in the a&e advised I already had signs of infection on the day I was discharged) - I was then given a dose of antibiotics, following that initial dose, one of the nurses came into the bedroom, signed for another dose of antibiotics which I was never given, delaying further assistance.
I was promised that due to my situation a midwife would always be available to assist me while I had my baby with me, but I was then left on my own with excruciating pains and with a newborn who needed attentions and care.
On the third day I called for help as my baby was crying, I called and waited for over 30+ minutes, I was in distress due to the situation and the baby crying and after multiple attempts I decided to try and get up on my own,  my stiches opened up and I bled for hours - this has left me with a horrendous looking scar, which has deformed my body.

This whole experience has scarred me, I have absolutely no recollection of the first month of my son's life due to being constantly in pain and unable to look after him. I was left on my own while fighting for my life and I am now extremely scared of having any more children and being constantly reminded of this by the scar that has completely wiped my confidence.

I do apologise for the long story, but I am now looking for any sort of help or guidance you may offer as per what options I have should I want to sue the NHS and seek compensation for what I would describe as medical negligence.
If you are able to assist in any way, I would really appreciate it.

Also apologies for any spelling mistakes but english is not my first language.",businessgo0se,2,1,1.0

989,Can a university fine you for a key you never owned or lost in the first place?,118jyti,"I live in the dorms at my uni, If it helps, its a Texas University. 

Residents receive keys to get into their dorm rooms. A previous roommate lost hers and I have stated three times now it was not me or my other roommate. I even had my actual key that was checked out under my name.

As on the 21st of February, I received an email stating that if no action is taken, I will be fined for the missing key if I can't set up a meeting with the supervisor before the 26th which gives me 5 days.

If they do fine me even after giving the evidence and my other roommates statement, do I have the right to get a lawyer involved to fight the fine I have no reason being the target for??",RefuseDry,2,0,0.5
