Full Quote:

>When asked whether he wants to stay in Boston long term, Brown is noncommittal.

>“I don’t know. As long as I’m needed. It’s not up to me,” he says. “We’ll see how they feel about me over time and I feel about them over time. Hopefully, whatever it is, it makes sense. But I will stay where I’m wanted. I will stay where I’m needed and treated correct.”

>When asked how long he wants to play with Tatum, Brown keeps his focus on the immediate future.

>“I just enjoy the time that you have now,” he says. “If it’s your whole career, it’s your whole career. If it’s not, it’s not. Some of the greatest players of all time haven’t finished with their organization. Michael Jordan retired a Wizard. As much as we like it here and enjoy being here, you see where life takes you. You see how the process goes. All you do is really focus on what’s in front of you right now, to be honest. But I don’t really know or want to answer that question because that type of stuff makes Celtics fans speculate and go crazy.

>Still, Sabonis was nervous about the crowd response before his home debut against the [Minnesota Timberwolves](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/min/minnesota-timberwolves). As he taped himself up the way he always did before games, Sabonis was surprised to see the rest of his teammates jog to the court without him; the Kings followed a different pregame routine, and hit the floor earlier than the Pacers had. Sabonis would come out alone, all eyes on him.

4,"[TalkBasket] Klay Thompson after facing Rockets: ""It is strange looking over there how young their team is. The Rockets I used to play in the 2010s were seasoned vets... They had such a great team that almost knocked us off and I had a lot of respect for those Rockets teams and now I just feel old.""",11xkkc8,"> Asked in postgame about his mentality heading to the game knowing that Golden State urgently needs a road win, Thompson took an interesting inspiration that kept him going for the entire game.

> “I actually told myself, I was pretending I’m playing [the] 2018 Rockets where it was a battle every time we used to play those guys,” Thompson said. “They’re still young, they’re talented and you can’t take anybody lightly, especially at this point in the season.”

> And as four years have quickly passed through, Thompson can only feel old that he is now facing a new and youthful generation of the Rockets club. With Jalen Green, Alperen Sengun, and Jabari Smith Jr., Houston is currently taking its time for a gradual rebuilding phase following the Harden era. 

> “It is strange looking over there how young their team is,” Thompson continued in his presser. “The Rockets I used to play in the 2010s were seasoned vets, all littered throughout that roster. Obviously, James is one of the best players in that franchise’s history and they brought on CP too.

> “They had such a great team that almost knocked us off and I had a lot of respect for those Rockets teams and now I just feel old playing these young bucks.”


Same, Klay, same. Time really flies so fast. That 2018 war between Dubs and Rockets is truly legendary. Sadly, Harden and Houston failed to win a chip.

When asked about it, this was his response: “It’s just paper.”",11xmlcn,"Dillon Brooks has lost about as much money through fines and suspensions this season as most people have made in their lives, and it seems like he could not care less. Kinda wild how much money flows through the NBA.

6,"[Spears] “I want bigger things for my wife and myself,” Josh Hart said. “Just find a home somewhere where we are valued and really like living there. And I think that can be New York. I would love for it to be New York and hopefully the organization feels the same way.”",11xk6f0,"> Josh Hart and his wife, Shannon, dated in high school in Silver Spring, Maryland, and they got married in South Beach Miami in August 2021. Shannon Hart is now pregnant with twins, the couple’s first children. It was tough for Shannon Hart to get support in person from family and friends when her husband played for the Blazers in the Pacific Northwest.

> “Portland was good, but it was just so far and I’m not from the West Coast,” Hart recently told Andscape. “It was tough. Not on me, but more so on my wife because she’s not a huge fan of flying. So, she’s all the way in the Pacific Northwest, not really flying, just by herself. That was one of the things that was weighing on me a little bit, just seeing her struggle with that. So, me being gone but being close to home, it’s been great.”

> New York is 12-4 since acquiring Hart, who told Andscape that he hopes to sign a long-term deal with the Knicks. His wife is on board with that decision, too.

> “I want bigger things for my wife and myself,” Hart said. “Just find a home somewhere where we are valued and really like living there. And I think that can be New York. I would love for it to be New York and hopefully the organization feels the same way.”

> Hart said he and his wife are living temporarily on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. If signed by the Knicks long term, the self-described homebody will likely find a new home near the Knicks’ practice facility in Westchester, New York, during the offseason. Hart, who is in the final stages of releasing his first wine, also has wine bottles to move from Portland.

> “We love the Upper West Side, but them brownstones are expensive as [expletive],” Hart said. “It’s crazy. So, I’ll probably be a Westchester guy. But this summer, hopefully, everything goes well and maybe I’ll be a Westchester guy and find a nice little country club somewhere, play some golf.”

**Q: Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid are discussed at length in the NBA’s MVP conversation. You and Giannis Antetokounmpo were teammates for some time. From your perspective, should he be in that conversation this season?** 

> *Oh yeah! For sure. I think that he is in the conversation. I think Joker is probably No. 1 right now. He’s having another incredible superb season, but I think that Giannis and JT are in that conversation as well. I think that they’re both having great seasons.* 

**Q: You guys are doing well in the East. Where do you think the Celtics still need to improve to close the season well and make another NBA Finals run?** 

> I think closing out games are going to be the biggest things for us. Rebounding the ball and closing out games and keeping our turnovers down. And I think that really for us, that’s going to win a lot of games especially in the playoffs. 

**Q: Who is a swingman in the league you’ve played against this season that people should watch out for in the near future?** 

> *I would say Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Of course, people know about him because he was an All-Star this year, but he’s one of those guys that is still a young guy. He’s an excellent player.*

24,The Nuggets have 10 games to play and Jokić is 69 assists from breaking Chamberlain’s 55-year-old season assist record.,11xc74j,"1968, Wilt Chamberlain carried his team to 62 wins, the best record in the league, leading the league in total assists with 702. This was the only time a center had ever and would ever be the assist leader.

Wilt’s 702 assist record for a center surpassed his own 630 from ‘67 and Russell’s 472, also from ‘67.

Until this year, no center outside of Wilt has ever accumulated 600 assists in a single season. This year, Jokić has accumulated 634 assists and even has a shot at leading the league.

For Jokić to break Wilt’s assist record for a center, he would have to average at least:

10 games - 6.9apg

9 games - 7.7apg

8 games - 8.7apg

7 games - 9.9apg

6 games - 11.5apg

Bulls are now 2 up on the Wizards for the 10th seed, a half game back on Toronto for the 9 seed and one game back back of Atlanta for the 8 seed (which would really improve their odds of making it out).",BigPoppaPuff,73,650,0.97
26,"Since the All-Star break, Utah Jazz rookie Walker Kessler has been the league leader in blocks per game with 3.8 BPG. He is averaging an entire block per game more than the DPOY favorite Brook Lopez (2.8).",11x7h4m,"Kessler has been sensational, and while he won't get true ROTY considerations, he definitely deserves to be in the conversation as a third party. The impact of him on defense is so big that in a weird sense, it has almost made me forget that he's a rookie because I take it so for granted. He looks very polished defensively. 

A notable fact to mention, if post-Allstar break is too small of a sample size for some reason, is that Kessler is 2nd in BPG since the turn of the calendar year (2.9 since January 1st) behind Jaren Jackson Jr.'s 3.0 BPG. He is 4th on the entire season, behind JJJ, Claxton, and Brook Lopez. He is a rookie. Future DPOY?

Teach me your ways.’,11wk5km,"> **Goodwill:** With what we’ve heard about Ja, it feels like eight games – not necessarily from a punitive standpoint – but just eight games in two weeks, does it feel like that part of this is being a bit rushed?

> **Bomani:** Look man, that dude said he went and learned some breathing exercises and he got this all under control. What? That was my thing as I was sitting there listening. I was like ‘You got this all figured out in a week? Teach me your ways.’ Like, whenever people talk about their problems in the terms that they were using to talk about his problems… so basically, all you needed was a week off of work? That was it? And you got to the bottom of everything. But did you really get to the bottom of it though? I ask that because the Grizzlies have now decided they’re not going to stay in any city after any road games, and I’m like, ‘what are we doing here?’ None of this appears to make sense to me. If he’s good, I hope that he’s good. It just doesn’t seem like this is something that you can fix in the way that they described fixing it for him.

34,Taurean Prince had the most efficient 30 point game in at least 40 years,11x7ig4,"EDIT: upon double checking Davis Bertans holds this title. He had a game in February 2021 vs the Nuggets where he scored 35 points, shooting 9-11 from the field, all 3’s and a perfect 8-8 at the line, good for a 121 TS% statmuse gave me the wrong information, apologies. However this game was played in an empty gym with no fans which made shooting *a lot* easier in many instances. Plus it’s still a historically efficient game for prince so worth the post imo

35 points on just 13 shots and 4 free throws 119 true shooting. 

Statmuse only tracks TS% going back to the 1982-1983 season but having TS% well over 100 like this was basically impossible before 3 pointers. 

Prince beats out Richie Frahm who scored 31 points on 11 shots December 20th 2003, for a mere 117 true shooting, he averaged just 3 points and didn’t score more than 17 any other game that season, or his entire career for that matter. He never averaged more than 4 PPG and was a journeymen at best. Prince is arguably a journeyman himself and has had a much better career. Somewhat similarly. prince’s season high was just 19 before his 35 point outburst tonight.

Frahm statline: 31 points, 10-11 from the field, 6-7 from 3, 5-5 at the line

Prince statline: 35 points, 12-13 from the field, 8-8 from 3, 3-4 at the line

If I was forced to predict someone to break this record I would go with Isaiah Joe. Elite shooter who mostly will just shoot 3’s, can easily have a game where he goes like 8 for 9 from deep, but won’t mess up his efficiency by taking any stupid 2’s.",AdviceEuphoric4852,32,216,0.94

He will be a restricted free agent this summer, and will undoubtedly have multiple suitors looking to pry him from the Lakers — especially after stat lines like Sunday’s. Both the Lakers and Reaves’ camp have interest in Reaves re-signing in Los Angeles, according to multiple league sources who were granted anonymity so that they coud speak freely. The max the Lakers can offer Reaves is a four-year, $50.8 million contract if they chose to use his Early Bird Rights, but they also have the power to match any contract he signs with another team.

Should Reaves keep leading the tank gang or look to join a contender this offseason? The Lakers will have to extend Dlo and Rui as well, not to mention Beasley’s team option, so it’s possible at least one of them will leave or get traded.

44,"When Kareem retired, he was top 20 all-time in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.",11xkxls,"Here is where Kareem ranked all-time in the 5 main counting stats when he retired at the end of 1988-89 season:

|Stat|Total|Kareem Rank|
:--|:--|:--|
|Points|38,387|1st|
|Rebounds|17,440|3rd|
|Assists|5,660|14th|
|Steals|1,160|19th|
|Blocks|3,189|1st|

Couple caveats with this is that the NBA didn't start officially recording steals and blocks until the 1974-75 season, so there would have been plenty of guards that had more steals than Kareem. Wilt and Russell would have been 1/2 in blocks, but Kareem did end up 1st in blocks despite missing out on them counting his first 4 seasons, so he might have retired 1st in blocks anyway. 

With all that said, I didn't realize he had racked up so many assists over his career. We often remember Wilt and Walton as being great passing centers from the 60's and 70's, but Kareem was no slouch either when it came to dishing the rock. At 7'2"", he's still the tallest player to ever average 5+ assists for a season (according to basketball reference heights at least).

&nbsp;

LeBron was the next player I though of when I looked up Kareem's stats, but due to playing in a different era, and the league having 75 years worth of seasons for other players to rack up big numbers, his ranks don't quite stack up to Kareem. Here is where LeBron currently ranks all-time in the 5 core counting stats:

|Stat|Total|LeBron Rank|
:--|:--|:--|
|Points|38,450|1st|
|Rebounds|10,606|32nd|
|Assists|10,371|4th|
|Steals|2,180|9th|
|Blocks|1,067|91st|

Still really impressive, but just in a different light. Depending on when Chris Paul retires, LeBron will finish either 3rd or 4th in assists and will still hold the all-time scoring record, which is just bananas to think about in the context of literally any other player's skill set all-time.",RecordReviewer,16,19,0.79

I want guys to care about this stuff...The only thing with Embiid that I don't like and I think it's more the people around him that get in his head about how everyone is against him.""",11wijxb,"Russilo continues: "" Honestly dude for someone who doesn't have that much playoff success he actually escapes the kind of criticism that we would have for a player that is his level. Normally this guy is getting shit on at this stage of his career and I don't think that happens from a national or neutral level."" 

Thought that since that sub has been getting bombarded with MVP posts that this was a valuable look into the psyche of Embiid and his burning desire to be the best.

Things could change around by the end of the season some. But, it'll likely be those 7 teams fighting for playoffs spots though (with some a lot more likely than others to get in and have certain seeds).

77,[OC] Film Analysis on the Misuse of AD Offensively,11wt54w,"So through out a lot of AD's tenure on the Lakers, specifically this year, I feel like the team has done a pretty poor job of running the offense through AD and I decided to try and break down some recent film to look more into it. He makes plenty of mistakes so this post isn't attempting to absolve blame, but more just give constructive criticism to how he's being used offensively. Because of this I'm gonna focus on taking somewhat rare examples of the Lakers making smart decisions around AD to point out what they should do more often rather than just posting low lights

&#x200B;

Very curious for other's thoughts on what I'm suggesting they do more of, if you think the analysis is fair, or if you think you have even better ideas on how the team should be utilizing Davis

&#x200B;

PS This is my first time doing this so I'm very open to constructive criticism as there's at least a chance I'll try and do more stuff like this in the future

&#x200B;

Lets start with some examples of lack of off ball movement:

&#x200B;

[In this clip](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxPNDeyidPFfWSE3UPqYm8yFeW5xsw_KIz) you see the entire defense focused on him. Rui cuts to the middle of the paint but he cuts to a place where there's no open passing lane, but there's no meaningful movement on offense and it leads to a lazy iso jumper.

&#x200B;

[In this one](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxIUQdBUcwgAtQ67d3JizXFPvH1fGhV0YW) you see something somewhat similar with vando cutting to the middle, AD being doubled with  every player looking at him. He misses the shot but the lack off off ball movement just makes it incredibly easy for the defense to focus on him while cutting off passing lanes.

&#x200B;

Now if you watch the Lakers you've seen a ton of plays like this, especially since the raptors spent most of the game selling out to stop AD recently. The rest of the team stepped up in that game and punished the raptors for their scheme but as teams replicate the strategy its made the holes in the rest of the lakers offense much more clear. I'm not gonna spam a bunch more clips like the two before, but just wanted to give you examples of how the lakers offense running through AD is often just getting AD in iso and hoping he can beat a double/triple (which is obviously a terrible way to run an offense).

&#x200B;

Dibble hand off (aka DHO) potential:

&#x200B;

[Here](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx-FCN3q1vHLzKHTyWmtszJHOymzP0yTTd) you see  a DHO between AD and Reaves where ADs defender drops, reaves defender picks him up giving reaves a solid look. Not only this but Brown Jr's defender slides to reaves creating a wide open 3 on top of everything else

&#x200B;

[Plays like that](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxxigNpGj6clRkEU-O6xS2IQ9cQCftrvZv) open up opportunities like this where you can get Davis in single coverage once again because the defense has to respect his teammates on some level

&#x200B;

[Now after you've](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxSGzM7VkY8REtP5Rs2yezTzCF-CidhDup) established the threat of that it leads to plays where teams have to respect it, once again giving the best player on the team easy looks

&#x200B;

Off Ball cuts:

&#x200B;

[AD isn't jokic](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxEqO6IaSztQpJMT-SLXFuwp-9y1e2Cchn) but there are 100% ways you can set him up for easy passes to help create shots for others like this. 

&#x200B;

[Cutting more even when AD isnt the focal point of the play can open up](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxpVPgfUYDfXjXFJQyoeBX2gIMwjES0wxN) shots for him as well. He can be very effective off ball, and the more you can do stuff like this the harder it is for a coach to solely rely on swarming him

&#x200B;

Guard Screen potential:

&#x200B;

[Here](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxiRO1YGg_KN-fCncgBWwE0YjPgagQQ0TO) you have Beasley screen for Davis setting him up to take a midrange jumper. As we all know this isnt the exact spot you want AD shooting, but its so much better than what you see far too often -- him being swarmed with no one working to get open, often resulting in far worse jumpers

&#x200B;

[He misses this](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxnCLE2Zr9YKIITM-OLTE53U0YbatzgGPa) and once again its not ideal but seeing them try something like this is still an improvement over a lot of their stagnant possessions

&#x200B;

Id love to see them explore using guards as screeners off ball too when AD has the ball to create open shots for shooters while AD is posted up with the ball. Opening up a couple good shots for him to easily pass out to could really force teams to focus more time, energy and attention on the perimeter. [This isn't a perfect example](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxMGPsKPmyyEggnpkwZOULcjJVvRbYojxa) of that but its at least them using motion off ball to actually take advantage of the gravity AD creates so regularly

&#x200B;

Pick n Rolls (aka PnRs):

&#x200B;

This is an obvious one because AD is obviously a great lob threat, but I still feel as if the team doesn't try and use PnRs to their advantage as much as they should (LeBron coming back could help this a lot tbf)

&#x200B;

[The play](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxzTgI-l4OoFBEDagEpAeh-JNMQCHfnIK9) doesn't even have to be trying to force AD the ball, you can use it to open up passes to other players, which can in turn get enough of the defenses attention to get him open looks if the defense respects the other players just a bit

&#x200B;

[A similar example to the last](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxsZ8jPfO8x0nJD6ShoIjXmTOCEHDzWJA-)

&#x200B;

[A play like this](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxwyy2PBiqj6oQON9eV7NKHOrDz0QZg2bb) requires the defense respecting the guard on the roll, but this is the sort of pay off we can also see as we punish teams more from doubling AD. This is very achievable with LeBron, was a staple of the 2020 run, and yet its just severely under utilized even when he's playing

&#x200B;

[Another example](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxzTgI-l4OoFBEDagEpAeh-JNMQCHfnIK9) of an imperfect jumper that's still much better than a ton of their offensive possessions

80,NBA Related Data Science Project,11x5uqp,"Hey everyone, I have been a fan of the NBA for a while and I am looking for some ideas for a data science project that is centred around that. I plan on using a Bayesian framework and if I can come up with an interesting question with appropriate data, hope to employ a hierarchical model. 

I have some ideas of what I can look into, but also wanted to make this post and see if any of you guys have any interesting ideas? Maybe some NBA fan data scientists in here who have a question but don't have the time to explore it? Let me know what you guys think of the following brief snippets:

&#x200B;

1. I came across the topic of 2 for 1 possessions which peeked my interest. A 2 for 1 possession is a strategy used during the last minute of the quarter or period. This strategy is done by timing a shot to make sure that the team that has the possession of the ball can regain possession and have enough time to shoot again. They are somewhat polarizing, with some thinking that the strategy is very poor because the play is often rushed and the team ends up taking a bad shot for the sake of a 2 for 1. Is it really better to take 2 potentially poor shots versus 1 good shot? Are certain types of shots (i.e. a three pointer vs midrange vs layup) better to perform with 2 for 1s in mind? Not sure what other factors or predictors I can come up with but, but that is the idea. I would also need to figure out how I would quantify the ""effectiveness"" of a 2 for 1 possession, or where I could even find such data. 
2. The effect of a team's offensive/defensive rating and its players offensive/defensive ratings. Obviously there is correlation there, but I think it may be interesting to look into player transfers and the effect over time.  How does a player's defensive rating change from before they joined the team to when they have been with the team for a bit? Are more highly defensive rated teams better at developing a players defensive rating, or is it more about the player's own training regiment. Does having better defenders on your team, make you a better defender? Unsure about what covariates I can use to construct a model here, but this framework may lend itself nicely to something hierarchical? Team level stats having effect on player level stats.
3. Player misutalization. There are instances in basketball where one player is doing really well, then they get traded to a new team with a different play style, and suddenly they are ""terrible"". This isn't necessarily because they player suddenly became worse, but because the new team isn't employing the player in plays or setting up in a way that leverages that players strengths. Sometimes teams realize that, make some technical adjustments and the player is suddenly playing really well again. I think it would be interesting to explore this further. Again not sure about how to set up a model or find data that would let me do some analysis. I would also need to see if there us some data on ""player strengths"". Maybe the response here can be some simple production statistics, like player plus/minus while the predictors are things like the type of play, the players strengths, interaction between the two, etc. 
4. A more simplistic idea is salary predictions based on various other stats like number of games played, points per game, winshares, injury proneness, etc. A bit simple and boring in my opinion, but maybe could discover something unexpected. Results could be used to forecast what a free agent may expect to be paid for their next contract or what to work on to increase that number the quickest.",BlackCoatBrownHair,13,19,0.88

""I think obviously the goal is for LeBron to return at some point before the season concludes, but what I'm hearing is that still might be a push right there, him returning at some point. I reported a few weeks ago... the Lakers had to try and do whatever they could to try to win as many games as possible to give LeBron James as much time to recover as possible. So that means that even when he does come back, he might not be fully healthy, but just trying to buy him some time. With that said, I don't know how realistic it is that he returns with some games left in the regular season. That is definitely the goal, LeBron James is shooting for that, I just don't know how realistic it is right now.. Can LeBron come back the final two games of the regular season? ...

After two more games (a [win against the Wizards](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202303120PHI.html) and tonight's [loss against the Bulls](https://www.nba.com/watch/video/full-focus-bulls-snap-sixers-winning-streak-in-double-overtime)) nothing has changed - Embiid's average stats are still crazy playing at home in the jerseys (40 points, 11 boards, 4 assists, 0.86 steals and 2.7 blocks), he is a cumulative +40 in those games, and the Sixers have only won three of the seven, despite winning 70% of their home games for the season.

Miami are the last team to play them in these jerseys, three days before the end of the regular season on April 6. Mark your calendars (or don't - this is still a pretty small sample size, even if it's weird their home record is so much worse in these jerseys than out of them).",Mackinaw,1,9,0.76

\#	|	Team	|	Δ	|	Record	|	Comment	|
--: 	|	:--	|	:--	|	:-:	|	:--	|
1	|	[](/MIL) Bucks	|	--	|	51-20	|	The Bucks are rolling. As winter fades away in Milwaukee, they have emerged as the clear-cut favorites to win the East -- and maybe the whole thing. They have a 2.5-game cushion over the second-place Celtics and Sixers with only 11 games left, and Vegas has finally given them their due respect as the title frontrunners. Giannis is the best player in the sport even if nobody wants to give him the MVP, Brook Lopez might be playing the best basketball of his All-Star career at 34, and Khris Middle is basically back to normal. Watching this team the last few months has been a treat as a fan, it certainly feels like the best Bucks team I'll see in my lifetime.	|
2	|	[](/PHI) 76ers	|	+2	|	48-22	|	The Sixers are rolling and Joel Embiid might finally lock up a legacy defining piece of hardware. It's hard to argue against the Sixers being one of the hottest teams in the league right now, especially as some of the teams in front of them are having some stumbles down the stretch. A big reason why The Sixers are succeeding? Tyrese Maxey. He's once again found his aggression and his shot from deep. They'll need him and Harden to play at this level to finally break the second round curse.	|
3	|	[](/BOS) Celtics	|	--	|	49-23	|	The Celtics are 7-6 since the All-Star break and have continuously floundered to find any sort of stable footing. The fanbase is fighting over whether to place the blame on Joe Mazzulla or Jayson Tatum, or a combination of the two. Tatum has been hot and cold all season, and recently has played awful. At the same time, Joe Mazzulla has had multiple questionable to outright malpractice coaching decisions, especially when it comes to in-game play calling down the stretch. To make matters worse, the 76ers finally caught up and overtook the Celtics for the 2 seed in the East. It's time to nut up or shut up for the Celtics, and the final 10 games of the season will determine how the fanbase and the team as a whole feels going into the postseason. They've got matchups @Kings, Pacers, Spurs, @Wizards, @Bucks, Jazz, @76ers, Raptors twice at home, and then the Hawks at home to close out the season. The fight for the 2 seed could very well come down to April 4th when the Celtics go into Philly, but before that you have to take care of business and win the games you're supposed to win, or else the Celtics won't even be in a position to fight for 2nd. 	|
4	|	[](/DEN) Nuggets	|	-2	|	48-24	|	Despite remaining on top of the West, the Nuggets have struggled as of late, only winning 2 of their last 7 games. Defense and rebounding have disappeared and allowing second chance points has been a common theme. Despite this, the team is still at full strength and they still have time to adjust and refocus in time for the playoffs.	|
5	|	[](/CLE) Cavaliers	|	+2	|	45-28	|	The Cavs went 5-2 since the previous power rankings and will need to have a 5-4 or better record over the last 9 games to get their first 50 win season without LeBron in 30 years. With 7 of those matchups being against Brooklyn(2x), Houston, Charlotte, Indiana, and Orlando(2x), it would be a massive disappointment for them to go under .500 in this final stretch. Evan Mobley has been special over the last two months, averaging 18.8 ppg on 58.6% ts%, 9.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.4 stocks a game, while cementing himself as a DPOY candidate as the anchor of the Cavs #1 rated defense. On the season, he’s leading the league in defensive win shares, he has the most 3s contested in the league, and is in the 99th percentile rim protection. Cavs fans would take to the streets for anything less than 1st team all-defense for the 21 year old Mobley.	|
6	|	[](/SAC) Kings	|	+2	|	43-27	|	The playoffs are well within the grasps of the Kings.. showing they can beat some of the best teams in the league Fox continues to show he’s the 4th quarter assassin. Sabonis has been on fire throughout this tough stretch putting up triple doubles and making sure this team gets open look with his passing and screens.. Keegan “Keegan Murray” Murray continues to showcase his three point game as he is 22 away from breaking the rookie 3pt record held by Donovan Mitchell. This team continues to their mission to not only stay within the top 6 but have their eyes set on the 1 and 2 seed in the west. 	|
7	|	[](/NYK) Knicks	|	-2	|	42-30	|	[GO NEW YORK GO NEW YORK GO](https://external-preview.redd.it/x8A52EJKcvFkTU7iUgE2Z2vhHQZgFTlnMbKdAUXDQPs.gif?width=356&height=200&format=mp4&v=enabled&s=16c05952ede16ab9207a1ec23b009e6fdcbf37ca)	|
8	|	[](/MEM) Grizzlies	|	+1	|	43-27	|	The team has responded nicely to the absence of Ja while he was on his healing retreat; and frankly there's a ton of praise to be passed around. Tyus Jones getting his first triple double, Dillon Brooks being generally a menace to society, David ""Big Body"" Roddy jumping up the rookie charts, but ultimately the love has to be centered around Jaren Jackson Jr. His last three games have him averaging 28/6/2 as well as keeping his blocks average close at 3. The version of JJJ we saw against Golden State is a guy that could be an MVP caliber player; an elite offensive rim protector and an elite post threat. His fouling has been much better all season, and the race for DPOY between him and Brook Lopez looks to be a photo finish. Ja comes back from his suspension on Monday, with a potential to make his first appearance on Wednesday against the Rockets; just in time to prime up for what looks to be a promising playoff run.	|
9	|	[](/PHX) Suns	|	-3	|	38-33	|	KD slipped during warm ups. Luckily he looks alright and I think he's just out as a precaution, but we gave up two important pieces to get him and it shows given the recent stretch of games while he's been out. 	|
10	|	[](/LAC) Clippers	|	+4	|	38-34	|	Westbrook is starting to settle into his role, and Ty Lue is searching for the best rotations. Already Westbrook has been an amazing facilitator, and even when his shots aren't falling the way he wants to, he is still able to rebound, find open shooters, or just organize the offense in ways we haven't seen since CP3. With only 0.5 games behind the suns, the Clippers could regain the 4th seed for some home field advantage, likely against the Suns.	|
11	|	[](/MIA) Heat	|	+2	|	39-34	|	Things have gone better as of late but they're going to hopefully get better. We went .500 against teams in similar places as us as well as blowing the Grizzlies out of the water. Now we're headed into a couple difficult games mixed in with some games that we have no business losing. The tentative hope would be for us to sneak out of the play-in, although we're probably not getting passed our first match up. If we do avoid having to play the play-in tournament, then best match up to see us in the 2nd round would be the Cavaliers. However, a Celtics - Heat match up would be very exciting to watch. Or maybe a throwback of Knicks vs Heat from forever ago. First thing's first is making sure we are actually involved in the postseason this year. 	|
12	|	[](/BKN) Nets	|	+4	|	39-32	|	The Nets are looking better defensively as the players get more familiar with one another. While the offense depends on good shooting from the three point line, defense is something that the Nets can control every night. High powered offense will give this Nets team trouble as they will have to scramble to match the offensive output some teams can put forth. It's a developmental season for this unit, they will look to hold onto the 6th seed and try to put upa  fight in the playoffs as they move forward to the draft with 2 picks to work with	|
13	|	[](/DAL) Mavericks	|	-2	|	36-35	|	The Mavs may have saved their season off of Maxi Kleber's heroic 3 against the Lakers and Dwight Powell's 22 & 8 on 100% shooting vs the Spurs. The common factor in those games is that Christian Wood played 28+ minutes in both games, which has become a rarity. If the Mavs can finally play their three best players (Luka, Kyrie, Wood) for 30+ minutes each, they should be able to close their weak end of schedule out with dominance.	|
14	|	[](/GSW) Warriors	|	-4	|	36-36	|	The road Warriors strike again. The last time the Warriors lost at home was Feb 11th (8 game win streak) The last time they won on the road was January 30th (11 game losing streak). Nothing like sleeping in your own bed. With his wrist injury Iguodala is essentially retired. The once cornerstone roll player quintessential to the 2015 championship run will be forever a Warrior and fan favorite.	|
15	|	[](/OKC) Thunder	|	+6	|	35-36	|	The Thunder are still somehow alive for a play in spot. This week we play the Clipper twice and Lakers once and will likely determine the feasibility of whether or not we can pull this off. Every game has been super intense because the stakes have been so high (for us). Each win feels more and more important, and all I can really say is: the vibes are immaculate.	|
16	|	[](/LAL) Lakers	|	+2	|	35-37	|	The team built great momentum and really looked poised to get into the top 6, until they dropped two inexcusable losses to the Rockets and Mavericks, specially the Mavericks loss was a gut punch for the team and fan base. The Western standings are so fluid that the Lakers were a Kleber buzzer-beater away from being the 6th seed and now instead are the 10th. They bounced back on Sunday vs. the Magic led by AR’s career-high 35 and the hope is to keep fighting through till the King’s anticipated return within the next couple of weeks. Meanwhile, AD has struggled with his offense as of late and the team needs the big man to tune himself back in for the final push.	|
17	|	[](/TOR) Raptors	|	-1	|	35-37	|	Toronto looks like a team slightly better than .500. For some fans, this gives them hope, while some other fans are worried the Raptors will be stuck in the no man's land for years to come. 	|
18	|	[](/ATL) Hawks	|	-1	|	35-36	|	There's a lot of ""Is Quin Snyder actually better than Nate McMillan"" discourse going on right now. Mostly because the Hawks with Quin have also been terrible, but most people seem to be missing the point of why we brought Quin in the for the final 20 games. It wasn't for him to come in and turn our season around and win us a championship. There was never going to be enough time for Quin to make tangible changes. These last 20 games are for Quin to evaluate the roster and figure out who he does and doesn't want around next year. This team was always going to end up the play-in, but that doesn't matter because this season (and last season) was a wash the day they signed Nate to an extension. I don't really know if the future is bright or bleak, but it's the only thing worth focusing on. 	|
19	|	[](/MIN) TWolves	|	-7	|	35-37	|	Tough season for the Wolves got tougher over the weekend. A season compromised by the injury of Karl-Anthony Towns got worse with Anthony Edwards going down to an ankle injury. Combined with so-so play and tough losses the Wolves season is looking like a disaster. 	|
20	|	[](/CHI) Bulls	|	+4	|	33-37	|	Pat Bev was able to score 14 points in 2 and a half minutes, so I'm feeling better about this team. They have been playing better at both ends, and are actually making 3s now, shooting 42% since the last rankings. Whoever told Demar to start shooting 3s and Vucevic to stop shooting 3s was a genius. The next 2 games against the Sixers will show how this team can handle playoff talent in the East. 	|
21	|	[](/UTA) Jazz	|	+1	|	34-36	|	The Jazz face a choice, so dire, To compete and let the players aspire, Or tank and aim for a high draft pick, For a new franchise star and experience to stick. To give up now, and look ahead, Or fight for wins, and never dread, To a future, with a top prospect in tow, To fight for each win and go with the flow. Lauri Markkanen, a star on the rise, could he lead the team, to a new prize, And Walker Kessler, has blocks to spare, should the Jazz keep pushing, or choose to take care? A dilemma, that weighs heavily on the mind, But the answer, they will eventually find, For every player, coach, and fan, Utah need to hold firm and take a stand.	|
22	|	[](/NOP) Pelicans	|	-3	|	34-37	|		|
23	|	[](/WAS) Wizards	|	-3	|	32-39	|	Lizards are part of a group of animals known as reptiles. They are most closely related to snakes. In fact, some lizards, called sheltopusiks, look like snakes because they have no legs! Many lizards today resemble the ancient reptiles of the dinosaur era. Their ancestors appeared on Earth over 200 million years ago. That was also the last time the Washington Wizards looked like a competitive, cohesive basketball team. Corey Kispert has been incredible these past couple of weeks as he prepares to become a married man. Bradley Beal continues to be enemy number one for fans as nothing he does can appease critics of his large contract. And unfortunately, it looks like the Wes Unseld Jr era could be coming to a close after this season and he continues to have worse rotation management than a flat tire. Its a sad season.	|
24	|	[](/IND) Pacers	|	+1	|	32-39	|	The Pacers continue to tread water as the season winds down. Rookie sixth man Bennedict Mathurin and Tyrese Haliburton's injuries have put a damper on the final weeks, but Indiana still finds themselves just outside the play-in games. 8 of Indiana's last 11 games are against current playoff teams, so they'll probably need some assistance from the other playoff hopefuls if they want to sneak into one of the last spots. 	|
25	|	[](/ORL) Magic	|	+1	|	29-43	|	Probably stuck in the same spot in the standings regardless of what happens rest of the season. So time to just look forward to the lottery and the draft.	|
26	|	[](/POR) Trail Blazers	|	-3	|	31-40	|		|
27	|	[](/CHA) Hornets	|	--	|	22-50	|		|
28	|	[](/SAS) Spurs	|	+1	|	19-52	|	Jeez we gotta stop timing these with drinking weekends, I live in Boston and St. Patty's is always a mess. The Spurs have been on a bit of a heater recently by our standards (as have Houston, for that matter), while Detroit seems to be leaving the rest of the tanks in the dust at this stage. Keldon and Devin have been playing great (Keldon's averaging 22/7/4 while Vassell is averaging 17/4/4), and are showing the potential of being great supporting pieces on a future playoff team. Zach Collins has been a stud since Jakob was traded as well, averaging 16.6/8.1/3.8 on 46/44/91 splits over that time, and more recently has average 23/8/4/1/1.5 on 53/57/100 since getting choked out by MPJ in a game. We have NOP, MIL, WAS, @BOS, UTA, @GSW, @SAC coming up over the next two weeks, home stretch time!	|
29	|	[](/HOU) Rockets	|	+1	|	18-53	|	Jabari Smith's surge mirrors what we saw from Jalen Green after the all star break last year, and it has brought newfound optimism to the Rockets fanbase, and KJ Martin seems to have stepped up in tandem. Make no mistake, the tank is still in effect, but we're seeing the first signs that the team could make the step up that is demanded next season.	|
30	|	[](/DET) Pistons	|	-1	|	16-56	|	James Wiseman is coming off of what was probably the best game of his career last night against Miami. I've still got mixed feelings about trying to develop both him and Duren, but they have looked nice together at times recently - particularly against Denver when they were throwing each other lobs. Otherwise Ivey's cooled off on his shooting recently but his ballhandling continues to, generally, be getting stronger as the season wears on. Eugene Omoruyi has been a surprisingly strong late season addition that much of our fanbase would rather retain over Marvin Bagley. That said, the tank rolls on as we look toward a draft that seems to have more question marks in it - not less - as we inch closer to it.	|",powerrankingsnba,46,102,0.93

Also there is so much more technology now used in other sports for reviews like Hawk-eye, infrared etc. NBA is extremely profitable and they shudnt cheap out on things that improve the game.

If there is anything that demotivates me sometimes from watching NBA it’s refereeing, because it’s too impactful on games",popolenzi,23,55,0.77

96,Every franchise's all-time leader in games played.,11wmr4t,"Giannis became the Bucks all-time leader in games played last night, and that got me curious at who the leader was in games played for each franchise. 

Here's the list in order of most games played to least:

|Franchise|Player|Games|
:--|:--|:--|
|Dallas Mavericks|Dirk Nowitzki|1522|
|Utah Jazz|John Stockton|1504|
|San Antonio Spurs|Tim Duncan|1392|
|Indiana Pacers|Reggie Miller|1389|
|Los Angeles Lakers|Kobe Bryant|1346|
|Boston Celtics|John Havlicek|1270|
|Houston Rockets|Hakeem Olajuwon|1177|
|Philadelphia 76ers|Hal Greer|1122|
|New York Knicks|Patrick Ewing|1039|
|Detroit Pistons|Joe Dumars|1018|
|Oklahoma City Thunder|Gary Payton|999|
|Phoenix Suns|Alvan Adams|988|
|Washington Wizards|Wes Unseld|984|
|Minnesota Timberwolves|Kevin Garnett|970|
|Miami Heat|Dwyane Wade|948|
|Chicago Bulls|Michael Jordan|930|
|Sacramento Kings|Sam Lacey|888|
|Atlanta Hawks|Dominique Wilkins|882|
|Golden State Warriors|Stephen Curry|872|
|Portland Trail Blazers|Clyde Drexler|867|
|Cleveland Cavaliers|LeBron James|849|
|Denver Nuggets|Alex English|837|
|Memphis Grizzlies|Mike Conley|788|
|Los Angeles Clippers|DeAndre Jordan|750|
|Milwaukee Bucks|Giannis Antetokounmpo|712|
|Charlotte Hornets|Dell Curry|701|
|Orlando Magic|Nick Anderson|692|
|Toronto Raptors|DeMar DeRozan|675|
|Brooklyn Nets|Buck Williams|635|
|New Orleans Pelicans|David West|530|

Some notes:

First off for my Sonics fans, if the thought of GP being the all-time leader in games played for the Thunder doesn't sit right, you can replace him on this list with Russell Westbrook who played 821 games for the Thunder. 

The Pelicans/Hornets thing might seem complicated at first, but it's pretty simple. The Pelicans get credit for all the games in New Orleans and the Hornets get credit for all the games in Charlotte (despite the fact that's not exactly how things played out). 

I mentioned Giannis as the reason for this post in the first place, and it's largely because I had no clue who the Bucks leader was in games played prior to him. It was Bucks legend  >!Junior Bridgeman!<.

Lastly, here's a list of every player in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons with a single franchise:

1\. Dirk

T-2. Kobe

T-2. Udonis Haslem

That's right despite playing 20 seasons for the Heat, Haslem is still not the franchise leader in games played. I know he's essentially been an assistant coach for the past 5+ seasons, but it shows just how unique he is that he can bring value to 1 franchise for 2 decades despite his limited ability to actually play.",RecordReviewer,41,85,0.93

98,"[OC] Only 4 teams in NBA History have won 22 straight games. The Boston Celtics were the NEXT opponent in 2 of these instances, and both games took place on the SAME DATE, March 18th. Here are other crazy similarities I've found...",11wdo6c,"### Background:
5 years apart from each other, the Houston Rockets and Miami Heat embarked on winning streaks of at least 22 games, an NBA rarity. The Boston Celtics had the unique opportunity to try to snap each streak before it reached 23. The dates of each game were March 18, 2008 and March 18, 2013, respectively. Given the odds of these events taking place on the same date, I thought I would see if there were any other strange coincidences surrounding these streaks/games.
 
The streaking teams involved are the T-Mac/Yao - ""Ming Dynasty"" Rockets and the BBW's Heat (Bron, Bosh, & Wade) (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  better known as ""The Heatles.""
Here are the links to the streaks:    
[https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/HOU/2008_games.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/HOU/2008_games.html)    
[https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIA/2013_games.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIA/2013_games.html)

***
### Streak Similarities: 
 
+ Both the Rockets and Heat won 26 of 27 games, thanks to their streaks.

+ Both the Rockets and Heat were victims of each other's streaks. [Meaning the Rockets beat the Heat during their streak, and the Heat beat the Rockets during theirs.]

+ Both the Rockets and Heat had winning streaks of exactly 4 games immediately preceding the start of their 20+ game streaks. The last 2 wins of those 4-game streaks took place on the *same dates*, 1/23 & 1/25. Both 4-game streaks ended on 1/27. By the way, the days of the week for these dates are exactly the same (i.e. 1/23 is a Monday for both years, etc.). ^**Because ^2008 ^was ^a ^leap ^year, ^and ^2013 ^was ^not, ^the ^days ^of ^the ^week ^are ^no ^longer ^synced ^after ^2/28.

+ Both the Rockets and Heat beat the Atlanta Hawks on 3/12, 6 days prior to their showdown with the Celtics, AND it was their 2nd time beating the Hawks during their respective streaks. Atlanta scored 18 points in the 1st quarter in both of the 3/12 games. 

**Now on to the 3/18 games: Celtics vs. Rockets and Celtics vs. Heat.**

Links to the games:

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201303180BOS.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201303180BOS.html)

***
### Game Similarities: 

+ The Celtics were on a 2 game winning streak coming in to both games.

+ Guess which referee reffed both games (1 guess):          >!Infamous NBA referee Scott Foster officiated both games (because of course he did, but you already knew that didn't you?).!<

+ The winner in each of the 3/18 games went on to win the NBA Championship later that season.

+ Boston made exactly 15 FTs and had 3 players in double figures in both games.

+ The ""No Stats All-Star,"" Shane Battier played in both games for the team that had won 22 straight. He finished with a +/- of **-15** in both games. 😂

+ Paul Pierce played for Boston in both games. 

***
### Notable Missed Similarities: ###
+ Both Ray Allen & Kevin Garnett *could* have played in both games, but each were inactive for 1 of the 2 games, but NOT the same one. 
+ Rajon Rondo *could* have played in both games, but was inactive for 1 of them.


***
### Other tidbits:
+ Coming into the Boston game, the Rockets had a differential of +272 during the streak. The Heat had a differential of +257.

+ Mike Bibby was beaten twice (2/13 & 3/12) by the Rockets playing for TWO different teams during their streak because he was traded from the Kings to the Hawks on 2/16/08. 

+ Larry Hughes took 3 L's (2/7, 2/19, 2/24) from the Rockets because he was traded from the Cavs to the Bulls on 2/21/08.
  Drew Gooden and Shannon Brown were also traded with Hughes, but were inactive in 1 or 2 of the 3 games.

+ Patrick Patterson was beaten twice (2/6 & 2/26) by the Heat because he was traded from the Rockets to the Kings on 2/20/13. Cole Aldrich  and Toney Douglas were also traded with Patterson, but were inactive in 1 of the games.



***
### Related side note: 
##The Boston Celtics played the Golden State Warriors on 12/11/15, who had won 23 straight, so they were ***1 game*** too late from being the opponent in 3 of the 4 instances in which a team was going for their 23rd straight win. Boston, AGAIN, was on a 2 game winning streak coming into that game.

I didn't have time to use any advanced analytics, and I don't have access to Chat GPT, so perhaps someone out there can do a deep dive and see if there are any Fractals, Fibonacci sequences, or Lucas Numbers involved or other crazy similarities that prove we are indeed living in a simulation.

Seems like the Blazers are probably looking to shut him down as they have with Grant but he just wants to carry on playing, honestly it’s pretty admirable that an ageing superstar is still so determined to play despite being fully aware there’s nothing to play for the rest of the season. I think most people of his calibre would be happy just to sit out for the season and take the big checks for front row seats. Blazers fans are lucky to have a great dude like Dame as their franchise guy",tarpoit,154,347,0.94

It’s only been a few games, but the early returns are encouraging: the Heat are 3-1 when he has played in this stretch.

Lowry has been a boost to the Miami Heat bench unit since returning and has proven himself to be a steadying presence that sharply contrasts the sporadic play of Victor Oladipo, who he has replaced in the rotation.

He will still be the owner of one of the worst contracts in Heat franchise history, but it’s nice to see that Spoelstra is finding ways to maximize him in a limited role (and that he apparently is accepting of this new role).",lopea182,25,66,0.85

So much smoke emerged that day that it wouldn’t be surprising if a deal got struck this summer.",11wi8jg,"> But how do the Bulls flank LaVine without Ball, who hindsight reveals could have been the perfect backcourt mate next to LaVine. Ball brought positional size, shooting, perimeter defense, offensive and defensive versatility, facilitating, tempo and, as his teammates say, swagger. Without him, do the Bulls even try to move forward with LaVine?

> Rumors ran rampant on the day of the trade deadline last month, with spicy talks of a potential LaVine deal with New York. So much smoke emerged that day that it wouldn’t be surprising if a deal got struck this summer. The franchises again appear to be headed in different directions, and the two could now help each other.

> LaVine strikes me as the type of player who would love playing in New York.

Should the Bulls blow up their team instead of just looking to acquire an average to above point guard this summer? They’re playing decently with Pat Bev, so just imagine what a serious player could do.

124,Which guard gets the last 1st team All-NBA spot?,11wlhls,"While Luka is obviously a lock, the other 1st team guard spot seems to be up for grabs. Steph/Dame/SGA are the main contenders, though you even have players like Donovan Mitchell making a case. Who gets the spot? Stat comparison:

Steph: 29.8/6.2/6.2 on 50/43/91 splits (66.6 TS%), 46/72 games played

Dame: 32.2/4.7/7.2 on 46/37/91 splits (64.5 TS%), 57/71 games played

SGA: 31.4/4.8/5.5 on 51/35/90 splits (62.6 TS%), 60/71 games played

Mitchell: 27.4/4.1/4.6 on 47/37/87 splits (60.7 TS%), 61/73 games played

I personally think Steph has missed too many games to make it - historically 56 games (if he plays every remaining game) gets you at best 3rd team so it's probably between Dame and SGA assuming both play the rest of the season.",d33jay64,176,36,0.88

129,Dillon Brooks is defending All-Stars more than anyone and better than anyone.,11vqzlf,"[source: this tweet](https://twitter.com/spacesgrizzlies/status/1637440197943083010?s=46&t=YicQXQGzlG12umVyByMRSg)

>Information, Brooks has matched up in the half court defensively 922 times against this year’s All-Stars, the most of any player. He has held those All-Stars, from Tatum to Curry to Durant, to a 45.7% effective field goal percentage, which ranks first among the 72 players to record 400 such matchups. (League average, for comparison, is 54.6.) Among the players who have the most half-court matchups against All-Stars, Brooks is allowing the lowest percentage.

147,Traveling: A Closer Look at an Underrated Skill,11xnwbk,"Greetings, fellow NBA enthusiasts. 

Today, we will delve into a topic that is often overlooked in the game of basketball - traveling. While dribbling is undoubtedly a crucial skill, let us not underestimate the strategic benefits of traveling.

Recent research has shown that when a player takes a few extra steps, they can cover more ground and reach the basket faster, thus increasing their chances of scoring. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Sports Sciences found that traveling can result in a higher field goal percentage, especially for taller players.

Moreover, traveling can create unpredictability on the court and throw off defenders, making it an effective offensive strategy. This is because defenders are conditioned to anticipate certain movements, and traveling can provide a surprising element to the game.

In terms of turnovers, which are a concern for any basketball player, dribbling carries a higher risk than traveling. This is because when a player is dribbling, the ball is exposed to potential theft by the opposing team. In contrast, traveling only results in a turnover if it is detected by the referees, which is not always the case.

Even some of the greatest players in NBA history, such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, have used traveling to their advantage, often in the form of the ""Eurostep"" maneuver. LeBron James is also known for his impressive strides before a dunk, which demonstrates the power of traveling in creating scoring opportunities.

In conclusion, while dribbling is undoubtedly an essential skill in basketball, it is important to recognize the potential advantages of traveling. Research has shown that traveling can lead to higher field goal percentages, create unpredictability, and reduce the risk of turnovers. 

So the next time you see a player take a few extra steps, remember the science behind the skill.",simocm11,13,0,0.25

156,"Which current teams/organizations in the NBA are best at producing productive players from ""nothing""?",11wu094,"Someone brought up how the Lakers have a lot of young players which started/developed there before being traded to other teams where they now thrive. Kyle Kuzma being a prime example of this. Or looking at my Suns, we have Mikal who is really thriving in Brooklyn and should be considered a star. And the current Suns have brought in a lot of ""last chancers"" min-contracts and developed them into productive players. Cam Payne and recently Josh Okogie for example. Not stars by any means, but   
 players other teams would love to have in one role or another.

Of course superstars brought though trade, draft, or free agency can be relied upon to produce, but developing young players into highly effective role players or even stars takes a certain environment and a lot of work. So in y'alls opinion, which organizations are best at young player development? This could be through the draft, trades, or 10 day/two way contracts?",ajteitel,43,3,0.56

160,"Ainge for executive of the year: With only ~10% of the season remaining, the Wolves and Jazz have the same record (.493)",11xczck,"With the season heading towards an end, both the Jazz and Wolves are in the same spot fighting for the play-in. Ainge managed to trade away the core players, getting at least 8 first round picks in return, cleared up cap space, and still added young talent in return.

For reference, Kessler, who Ainge wanted as a Gobert replacement, has so far averaged 12.3 ppg 11.1 rpg, and 3.4 bpg while shooting 79% in March. Gobert so far in March is averaging 16.3 ppg, 11.3 rpg, and 1.8 bpg shooting 63%. The wolves are 4-5 and the jazz 3-3 so far in March.

Not only are the Jazz competitive now, but they have what appears to be a young core, with lots of money on hand, and lots of picks.

162,"Why is Jokic's VORP so much higher than everybody else's? Not trying to be snarky, asking a genuine question.",11w18rg,"List of Top 10 VORP in the NBA - 

1.	Nikola Jokić • DEN	8.0
2.	Luka Dončić • DAL	6.0
3.	Joel Embiid • PHI	5.6
4.	Jimmy Butler • MIA	5.0

8.	Giannis Antetokounmpo • MIL	4.5
9.	Jayson Tatum • BOS	4.4
10.	Donovan Mitchell • CLE	4.4

There's gotta be some statistical trick that's inflating Jokic's numbers so much higher than everyone else's. Players from #2-10 have differences of about 0.3 between them, while Jokic has a whole 2.0 lead over Doncic (#2).

163,Anthony Davis since the trade deadline,11wgnef,"Without D’Angelo Russell in the lineup: 

5 games (3-2 record) 

33 PPG / 14 RPG on 21 FGA per game

With D’Angelo Russell in the lineup: 

9 games (6-3 record) 

19 PPG, 13 RPG on 15 FGA per game 

During the 2022-2023 season Anthony Davis is averaging 25.8 PPG on 17.2 FGA and 12.5 RPG in 46 games played. 

But it seems that he becomes very passive with D’Angelo Russell in the lineup. 

His PPG drops from 25.8 to 19. 

His FGA drop from 17.2 to 15. 

Is this because D’Angelo is not a true point guard, but more of a scoring guard? 

He doesn’t seem to have a good passing ability, but he shoots and scores well. 

I think he is a perfect fit next to LeBron and AD for spacing and scoring purposes, but he is detrimental to AD’s offensive game when he is the main ball handler.

If you take his stats without LeBron and D’Lo we can see why some consider him the top 10 player: 

His PPG increases up to 33 PPG and he takes 4-6 more shots per game. 

This is the Anthony Davis the Lakers need to make the playoffs. A 33 PPG monster who takes 20+ shots per game and grabs 15 rebounds. 

It’s sad to see him play like Kevon Looney so often.

Pg - Magic Johnson - magics passing would be a show to watch on its own. His length would makes up for steph being undersized. But steph is also excellent at playing off ball and would get a crazy amount of clean looks of magic.
Sg - Steph Curry - Curry is a player who excellent at playing off the ball and moving through picks that’s his game.
Sg - Micheal Jordan - MJ is there for ISO’s and taking over the game if needed
Pf - Kareem Abdul Jabbar - Adds another unguardable dimension with the sky hook. Kareem wins chips in highschool, college, and 6 nba rings? 
C - Shaquille O’Neil - Shaq would easily be one of the best screen setters which would open crazy looks for steph and better spacing for magic to move around. Shaq had a very high ball iq and a lot forget he was a great passer! If shaq could shot freethrows that alone would make him the best of all time.

Bench 
Dennis Rodman - every successful team needs hustle player. Hustle to players who do that do well on other stats besides scoring with first class defence at any position while having the ability to get into players heads to the point their playing bad is underrated with results! 
Robert Horry - last shot? Horry or Jordan nothing more to it! 
Hakeem Ojuwan - I think I picked all the players who revolutionized the game and the last one would be Hakeem. The footwork revolutionized the sport and players up to this days come to him for advice and we’re talking the kobies, and lbjs
Lebron James - Lbj can’t be left out. He’s better than curry yes but these pieces bring better chemistry.",Reasonable-Tour4147,20,6,0.61

179,"James Harden is 9th in the current MVP ladder, yet missed the All-Star team and will likely miss All-NBA as well. Is Harden having the greatest ""no award"" season in NBA history?",11xc5ku,"The [current MVP ladder](https://www.nba.com/news/kia-mvp-ladder-march-17-2023-edition) has James Harden sitting in 9th place.

Harden is averaging 22/11/6 on the team with the second best record in the league. Philly currently sits at 48-22.

While this would normally be a shoo-in for not just an All-Star selection but a juicy All-NBA team as well, Harden was snubbed from All Star team. He was passed up for the likes of:

* Jrue Holiday (19/7/5)
* Tyrese Haliburton (21/10/4)
* Pascal Siakam (24/8/5)
* Demar Derozan (25/5/5)

who all made the team despite either having significantly worse stats or playing on a significantly worse team, or both.

All-NBA teams are more selective than the All-Star team due to having 37.5% less spots, so it's highly unlikely Harden will be rewarded with an All-NBA spot either.

I scoured hundreds player stats across dozens of seasons to see if I could find another season similar to the one Harden's having now, where a player is elite yet didn't collect a single award.

The closest I could find was **Damian Lillard's 2017 season**. Dame averaged 27/6/5, but Portland went just 41-41 and barely squeaked into the postseason. I believe the difference in record pushes it in favor of 2023 Harden.

Is anyone aware of a better ""no award"" season than the one Harden is having right now?",MarshalMichelNey1,18,0,0.44

1 Steal = 5pts

We tend to cite “pace and space” as the reason for the league’s scoring spike, but that wouldn’t explain the recent jump in FT%. The league FT% has been fairly steady for decades but it’s spiked recently.

There could be several factors for this —

— teams are playing fewer “bigs,” who traditionally aren’t good free throw shooters. They’re also running the offense through the post less often, which may mean fewer FT attempts for the big dudes who are still there.

— the league-wide emphasis on shooting may mean the perimeter players (guards and forwards) are better shooters than the past. We don’t see many defensive specialists anymore, or even traditional point guards who aren’t shooters (like a Rajon Rondo type.)",ZandrickEllison,34,172,0.96

Joel Embiid had 31 pts on 10/15 shooting, 7 rebs, 7 asts, 2 blks, and 1 turnover without James Harden tonight. This is the 4th time in their last 7 games that he hasn't played in the 4th.

208,Who had a worse series in 2022: Tatum v GSW OR Durant v BOS,11wpv2r,"Both players struggled mighty in their respective series as both shot below 38% from the field (even though Tatum shot above 44% from 3 which makes no sense). That is probably the worst series of Durant’s career IMO.

Both players never really got it going or had shown glimpses of their potential, and effectively lost. Both also had 1 game where they were both below 20 points (KD G3, JT G6) and less than 5 FGM (JT G1 - 3/17, KD G2 - 4/17). 

They both mirrored each other in some psychotic way.

209,"Would the NBA Team That Drafts Wembanyama Have to Pay Metropolitans 92 a ""Transfer Fee"" just like Association Football (""Soccer"")?",11vw2sx,"I believe the Dallas Mavericks had to pay an undisclosed fee to Real Madrid AFTER drafting Luka Doncic, so this precedent for the NBA has been set before. However, I believe, Luka Doncic had a contract with Real Madrid at the time of the NBA draft. I do not know if this is the case with Wembanyama, however, I believe he would not have a contract running past this year as is the case given the elite level of preparation with training and agents constructed around him and advising he probably received to sign a short-term deal.

But, if Wembanyama is still under contract, would his drafting team have to pay a transfer fee to Metropolitans 92? This phenomenon is not unheard of in other European sports. For example, when Cristiano Ronaldo went from Manchester United to Real Madrid, Real Madrid paid his former club 80M euros. I don't think Wembanyama would command more than a few million, but I'm sure any NBA team would pay it if given the opportunity to draft him in the NBA player.",JJWhatWhat,21,25,0.78

214,"The Other, Other Guy: The Third ""Star"" of NBA Championship Teams",11w48r4,"PRELUDE: My method of determining the third best player on teams is absolutely terrible, but I'm sticking through- I took the third best player of each championship team by win shares and ranked them all- first of all, I don't necessarily agree with every take from win shares, and some of them CERTAINLY don't match up with popular consensus. Anyway, on to the overly pretentious opening. 

Of course, a championship team is anchored by its super star- you think of the Jordan Bulls, Magic Lakers, Lebron whatever team he's on. Sometimes, there's even a duo involved, be it Duncan and Robinson, James and Davis, or Jordan and Pippen! Then you have the third guy. The mythical big three calls to mind images of super teams, but how does EVERY championship team's third guy shape out? Do you need a star to fill the role? To explore this question, I ranked all 73 ""third"" players by win shares! To go with the regular season stat (winshares), also throwing in a few rudimentary stats from their playoff run that year! Who contributes more to winning? Another premier scorer or that rock solid glue guy?

227,What kind of contract could a player like Kenny Smith in his prime get in todays league?,11vx3p8,"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smithke01.html

Talking about Kenny Smith from Inside the NBA. While he was never a superstar level player, he put up decent numbers and would probably be a starting guard  on a lot of teams in his prime. Would constantly get above 40 percent from 3 point shooting too.  

He averaged 17.7 ppg, 7.1 ast and 2.1 rebounds in his best statistical year which was his 6th season.

He was also able to average a similar stat line his sophomore season. 

I feel like he would have had a massive contract if it was negotiated after his 4th or 6th season, just going off the consistency and potential.

Beyond the stat line he was able to co exist with a superstar player like Hakeem and was able to bring out the best in each other. Valuable trait to have for teams that built around a star.",Aktor56,20,18,0.77
228,(O.C.) All the players who've been the best player on a championship going back 1969,11vrl05,"I think this is one of the true lists in this sport. It happens quite often where the guy who won MVP seems like the best player in the league, but then it's the guy who brought home the ring who really gets that praise. Giannis for instance, after the playoff exit in 2020 was getting widely slammed despite being a back to back mvp but, upon winning the ring in 2021, he became the top dog. Only 5 active players have done that. and the list of active nba players who've been the best player on a finals team but not win the ring isn't too long either. (Tatum, Booker, Jimmy Butler, and if you want you can include Dwight Howard since he's technically still playing basketball).

So let's list them I'll put the first year they did it, which should help for multiple time winners. I'll be starting from the latest.

**Any miscalculations here**

Let me explain any ""controversial"" picks I made in the making of the list here.  I am putting David Robinson as the best player on the 1999 Spurs as Duncan was still young, but I genuinely am unsure and will trust a random spurs fan on here if they say otherwise. I also have heard that Joe Dumars was up there with Isiah Thomas for those late 80s Pistons teams. and I think you can make the point for either Ben Wallace or Chauncey Billups for the 04 Pistons.

Also, I should note that I put Magic's first year as the best player on the champion lakers as 82. I wasn't sure if there was a solid argument for Kareem that year. I know for a fact Kareem was better in 1980. I am also putting Moses Malone, not Dr J as the best player on philly in 1983.

I'm not an expert on 70s basketball. I had trouble finding much about the 1979 Sonics, but Dennis Johnson seemed to have the superior accolades. I may have overrated Dave Cowens and maybe should have put havlicek in 1974 but cowens was the mvp in 1973 and John was older at that time so I made some assumptions.  Also, because I'm stopping at 1969, players who lead their teams to victory before that year(namely, Wilt and Bill Russell) will be getting credit at the first point in the timeline.

&#x200B;

Hope that all makes sense.

**The Actual List**

&#x200B;

2021: Giannis

2019 Kawhi Leonard

2017: KD

2015: Steph Curry

2012: Lebron James

2011: Dirk

2009 Kobe

2008: Kevin Garnet

2006: D-Wade

2004: Ben Wallace or Chauncey Billups

2000: Shaq

1999: Tim Duncan

1994: Hakeem

1991: Michael Jordan

1989 Isiah Thomas

1983: Moses Malone

1982: Magic Johnson

1981: Larry Bird

1979: Dennis Johnson

1978: Wes Unseld(or Elvin Hayes OR Bob Dandridge) 

1977: Bill Walton

1975: Rick Barry

1974: Dave Cowens(or Havlicek)

1972: Wilt Chamberlain(or Jerry West?) 

1971: Kareem Abdul-Jabar

1970: Willis Reed

1969: Bill Russell.

Edits: took out David Robinson for 1999 and  Joe Dumars for 1989. added in some other options for several teams in the 70s.  thanks u/[**bonziwellsayo**](https://www.reddit.com/user/bonziwellsayo/)**,** for that suggestion.   
 

&#x200B;

In total, that's about 27 unique players over a 54 year span, with the 70s having the most names with 8  unique mvps. where as the 2000s(the second highest) had 6 unique MVPS and the 80s and 90s had only 4 unique MVPS.

&#x200B;

If you cut it off at 1980, you get a pretty even average of a new best player on a finals team emerging 5 times per decade. and it's been 2 years since Giannis did it for the first time. Maybe this is a sign a new player will do it this year?

&#x200B;

of the 27 players only 6 never won an MVP award. The ones who didn't are Kawhi Leonard, whoever you pick from the 04 Pistons, Isiah Thomas, Dennis Johnson, and Rick Barry.

&#x200B;

Players who HAVE won MVP but are not, as of right now, on that list: Nikola Jokic(2020-21-2021-22), James Harden(2017-18), Russell Westbrook(2016-17) , Steve Nash (2004-05, 2005-06), Allen Iverson(2000-01)  Karl Malone(1996-97, 1998-1999) David Robinson (1994-95), Charles Barkley(1992-1993) Julius Erving(1980-81) and Bob mcadoo(1974-75). Note though that Dr. J and David Robinson did win a ring as a top 2 option on the team, unlike others on this list so i don't think they should count in the same way. 

&#x200B;

In compiling this I used [this list of previous finals MVPS](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/finals_mvp.html) and cross referenced it with a list of mvps from the same source (bball ref), and would clarify with wikipedia and LandofBasketball to be sure i was picking the right guy.

233,Why don't NBA defenses defend Giannis the way they do Steph Curry?,11wyulu,"ok it sounds ridiculous but hear me out. 

In the recent analysis involving the play where Giannis trucks Craig, it's deemed that the defender is not in legal guarding position. But instead of defenders playing this game of trying to draw charges and and ""build a wall"", why not do the opposite? why not just stay inside his jersey the whole game and never let him build up momentum?

Giannis starts running from the opposite three point line, by the time he gets into the defenders space, you're cooked. But imagine instead a defender just stayed within a few feet of him the whole game and never let him comfortably start running, or recieve passes.

Giannis isn't a 3 level scorer, he's not going to hit you with step back 3s and elbow pull up middys. Hes not going to hit you with nasty crossovers and get to open space. Hes not going to take you to the block and hit you with dream shakes and turn around hooks off the glass. 
The defender doesn't even need to be elite, they just have to reasonably stay in front of Giannis and prevent him from comfortably building momentum. 

Idk the last 5 years of trying to build walls and draw charges has resulted in him giving you 40/15 every night.  Am I crazy to think it's time to try a different approach?",HitboxOfASnail,50,0,0.42

Road: 7-29

What do I even say anymore? They have the 3rd worst road record and the 3rd best home record.

Early in the season it could be written off as them simply having bad luck, or missing shots, etc. At this point is it fair to say these are essentially two different teams? If this is the case, without home court advantage in any series, what are the odds we see them bounced in the first round in 5-6? 

Furthermore, with the West play in race being so tight, it’s plausible they end up the 8 seed or worse the 9 seed and potentially have to play one of the games on the road. Many have already pencilled in the Warriors as a playoff team, but with a rough schedule and plenty of road games left, there’s absolutely no guarantee they stay afloat. 

All this to say, if the Warriors miss the playoffs, or they get bounced early in an uncompetitive series, will we see this core broken up in the offseason?",william4534,52,367,0.95

After tonights win, the Sacramento Kings are only 4 games behind from the #1 Seed Nuggets in the East, with the final game of the season being Kings vs Nuggets on April 9th. Could Could the Kings win the West?

It certainly seems possible when we look at the remaining schedule for both teams.

Kings play:

* Jazz x 2
* Suns
* TWolves
* Trail Blazers x 2
* Pelicans
* Warriors
* Celtics
* Spurs
* Mavs
* Nuggets

The Nuggets play:

* Wizards
* 76ers
* Suns x 2
* Rockets
* Jazz
* Nets
* Bucks
* Pelicans
* Warriors

The Nuggets Strength of schedule is: .529. (source: [https://www.tankathon.com/remaining\_schedule\_strength](https://www.tankathon.com/remaining_schedule_strength))

It may very well come down to the final game of the season where the Kings have the chance to end the season with a BEAM and #1 Seed. The Kings need to win 3 more games than the Nuggets and then beat them in the final game of the season to achieve this (with about 10 games remaining to do so outside of the final game).",6lackDino,41,135,0.92

248,How Do We Know Ownership Won't Make The LakerS Front Office Choose Between Reaves And D'Lo This Offseason?,11wsvot,"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10030461-how-la-lakers-mismanaged-their-way-from-champs-to-chumps
> Had L.A. paid Nunn a slightly lower figure in his first year (just $35,258 less), it could have used the remainder to sign undrafted rookie Austin Reaves to a three-year contract starting at $925,258, instead of a two-year minimum deal for the promising rookie.
        
Here's an article *today*: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-austin-reaves-is-making-a-leap-but-gilbert-arenas-rule-may-make-it-hard-for-la-to-pay-him-for-it/
    
So there you have it, Reaves wouldn't even be a RFA this offseason looking at a payday if LAL's front office had bothered to do their homework *after flunking it the first two times* with Caruso and THT. To be clear, the Lakers aren't the only team to screw this particular facet up (looking at you Chicago with Ayo), but it's so telling that it's such a repeating pattern. OKC got this right with Lu Dort. The Clippers did the same thing with Terrance Mann. The Pelicans' Front Office gets a lot of flack, but they nailed it *three times* between Naji Marshall, Herb Jones, and Jose Alvarado.  IF a player from outside the first-round is good enough to make the roster, he's good enough to get a 3+ year deal. What's the worst case scenario? He turns out to be as unplayable at the NBA level as plenty of other end-of-bench guys?
      
Correct if I'm wrong, but the last four players to play three years  *on the same contract* for the Lakers are: Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, and Julius Randle.  While Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker both played 3+ seasons, it came over the course of multiple 2-year ocntracts. Contrary to popular belief, it wasn't the Westbrook trade that cost the Lakers Caruso, it was not signing either him or THT to a 3-year rookie deal. Either contract would have put most of Caruso's cost for at least the 21-22 season under the luxury tax.   
    
Right now the Lakers are enjoying a strong 2nd half of the season, because Reaves on his current salary figure is helping to maximize the salary to production output ratio, but given the history of this front office (and the signing off by ownership) of not committing to anybody other than super stars to longer than two years, how likely is that both come back? Especially if there's any hitch with Dallas retaining Kyrie? Even if you  retaun D'Lo *at 60%*, the reported offers for Reaves with D'Lo would still put LAL too close to the luxury tax for auxulliary moves.
      
Feel free to correct any fault in my reasoning. Maybe that's why Pelinka wasn't very eager to part ways with 1sts until such a near slam dunk deal came through the pipeline.",AnotherStatsGuy,30,0,0.45

Clippers - Suns in round 1 

Knicks and Cavaliers in round 1 

Seeing if any of the Warriors/Mavericks/ Lakers can get to round 1 and upset the Kings, Grizzlies or even the Nuggets. 

Seeing Embiid win the MVP and the Championship. Outside of the Lakers, the 76ers would be the team I want to win the most. 

If Embiid and Harden manage to win a ring with the 76ers - this would be enormous for their legacies and the city of Philadelphia. 

Can’t for the playoffs.

262,Who is the worst NBA player that could lead the 16th seed to a March Madness Championship?,11wq17r,"Who is the worst player in the NBA that could lead a 16th seed to a March Madness Championship?

I saw this question on Twitter and wanted Reddit’s opinion. This is also a gauge in the difference in ability from college to NBA.

I think we can cross off MVP level players, I firmly believe Giannis/Jokic could lead the “scrubs” to the ring. 

On the other hand is it outrageous to say role players couldn’t achieve this? Maybe it’s dependent on position, I don’t think back up point guards such as Caruso or Ish Smith could overcome the difference in talent between 16th seed and elite teams. 

So it begs the question what type of talent is the bare minimum needed to overcome the odds. 


Things to consider: 
- Shorter 3 Point Line
- Does it have to be a big man to help with defensive issues the team would have?
- Paolo Banchero couldn’t lead duke to the championship and he was the number 1 pick.
- They’re players in college right now better than some NBA players.",SpaceFluffy,108,0,0.41

288,"De'Aaron ""I'm F**king Nice"" Fox - Game Icing Stats (with video)",11uw3oo,"We've all seen Fox's excellent 4th quarter and clutch time stats, but I was curious: how many times this year has he been the one to actually ice the game?

I have a bunch of grading and lesson planning to do, so instead I just spent an hour going back through game logs and highlight videos.

I looked at two categories:

* Fox Game Winners - Fox scores the go-ahead bucket, and that is the final points of the game (I kinda cheated on this for a couple of them). I also looked to see how many of these were buzzer-beaters.
* Fox Daggers - I defined these as any game where Fox hit the Kings' final field goal, followed by some Kings FTs because of intentional fouling.

Here are the results:

The King have won 26 games by a single digit margin this year. In those games...

Fox has **7 game winners** (again two are a slight stretch but I'm counting them), a whopping four (!!) of which were buzzer beaters. 

* 11/5 @ Orlando, he hits the [unforgettable logo buzzer-beater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu1OZ4M6Cjc) to win it 126-123
* 12/14 @ Toronto, he drives to the rim and draws the foul with 0:05, and goes 1-2 to put the Kings up 3. On the next possession Siakim hits the putback after a missed FVV three, so this one is kinda cheating, but Kings don't win in regulation without that free throw.
* 1/3 @ Utah, [he hits the driving layup as time expires](https://youtu.be/tKXRDPZijNs?t=435) (call on the floor was that he didn't get it off in time, overturned on review) to win 117-115 (this is after Markkanen draws the 3 shot foul with 16 seconds to go and hits all three to tie)
* 2/8 @ Houston, [he draws the three shot foul from *Eric Gordon as time expires and hits all three](https://youtu.be/qaSTT5rsxqM?t=409), to win 130-128
* 2/11 vs. Dallas, he gets to the FT line three times in the last 18 seconds of OT, going 6/6 to win 133-128 (you could call this a bit of a stretch, but the Kings needed every single one of those six points)
* 2/24 @ LAC [he hits the go-ahead 2-point pullup jumper at 0:36 in 2OT](https://youtu.be/IUqEYXRn4HA?t=445), after creating that possession by picking Mason Plumlee's pocket. These are the last points of the game. Honorable mention for [assisting Monk's insane game-tying 3](https://youtu.be/bWc_-_DIFXA?t=105) to force OT in the first place. Kings win 176-175
* And of course, just the other night in Chicago, he [pulls up for an ice cold 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBA0ZhkLc1E) as the buzzer sounds to win 117-114.

The thing that really stands out to me: 6/7 game winners are on the road, a huge reason for the Kings' conference best road record of 21-13.

In addition to the 7 game-winners, he hit another 3 daggers, which I define as times where he hit the Kings' final FG of the win, followed only by Kings FTs on intentional fouls.

* 11/11 @ LAL, he [drains a turnaround fadeaway 2](https://youtu.be/1CQTw5I1qz0?t=432) with 0:32 to go
* 11/20 vs. Detroit, [he hits the two-point stepback](https://youtu.be/pMKX1-7jqa4?t=422) with 0:56 to go
* 1/20 vs. OKC, [he hit a layup to ice the game at 0:01](https://youtu.be/WMwjbMqEdls?t=437) (the Kings were already up 3 at the time, but it ended a flurry of OKC scoring)

Honorable mention for [assisting Trey Lyle's game-sealing dunk](https://youtu.be/cmhnaZDiwC8?t=561) with 0:37 to go @ Minnesota on 1/30.

Those are the only PGs I could take over Trae. I honestly don’t see an argument for Ja, Fox, Garland, or Hali, just because Trae had a rough start to this season. 

27 and 10 on good efficiency doesn’t just grow on trees and Trae has basically been doing that since his 2nd year at 20 years old, and now he’s playing solid defense too. 

With Quin Snyder as his new coach, he’s 
27/4/9 on 48/41/90 so far after 9 games. 

And obviously we’ll see what happens in the playoffs but as long as the Hawks aren’t facing the Heat, even if they lose in round 1 I think Trae will bounce back from his performance last year. 

Next year we could see an MVP-like breakout season from Trae…

- Potential Miami/Boston rematch from last years ECF 

- Potential Toronto/Philly rematch from last year (or Toronto/Boston from the bubble) 

In the West there’s GS, Minnesota, OKC and Utah. 

- I personally want to see OKC play GS to see how Shai and their young team reacts to a heavily experienced playoff team (and reigning champs) 

- Warriors in the first round against Denver could have major upset potential and add to the list of 1-seed collapses.

296,Best Starting Lineup of 2-Way Players?,11vp2v4,"2-way players are my favorite to watch because there really aren't that many in the league, most players specialize in one side of the ball or the other. So that got me thinking about who the best starting 5 of elite 2-way players would be. I think the four locks are Jrue Holiday, Kawhi, Giannis, and Embiid. For the second guard, I think I'd lean toward Mikal Bridges right now, but Paul George would be a fine answer too. Idk I'm bored what do u guys think?",DJFunkenstein69,43,4,0.63
297,Why do people think Steph and KD have declined?,11whyw3,"For the past year I've been seeing people saying that these 2 have declined. Sometimes it's outright explicitly saying it and sometimes it's putting players like Giannis or Jokic over 2 guys whose peaks are top 15 all time at the very least. I just want to know why people think these 2 have declined. 

In 2021, these guys were top 3 locks according to everybody. Both had arguments for best in the world with Lebron's decline that year. Steph had his best or second best regular season that year while KD showed that while he had changed, he was still at least as good as he was in OKC/GS. KD was pretty much the consensus best player after the Bucks series that year(which I thought was undeserved because Steph and Harden both outperformed KD in the RS and didn't really get to show out in the playoffs to sway the public). Last year KD looked just as good while Steph started the season on an absolute tear. They were the leading MVP candidates and people said that they were better than ever. KD ended up missing too many games while Steph went on a months long slump after Thanksgiving that was clearly unrelated to his body declining. Steph ended up breaking out of his slump became a monster in the playoffs as usual and won a ring+FMVP. KD had a bad first round series, but that was clearly due to factors outside of his control like Ben Simmons' salary not playing and Kyrie not showing up while KD was getting swarmed by the Cs. KD has proved this season that he's still the same player though and both of these guys are putting up some of the best stats of their career, even when adjusted for pace and efficiency. Watching them, I legit don't see any difference between 2023 and 2021. 

While I can see how KD's less varied and more specialized shot selection can turn off some people, I don't get how that doesn't make him even better seeing as how his midrange jumper is wetter than ever. His defense is back to GS level despite having less help too. Additionally, even if we ignore all context in last year's playoffs, 4 games doesn't compare to the 35-50ish RS games he's played each year since 2020-21, many of which featured KD coasting due to age and recent injuries. 

On the other hand, there's absolutely no argument for Steph being any worse than he was at his peak. Statswise, he's been pretty consistent with his past seasons. Going off the eye test, he's better than he was in the early dynasty years due to his added strength and improved defense and virtually identical to 2021. Like KD, he's had random contact injuries this year, but Steph has never been the epitome of good health and his injuries haven't slowed him down one bit. 

How are these guys not the consensus #1 and #2 in the league? Do people not watch their games anymore? These guys have adapted their games like Lebron did in his second Cavs stint to become better than ever. Saying that anybody else is close to these 2 is straight up disrespectful.",NotUrAvgShitposter,36,0,0.34

2021-22: Suns had a +7.5, Celtics had +7.3, and Warriors had +6.5.

This year: Zero teams above +6.0, and only two teams above +5.0 -- the Cavs at +5.6 and the Celtics at +5.4.

What do we think is the reason for this? League-wide parity? A lack of great teams or bottom teams? Interested to hear what people think.

322,is it legal to offer a upper mid tier free agent a huge one year contract (well worth their value) with the caveat of signing a minimum the next year?,11vcap8,"



Let’s say your team (mid/large market) has a summer where a max slot (however it may cost in any given year) frees up, but no big stars are available, but, the next year - multiple top 5 players are - however, there are quite a few decent starters (like we’re talking B- to C tier dudes who are great contributes, think of guys worth 10/20 mil, for example. These guys can’t lead a team, but they’re very solid contributors. However, if you sign them to multi year deals - you lose out on your max slot. 


Now, what i want to ask if the following would be legal:

Let’s say you offer two of these players, who are normally worth 10-20mil each a huge one year contract. Ex. Two one year 30mil to them, and mention that they intend to sign a big star the next year, however, if you wish to win the championship, you must sign the minimum the next season. You don’t have to sign, you can even turn this down if another team pays you more, but just know that this is the only condition i would have to give you this large overpay for one year. 


Is such a thing legal? or would it count as tampering? you’re not giving them money under the table per say, you also aren’t making them commit to the min the next year and are basically giving the player to go to another team in the next summer if they so wish.

Unfortunately, starting in the 2018-19 season he went from a good shooter to mediocre. From 2015-16 to 2017-18 he shot 38.9% from 3, but could not reach 38% in any season out of his next 3. In those next 3 seasons he shot 33.7% from 3 and lost a lot of his value as a player. Now though, he looks like he may have found his shot again. In the last 2 seasons he is shooting 39.9% in 100 games. He’s been above 38% in both seasons and this season he is at 42.5%.

Just to be clear, I don’t think the 3 point shot is the only reason Gary Harris fell off the map. He’s dealt with a lot of injuries and his 2p% also fell off. However, I do think he can be a useful player in a good team’s rotation if he continues to shoot like this.

AD 44% LeBron 88%

&#x200B;

AD is much better freethrow shooter than Lebron, but somehow AD is atrocious from clutch freethrow line, while Lebron has been nearly 90% freethrow shooter despite the criticism that he gets",junahn,21,24,0.78
329,Quietly Jrue Holiday has become the all-time leader in blocks for a Point Guard with 453,11tui6d,"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/holidjr01.html

https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kiddja01.html

Jason Kidd was formerly first place with 450.

https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/walljo01.html

John Wall is the other active player that is sniffing around Jrue at 439.

Jrue is also top 25 in blocks for a guard. Even as a Bucks fan, I don't know that I appreciate how good his defense is. If he plays for another 4-5 years he'll be in the top 25 of all players in steals. About 20/25 of those players are in the hall of fame.

Where is Jrue on the list of defensive point guards in the last 20-30 years?",wirsteve,399,4996,0.98

340,Worst award winning seasons from players in the last 25 years,11v16rw,"Who is the worst player to win each award in the span of 1998-2022? And I don't mean worst player in terms of career but worst seasons to win every major award. If you think 25 years is going too far back I'll try to include modern examples. Awards/honors to be omitted from this are all-defensive team, all-rookie team, stat leader titles like steals leader, all the character/community work awards, and All-Star Game MVP (b/c nobody gives a shit in the ASG)

Final disclaimer, **I'm not saying any of these players are bad because that's dumb to say that, I'm just comparing it to all other winners of the same award**

_______________________________

**MVP** - Karl Malone 98-99

This was the worst season in the given time frame pretty easily, MJ retired, lockout shortened, pace was slow as hell, no star player really stood out or had that great of a year. They had to give it to someone so they chose Malone. What's funny about this one is that Karl Malone's numbers were down than years prior, like this was his 10th highest season in PPG pretty sure. Other candidates would be Iverson in 01, Rose in 11, Nash in 05, Curry in 15 was kinda weak. Again great seasons but keep in mind it's compared to other MVPs

**FMVP** - Andre Iguodala 14-15

Not saying the man didn't deserve the award but come on, he was given it for being the most effective at stopping Lebron even though he still put up 36/13/9. Let's be honest, either Lebron or Steph should have won

**DPOY** - Marcus Camby 06-07

Should have been Duncan's, Camby is also the only retired DPOY never to be an all-star in his career. Other answers for this, and both of these will get shit, Kawhi's second DPOY in 2016 which should have been Draymond's, and Marcus Smart in 2022 which was questionable to say the least. I mean come on Gobert and Giannis were better defenders and he wasn't even the best defender on the team last finals (timelord)

**Sixth Man** - Jamal Crawford 2015-16

This one stuck out to me because 35 year old Crawford was absolutely not a better 6th man than someone like Iguodala. Not that it really matters but it was purely a reputation award or a name they associate with the trophy. Pretty sure he won it over Ginobili in another year too

**ROY** - Mike Miller 00/01

Respect to Mike Miller and everything but that draft was straight booty cheeks and Miller would average 12/4/2 on 29 minutes. But then again there is Malcolm Brogdon with 10/3/4 on 26 minutes in 2016-17, honestly take your pick

**Hustle Award** - Amir Johnson 17-18

Dumbass award lol but why Amir Johnson? I don't think even 6ers fans know

**Most Improved Player** - Alan Henderson 97-98

I'll be honest, I don't know who this guy is. He put up 14/6/1 and played for the Hawks. You can maybe say Monte Ellis in 06-07 putting up 17/3/4 on the Baron Davis Warriors. idk

**All-NBA First Team** - DeAndre Jordan 15-16

Another tough one because of course there wont be any bad players here but it's gotta be him or Marc Gasol in 14-15. DeAndre Jordan was a great player, one of the best defenders in the league (behind Draymond and Kawhi at that time but still), elite rebounder, elite rim protector, great at setting screens, highest FG% and efficiency at that time. But let's face it, it was a weak era for centers. People will say Joakim Noah but I remember each of these years and I'd put him ahead of DAJ or Gasol

**All-NBA Second Team** - Vin Baker 97-98

Baker was playing for the Sonics and was putting up 19/8/2, of course it was a great season but he was 11th in scoring and was competing with Shaq, Robinson, Webber, Mutombo, etc... at the same position. Maybe I'm being biased towards big names though in this case. Modern example? Uhhhhh... Julius Randle 2 years ago? Maybe Siakam in 2020. Again it's hard to say and I'm not trying to hate on these guys or anything, someone who knows more should comment if I'm off base

**All NBA-Third Team** - Eddie Jones 99-00

Put up 20/4/5 on the Hornets. Marbury the same year put up 22/3/8 on a bad Nets team, pretty empty stats. As you can gather it wasn't the strongest era for NBA talent. But modern examples again? Maybe Bogut in 2010, David Lee in 2013, Shaq in 2009

I don't really feel like doing all-defensive teams very much since I don't know how to judge defensive ability or whatever criteria. Knowing about different basketball players than your team was different up until 10 or so years ago because cable TV is all you had. Same for all-rookie teams, there isn't a way to compare players without it taking all day basically so I'll skip them. But here are some bonus awards for non-players:

**Coach of the Year**- Sam Mitchell 06-07

He was the coach of the Raptors who went 47-35 to make 3rd in conference that year, it was his only winning season on not that good of a team. Speaking of Raps coaches, Dwane Casey 17-18 is probably #2 for worst

**Executive of the Year** - Elgin Baylor 05-06

This one is tough because it was probably seen as a great year (47-35, 6th in conference) but Baylor is not fondly remembered as Clippers GM. They would go back to being >.500 the year after and he had only 2 winning seasons in 10 years, but the worst owner in NBA history was running the organization so how much can you blame Elgin. Other candidates are Masai Ujiri in for the 2013 Nuggets, great season but Morey should have won

**Western Conference Champion**: 2006 Mavericks

The West wins the title most of the time, it's crazy looking at finalists considering 16/25 have won and those who didn't were mostly repeat finalists. But I go with 06 Mavs for this one because of a comparably mediocre roster around Dirk and Dirk was still in his choker days. I'll talk more about this finals later but they were the worst interior D the Heat had faced and they didn't double Wade. But other acceptable answers for this are the 04 Lakers for being washed/chemistry issues, or 2021 Suns for last 10 years

**Eastern Conference Champion**: 2002 Nets

Honestly chose your pick between that or the 03 Nets, the East was just complete garbage and either team probably loses in the first round if they were in the West. In 03 they made it to the finals with a piping hot 49-33 record and they were coached by Byron Scott. Other answers for this would be 01 Sixers, 07 Cavs, 20 Heat

**NBA Champion** - 2006 Miami Heat

Ignoring all the controversy with the refs/calls in the final, this isn't that great of a roster. Sure you had Wade at his best and Shaq in his last prime year (put up 14/10/3 in the finals series however) but Haslem, Jason Williams, and Antoine Walker were the starters and washed up Zo, GP, Derek Anderson were depth. SVG was also fired 20 games in. It really is a shame how people will overlook Wade turning into MJ by going 35/8/4 because ""it was rigged"" despite it being a top 5 finals performance ever",lowercase-punishment,26,15,0.72

356,"Yesterday, a Phoenix Suns podcast host gifted a pair of tickets to a mother who’s son had been bullied out of school. The Suns organization pulled out all the stops and gave him a night to remember.",11u00u5,"@AndrewLeezus is the host of the Everyday is Sunday podcast. Andrew gifted the tickets to Mrs, Devona (@DevNa79) who’s son, Shawn, had been bullied so bad that they had pulled him from school. 

I’m not sure how everything exactly went down from there, but it appears Andrew worked behind the scenes to get Shawn and his mother court side access before the game where Shawn met Devin Booker. After the game, he got to meet Suns owner, Matt Ishbia, and more of the Suns players, and was given an autographed pair of game worn shoes by CP3.

Why is this? Lauri Markkanen is on it while averaging similar numbers but being 10th in the West. James Harden is 8th on the ladder while being the 2nd star on the 76ers.

362,"It almost seemed as if Jokic's insane stats were becoming old and boring until the Nuggets went on a 4 game losing streak. If the Nuggets recover and maintain the first seed, & Jokic goes back to dominating like he was, could the little slump have unintuitively helped Jokic's MVP chances?",11w7d6r,"It almost seemed as if Jokic's dominance was becoming stale, and we had more or less stopped talking about him. It wasn't until this 4 game slump that everyone is considering the idea that maybe Jokic isn't as good as we thought he was. Maybe he isn't invincible! He can be stopped!

But if he shuts everyone up and ends the season absolutely dominating with a 70%+ win record, the 25/12/10 he had going, do you think it might actually benefit him? Because there was no narrative for Jokic to shoot-down before, it was simply, ""He's really good and its getting boring, but Giannis is going on a 15+ game win steak, and Embiid is healthy and his numbers are becoming historic."" Giannis and Joel were becoming the talk of the town.

Now, with a new found purpose to prove himself to the critics in the closing of the season, has Jokic revived excitement about him winning MVP? Is he better off this way?",aged_monkey,74,0,0.32

Luka has not played in the 4 games since then. Kyrie has also missed 3 of those 4 games. We lost to the Grizzlies twice (after which many Mavs fans thought our season was over), beat the Spurs in overtime after trying our hardest to lose, and beat the Lakers off a miracle game-winner.

Yet somehow, the Mavs *gained* ground in the playoff race. We're now 6th in the West thanks to the Warriors going 2-3 since then and the Wolves going 1-3.

364,Is the Western Conference the Most Unpredictable Conference Ever?,11utqg8,"As the title reads.

It's March 18th. I have no idea who makes the Finals.

If KD is healthy, I'd says PHX would be my favorite. But, ""KD"" and ""health"" have an increasingly bad relationship. And it's well looking like PHX will have to face the #1 team from the West that they don't want to play even with KD healthy - LAC - in the first round.

A lot will depend on matchups. Would I place money on Denver or SAC beating a healthy Lakers or Warriors team in the first round? Hell no. At the same time, either of those teams could luck into facing Minnesota or OKC in the first round.

Make all the jokes you want about depending on Kyrie, but Luka dragged the Mavs to the WCF just last year. If Kyrie wants to play, he's supremely talented. And guarding Luka and Kyrie in a seven-game series would be exhausting.",2020IsANightmare,22,11,0.65

373,Alex Caruso’s Defensive RAPTOR is the highest by a guard since the stat has been tracked,11umco0,"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Alex%20Caruso&season=2023

This season, Caruso’s DRAPTOR is +5.9, by far the highest in the league. The next closest is Anthony Davis at +5.2. 

Over the last nine seasons (the lifetime of the stat), only 3 guards crack the Top 30. 

Alex Caruso’s current season ranks 1st All-Time for guards, and 5th All-Time for all positions (1st and 2nd All-Time belong to Rudy Gobert) 

2nd place All-Time for guards again goes to Alex Caruso for the 2021-2022 season. 

3rd All-Time, and the only other guard in the Top 30 in DRAPTOR, is Tony Allen in the 2014-2015 season. Tony Allen was 33 at the time, so imo it’s very likely both him and Kobe Bryant would be the other guards near Caruso’s level if the stat covered all of the 2000s.

**Were there ever any bigger combined contributions of left-handed players to a single team?**

\- The closest I can come across in my head is the [2004-2005 Raptors](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2005.html) with Chris Bosh, Jalen Rose, Morris Peterson & Aaron Williams.

\- As well as, the [2015-2016](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIA/2016.html) Heat with Chris Bosh, McRoberts (I liked to shoot with him in 2K, dunno why), Justice Winslow, Goran Dragic, Beno Udrich & Tyler Johnson.

Both teams aren't even close (Heat is 51.9 PPG together - over 20 points away, but a low total too).

I also remember the [Memphis Grizzlies](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MEM/2011.html) with Zach Randolph, Mike Conley, and Xabier Henry.

**Were there ever two left-handed players in a single team averaging 20+ PPG in the past?**

**The Knicks are pretty close to having three left-handed players who averaged 20+ PPG (Barrett 19.8 PPG, Randle 25.2 PPG & Brunson 23.8 PPG).**

And yes, I'm lefty (but in the field of science, not sports).

380,The Denver Nuggets might need to trade Jamal Murray,11vz652,"BEFORE YOU RESPOND, please just read the post first because the title is not what you might assume!!!


Nikola Jokic is making the Nuggets look a lot better than they really are, and if they want to have any shot at winning the championship, they need to get some more pieces around Jokic. 


However, looking at their salary situation, that is going to be a problem. Denver is currently $35 million over the salary cap, and they may very well have the worst contract in the NBA right now with Michael Porter Jr. Right now he’s in the first year of a 5 yr/$180mil deal that he’s on until the end of the 2027 season. I say this because while he’s an elite shooter, he provides little to no value in just about every other aspect of the game. He’s an adequate rebounder, maybe, but he’s a cone on defense and provides zero playmaking ability. He’s essentially a black hole on offense and a non factor on defense, and he’ll be making $180 million through 2027. I didn't even mention him being injury prone too. Not great.


Now if we take a look at their other pieces, the players that fit well with Jokic that Denver should absolutely not look to trade (if they can avoid it) are Aaron Gordon, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Bruce Brown. They all provide defensive value, can stretch the floor, and don’t need the ball in their hands to be effective. Outside of those 3 guys, the only tradeable pieces of some value that Denver has are Jeff Green, Ish Smith, Thomas Bryant, Zeke Nnaji… not really enough to get Jokic any legitimate help.


Now Denver obviously could package either 2 or 3 of the aforementioned players (Gordon, Brown, KCP) in order to find another star to pair with Jokic, but that would gut their defense and depth even further than it already is. And since the MPJ contract is one that I don’t think any other GM would be willing to touch, and Denver can’t do anything in free agency in terms of really bringing Jokic more help, Jamal Murray seems to be the odd man out here.


Murray had a great run in the 2020 bubble, but outside of then he’s mostly just been looking like an above average starting combo guard. He can create well enough for himself off the dribble, shoot pretty well, and provides some playmaking value, which could make him an enticing option for some teams, although the $160mil contract he’s currently on isn’t exactly team friendly either. I haven’t gone through a rundown of every team to find the one(s) that would bring back the most value, or that would even accept a trade for Murray, but given Denver’s options if they want to compete for and win a championship, it seems like pretty much the only way that they can go. Do you guys agree?


TLDR: Denver is in contract hell with the shitty MPJ contract and they’re way over the cap so they can’t do anything to get Jokic more help in FA, so presumably the only way they can get Jokic more help to compete for a title w/o gutting their defense and depth is trading Jamal Murray.",C-DogDriver,72,0,0.32

1) Consistency- They need to call the game according to the RULES. They called a travel on a Curry stepback yesterday that they rarely ever call. Its like the ref decided he didn't like Curry for one play. These players routinely travel and carry and the refs call it at their leisure. Gotta stop.

I'd like to test out one post here and see if you guys enjoy some in-depth analysis.

# Highlight of Game

Thankfully the Raptors made this one easy today:

[As Scottie is crossing the half you see him take a look back at Yak to signal to him to hustle up the floor. From the block to the no-look to the poster, this play felt like the Showtime Lakers.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/q1irc2keqboa1/player)

# Player of the Game 

I've been Pascal Siakam's biggest critic since the deadline, as he's had **4 games** where he's **scored 15 or less points** in March**,** having only 3 such games before this month.

He finally did a good job at reading the help defense, finishing with **25/14/8** with **4 threes.** Since the Raptors have been fully healthy, Siakam is the only starter with a **negative NET RTG.** He was a **+6** last night, playing a healthy **34 minutes** and being tagged with the responsibility of leading the bench. 

I had to give today's player of the game to **Pascal Siakam**. He needed this game, and I hope he's able to string along some good performances as we close the season out (or not and we win Wemby).

# How the game was put away

I thought the Raptors were always always in control of this game, holding a **9 point lead** until the **8 minute mark** of the 4th, where Scottie Barnes subbed back in and we simply put away the game, here are some plays that I thought contributed to it:

[Isaiah Joe tries to blow by Gary Trent Jr Twice, fails and takes a contested jumper.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/2ury9envtboa1/player)

I made a point that whether or not his offence is going, Gary needs to stay aggressive and effective defensively. The first time Joe drives Scottie is there to help in the paint while constantly looking at Giddey. This play also shows the presence of Yak presence defensively, the second time that Joe tried to drive, Poeltl sagged off his player to help Trent if Joe wanted to finish at the rim. 

When defended by Poeltl, attacking players shoot **37.6%** between **5-9 feet** so Joe technically did take a better shot, but this is still perfect defense by Trent Jr. Additionally, Poeltl contested a team-high **18 shots** and held opponents to a crazy **7/24** when defended by him.

[Scottie does a great job of recognizing the mismatch and sealing Shai down-low, if he postered Vucevic, I'm sorry Lu Dort you're getting postered too. ](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/xzwhf0lbwboa1/player)

Reddit only allows me 5 videos, so let me break this one down step-by-step:

* Scottie grabs and offensive rebound, gets the switch from Giddey to Shai
* Once Siakam gets the ball, they do a great job of moving the ball (and the Thunder do a great job rotating) to force the Thunder into more mismatches. 
* Both Fred and Gary had good shots that they usually take, but instead they find Poeltl on single coverage
* Scottie cuts to the basket, seals Shai (ref misses a foul with Shai wrapping his arms around Scottie)
* Easy dunk over Dort.

[Transition 3 and that's good night folks.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/9i73jlnuyboa1/player)

The Raptors get criticized a lot for help defense, deservedly so, but this is a perfect example of knowing when to help, and I want you to pay attention to Scottie Barnes' eyes defensively. As soon as Dort makes the pass his focus is on what Giddey is going to create.

Scottie realizes that Giddey has his head down and can only see the left side of the court, and comes over from the to help immediately. When Giddey spins, there's a surprise waiting for him. 

4 Thunder players collapse on Siakam in transition, and instead of forcing contact and trying to draw a foul, he uses the space to find Trent Jr , who shoots **40%** on **wide-open** **threes.**

These were the 3 plays that I thought put the game away but here are some other **4th quarter notes**:

* The Raptors held the Thunder to **0 field goals** for over a **4-minute stretch**
* We were **+7 on the glass** and **+16% shooting from the field** compared to them
* Siakam didn't force, he had **5 assists, 0 turnovers,** and only took **3 shots**
* Scottie and Poeltl dominated with **16/10/2** with **2 stocks**

# The Good, The Bad, No Ugly

I usually do 3 good things, 3 bad things, one ugly thing. But yesterday was genuinely one of the best games I've seen this team play and I really can't think of many bad things.

**5 Good Things**

1. Everyone chipped in. In 2020, the Raptors became the first team to have **5 or more players** average **15+ PPG** in a season. Well they did it again last year, and they're doing it again this year. They also did it last night, but instead had **6 players** who scored **15 points** or more. Poeltl has been averaging just under **15PPG** with the Raptors this year, so maybe they could become the first (?) team do have 6 players do it.
2. Nick Nurse did a great job of splitting Siakam and Scottie's minutes, which is something I know fans have been calling for. This season, they average over **29 MPG** together**,** and yesterday they only played **21 minutes** together, partly due to foul trouble with OG and Poeltl (it would've been closer to 17 minutes). Regardless I think it's key to split their minutes for spacing, specifically in single coverage isolations.
3. The Raptors are **2-0** since I've added the keys to the game section (I'll elaborate lol). After the game vs Denver I said the matchup between Scottie and OG vs Giddey and JDub  (Thunder fans, I absolutely love him, he's just about as good as OG was last year, be excited) is key. Scottie and OG: **37/12/7/1TO** on **14/24** from the **field,** **5 stocks** and a **+14** on the floor together. Giddey and JDub: **28/14/4/5TO** on **10/22** from the **field, 2 stocks,** and a **-9** on the floor together. All these players are awesome, and these two-man pairings will be key to these teams future success.
4. The Raptors dominated them on the glass and in transition. Outrebounding them by **20**, with **44 points in transition vs 19** for the Thunder. In addition **23 2nd chance PTs** to their **6.**
5. Scottie Barnes has absolutely been a mid-range monster in the Month of March, just take a look at his [shot chart](https://twitter.com/6ixin6ix_/status/1636753803822153728?s=46&t=qyM1qIw-Y3F7679x-MiQOw&fbclid=IwAR0tn_ZH0-htq3rCFnXDJYoKv9Dph5Le3PcCAP5GbNT5lL-oDZDzlo7PKaA). Here's a look at why he's dominating that right side mid-range:

[Please excuse the quality.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/jqtcqqwwbcoa1/player)

His length is problematic. Teams are used to him getting into the paint and going for a hook shot or fadeaway (like he did against Giddey in this clip) and they usually send help as he's been shooting **46%** on those shots from the free throw line range. His ability to create shots on islands where teams can't really help (without giving up a high quality shot off a pass) is going to be important for his offensive developments because teams can't double him on island iso's because of his playmaking ability.

**1 Bad Thing**

# One Sentence Review, One Sentence Preview

# 3 Keys to Minnesota 

1. Attack Rudy Gobert off mismatches. Opposing teams shoot **56%** in the paint against him (both RA and non-RA). Against the Thunder I said managing the two-man game between Poeltl and whoever is running the PnR is important. We outscored The Thunder **30-10** on **points off screens.**
2. More Christian Koloko. He has the Raptors highest **NET RTG** this year, and it always confused me why Nick removed him from the rotation when he was our only center. I think placing him in a backup role where he can keep the defensive intensity that Poeltl brings is key going forward. He contested **7 shots** in only **12 minutes** yesterday.
3. Contain the two-man game of Conley and Gobert through effective switching and help. In wins the two of them combine for **30 PPG shooting 60% from the field.**  Whereas in losses they combine for **21 PPG shooting 48% from the field.**",eLevateAFFN,17,100,0.92

412,Gilbert Arenas’ MVP ladder: 1. Jokic 2. Giannis 3. Embiid,11ud1cm,">	“I don’t see the quantum leap from Embiid. He averaged 31 last year, he’s averaging 33 this year.

413,"If Nikola Jokic averages a triple-double this year, it will be exactly as rare to average a triple-double in a season, as it is to average 2+ blocks and 2+ steals in a season",11tzk4u,"Nikola Jokic is currently averaging 9.9 assists per game. If that number increases just a tiny bit the rest of the season, he will average a triple-double on the season.

**Triple-double seasons:**

Russell Westbrook (x4)  
Oscar Robertson (x1)  
potentially Nikola Jokic (x1)  

**2+ block / 2+ steal seasons:**

Hakeem Olajuwon (x4)  
David Robinson (x1)  
Gerald Wallace (x1)  

The triple-double is a sign of extreme versatility, generally on offense. The 2blk / 2stl in many ways could be considered the defensive version of it. Should Nikola Jokic join Russ and Big O, each statistical feat would have one player who has done it exactly 4 times, two players that have done it exactly once, and nobody else in league history.

414,Finally it is clear to me. The secret to Steph Curry's success is that he never stopped shooting his little kid shot.,11u9kre,"I was always a bit confused by Wardell Stephen Curry II. He seems like a normal player, but he's the best shooter ever. Better than Bird, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen. But why? Usually you don't get to be the BOAT at something unless, beyond your determination, have some serious uncommon advantages. I was never sure what it was with him. But now I see. It's little kid power.

So... [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtYJTAsNmg), you can see Steph warming up with his Dad when he was a kid. Obviously, he's heaving the ball at the basket in one motion like you usually do when you're a kid and your forearm and wrist alone aren't strong enough to get the ball to the basket (and I guess you're shorter too and need more arc). 

I think for most of us, when we get to be around 14, we start shooting a normal ""adult"" two-motion shot, with just our arm. But now that I think about it, we really have to learn that shooting form from scratch at that age. So if you enter the NBA at 21, you have at most 7 years of reps with your jump shot.

But Steph Curry *never changed his form*. Apparently he started playing rec league games when he was 6-years-old. So when he went into the NBA, he actually had 15 years of reps. 8 extra years of practice.

On top of that, as we can see in the video, he was flinging NBA 3-pointers from the time he was a little kid too. When he was nowhere near strong enough in the arms to get it to the basket normally. So he learned to use his legs and arms in his shot to give extra power to his heave while not losing any control. Throwing the ball from beyond wrist-flick range is what he's ALWAYS been doing. It just so happened that when he got to be grown-man size, that same practice let him step back to 30-feet easily.

That is all. Maybe some of you already knew this. But I wanted to share anyway.",EGarrett,22,32,0.68

The way games are called right now, bigs can seal the help defender and basically block them like an offensive lineman as their teammate takes the open layup. It’s a moving screen and it should be called. It’s gotten worse over the last few years but this year I feel like I’m seeing it on every drive.",jakehightower,11,25,0.82

438,"[OC] There are currently 19 left-handed NBA players in each conference - the Knicks have the most left-handed NBA players - 4. Five teams in the Eastern Conference don't have left-handed players, and 4 in the Western Conference.",11ty43i,"**A correction: 20 in the Western Conference & 19 in the Eastern Conference.**

**Five teams in the Eastern Conference don't have left-handed players & three teams in the Western Conference\*** 

I went through each team & its players at [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com) so you don't have to waste your time.

After the previous [left-handed post,](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/11tu45l/oc_the_lefthanded_new_york_knicks_this_season/) I went on with this.

Left-handed in your teams - I've never seen something like that in the past - so many left-handed (not even going through Bob Lanier, Bill Russell & Gail Goodrich eras - it wasn't so popular in the past) - left-handed people usually excel more in individual sports.

**I went through each team, and compiled for you the full list:**

East:

**Boston Celtics:** None.

**Philadelphia 76ers:** James Harden.

**New York Knicks**: RJ Barrett, Julius Randle, Jalen Brunson & Isaiah Hartenstein.

**Brooklyn Nets:** Nic Claxton & Ben Simmons.

**Toronto Raptors:** Thaddeus Young.

**Milwaukee Bucks:** Joe Ingles & Goran Dragic.

They also had Sandro Mamukelashvili (24 GP), but he got waived on March 1st, 2023, and claimed by the Spurs.

**Cleveland Cavaliers**: Dylan Windler.

**Indiana Pacers:** None.

They had Terry Taylor, but he got waived on February 9th, 2023 & he went on to sign a 2-way contract with the Chicago Bulls.

**Chicago Bulls:** Derrick Jones Jr. & Terry Taylor (TW contract).

They also had Goran Dragic before they waived him on February 28th, 2023 (he signed with the Bucks on March 4th, 2023).

**Detroit Pistons:** Killian Hayes, Marvin Bagley III & James Wiseman.

**Miami Heat**: None.

**Atlanta Hawks:** None.

**Washington Wizards**: Nunn. I mean, Kendrick Nunn (19 GP).

They also had Vernon Carey Jr., but he got waived on March 1st,2023 (wishing him luck finding a new team).

**Orlando Magic:** None (though I swear I thought they had one).

**Charlotte Hornets:** Kelly Oubre Jr. & JT Thor.

They also had Mason Plumlee for 56 GP, but he got traded on February 9th, 2023 to the Clippers. I think he is the only one to get ~~Right~~ Left on [BBref](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/plumlma01.html).

**That's a total of 19 left-handed players who are still currently playing for Eastern Conference teams.**

West:

**Denver Nuggets**: DeAndre Jordan.

**Minnesota Timberwolves**: Mike Conley (12 GP since he got traded to the T-Wolves) & Nathan Knight ([It's not updated in Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/knighna01.html)).

They also had D'Angelo Russell for 54 GP, before he got traded on February 9th, 2023 (the same deal that sent Mike Conley to the T-Wolves).

**Oklahoma City Thunder:** None.

They had Darius Bazley (36 GP), but he got traded to the Suns on February 9th, 2023.

**Utah Jazz:** None.

They had Mike Conley for 43 GP before he got traded on February 9th, 2023, to the Timberwolves. They also had Jarred Vanderbilt (52 GP), but he got traded to the Lakers in the same trade.

**Portland Trail Blazers:** Justice Winslow.

They also had Gary Payton II (15 GP), but he got traded to the GSW on February 9th, 2023.

**Sacramento Kings:** Domantas Sabonis & De'Aaron Fox.They also had Deonte Burton, but he got waived on February 7th, 2023.

**Phoenix Suns**: Cameron Payne & Darius Bazley (2 GP).

**Los Angeles Clippers:** Mason Plumlee (from Hornets - 11 GP).

They also had Luke Kennard (35 GP), but he got traded on February 9th, 2023 (and ended up in Memphis).

**Los Angeles Lakers:** D'Angelo Russell & Jared Vanderbilt (both came in the same trade).

They also had Kendrick Nunn (39 GP), but he got traded to the Wizards with 2nd round picks for Rui Hachimura on January 23rd, 2023.

**Golden State Warriors:** Gary Payton II (yet to play, injured).

They had James Wiseman (21 GP) but traded him to the Pistons on February 9th, 2023.

**Memphis Grizzlies:** Luke Kennard (12 GP), Vince Williams Jr. (TW contract) & Kenneth Lofton JR (TW contract).

**Dallas Mavericks:** None.

**New Orleans Pelicans:** Zion Williamson (29 GP) & Herbert Jones,

**San Antonio Spurs:** Sandro Mamukelashvili (6 GP),

**Houston Rockets:** Kevin Porter Jr. & Trevor Hudgins (TW contract)

**That's a total of 20 left-handed currently in the Western Conference.**

&#x200B;

**A total of 39 left-handed players currently play in the NBA.**

P.S:

I think the Rockets have the most players with Jr. in their team - Kevin Porter Jr., Jabari Smith Jr., Kenyon Porter Jr., and TyTy Washington Jr.",MrBuckBuck,34,40,0.95
439,[Schaefer] Bulls' new starting lineup (when whole) of Beverley-LaVine-DeRozan-Caruso-Vučević has best net rating of 5-man units that have played at least 150 mins this season in the NBA,11tvz1i,">But since the All-Star break the Bulls have found a fruitful five-man formula that they are hoping will propel them to the play-in tournament — a revamped starting and closing lineup of Patrick Beverley (who signed from the buyout market in mid-February), Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan, Alex Caruso and Nikola Vučević.

>Entering Friday's game against the Timberwolves, for which Caruso is questionable with an illness, that unit owns a 119.1 offensive rating, 95.5 defensive rating and plus-23.6 net rating across an admittedly small sample size of 155 minutes, according to NBA.com. That is the best defensive and net rating for any five-man combination that has shared the floor for at least 150 minutes this season.

441,What current player is the most respected player when including both talent and character?,11ufgax,I tried to Google an opinion article but all I found was who's the best considering talent and skills without considering character.,shannon247,71,4,0.57
442,24 of 30 teams have won and lost four games in a row this season,11tv885,"Phil Jackson's teams, at least the good ones, were famous for rarely losing three in a row. Maybe it was Zen-like focus. Or MJ and Pippen, Kobe and Shaq, and Kobe and Pau. But if they dropped a couple in a row, they quickly got their shit together.

 The Bulls lost the first three games of the 1990-1991 season. They did not lose three in a row again until the 1993-1994 season.

After Phil Jackson assumed duties as coach of the Lakers in 1999, they did not lose three in a row until February 19, 2002.

The Lakers lost three in a row on January 27, 2008. They acquired Pau Gasol shortly thereafter and did not lose three in a row again until March 7, 2010.

During the 2022-2023 season, 24 of 30 teams have lost four games in a row AND won four games in a row. I used a four game metric as a sufficient sample size that seems above a temporarily little blip or brief exercise in competence. 

The only teams who have NOT won four games in a row AND lost four games in a row are the Celtics (have not lost four in a row, title contender), 76ers (have not lost four in a row, title contender with an MVP candidate) Rockets (have not won four in a row, tanking), Spurs (have not won four in a row, tanking), Pistons (have not won four in a row, tanking), and the Bulls (have not won four in a row, are a mess).

What conclusions can be drawn from this date? Evidence of the randomness of the three? Load management and stars not playing? Parity of the league? It seems very unusual that 80% of the league is good enough to win four in a row and terrible enough to lose four in a row.",EricHangingOut,21,49,0.92

> Morant explained his behavior on the flight as celebrating a seminal moment with the people closest to him. But he had six points and three assists in 17 minutes during the game, with some sources close to the situation believing his sluggish play was the result of his partying.

> In early July, the Grizzlies awarded Morant with a five-year extension of his rookie contract, the “supermax,” worth at least $193 million. That same month was when the alleged incident between Morant, Pack and a teenager occurred at Morant’s house. According to The Washington Post, another incident took place at a Memphis mall four days later in which a security guard said Morant “threatened” him during an altercation in the parking lot. Per the report, the incident began when Morant’s mother got into a dispute with an employee at a shoe store and called Morant for assistance, and he arrived shortly thereafter “with as many as nine other people.”

Steph currently averages 5.0 threes per game, which would comfortably put him first in the 3PM per game category (Klay and Dame tied for second with 4.3 each).

459,Jakob Poeltl: The Most Underrated Center in the League,11v7yb6," 

I'm here to make a case for why Jakob Poeltl is the most valuable center in the league and how he can help the Raptors return to championship contention.

First off, let's take a look at his stats. Poeltl is averaging 9.4 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks per game this season. While those numbers may not jump off the page, he's doing it all while shooting a remarkable 65.7% from the field. That's second-best in the league among centers with at least 5 field goal attempts per game, behind only Rudy Gobert.

But it's not just his efficiency that makes him valuable. Poeltl is an elite rim protector, ranking fourth in the league in blocks per game. He alters shots and forces opponents to alter their game plan when attacking the basket.

But where Poeltl really shines is in his ability to set screens and roll to the rim. He's an excellent pick-and-roll player, and his ability to finish at the rim makes him a perfect fit for the modern NBA. He's currently averaging 1.34 points per roll, which is fourth-best in the league among centers with at least 3 rolls per game.

Now, I know what some of you are thinking. ""But what about Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokic? They're the best centers in the league!"" And while they're certainly great players, I would argue that Poeltl is more valuable to his team than either of them.

The Raptors have struggled this season, but Poeltl has been a bright spot. When he's on the court, the team has a net rating of +2.1. When he's off the court, that drops to -4.9. That's a massive swing, and it shows just how important he is to the team's success.

But the real reason why Poeltl is so valuable is because of his contract. He's currently making just $8.3 million per year, which is a bargain for a player of his caliber. With his current contract, the Raptors have the flexibility to add more talent around him and Pascal Siakam this offseason.

Jakob Poeltl is the most underrated center in the league. He's an elite rim protector, an excellent pick-and-roll player, and he's doing it all while shooting an absurdly high percentage from the field. He's also incredibly valuable to the Raptors, and his team-friendly contract gives them the flexibility they need to build a championship contender. Don't sleep on Poeltl, he's a future All-Star in the making.",SpicaComeBack,38,0,0.38

461,This will likely be the 4th consecutive year the NBA sets a new record for league wide free throw shooting.,11ttcur,"Here are the top 10 free throw shooting seasons in NBA history:

|**Rank**|**Season**|*FT%*|
:--|:--|:--|
|**1**|**2022-23**|*78.234%*|
|**2**|**2020-21**|*77.755%*|

|**9**|**2017-18**|*76.705%*|
|**10**|**2018-19**|*76.631%*|


The record set in 1974 stood for over 40 years before finally being broken in 2017. Each of the past 4 seasons have continued to improve upon that all-time mark. 

What are the reasons we are seeing such an all-time high in free throw shooting? It's the one shot in basketball that's been essentially unchanged for over 100 years. Are players league wide just now finding a way to improve their shooting form? Highly skilled free throw shooters getting to the line more? A small rule change that has somehow increased free throw shooting? Or something else entirely?",RecordReviewer,20,32,0.71

People are gonna probably wonder why they're so high on the Cavs and low on the Bucks, here is the reasoning


> Since 1983-84, 36 of 39 champions have had a point differential of plus-4 per game or better—and this season, only the Celtics, Cavaliers, and Nuggets fit that criterion. If you’re wondering why the Cavaliers’ title odds look so strong here, that’s the main reason: They’re neck and neck with Boston for the best Pythagorean record in the NBA.


----

> Riding a 12-game winning streak, the Bucks are only half a game behind the Celtics for first place, but they have benefited from a league-best 22-6 record in “clutch” games—and there’s no correlation between clutch performance in the regular season versus the playoffs. The Bucks’ point differential is also just plus-3.2 per game, which ranks only fourth in the East. Since the playoff field expanded to 16 teams in 1983-84, only one team has won the title with a worse point differential: the sixth-seeded Rockets in 1994-95 (plus-2.1 points per game).",AbshirThePoet,109,21,0.65
471,Will Domantas Sabonis make an All-NBA team this year?,11te60a,"I've always felt that Sabonis has been a bit underrated for a while. But with the Kings playing so well, and with the numbers Sabonis is posting up, I think he has a great shot of making all-NBA. 

Embiid and Jokic have the first and second team Center spots locked up (In no particular order), so that just leaves one spot open for the third team. Sabonis' biggest competition for this spot would be Bam Adebayo, and while Bam is a better defender, All-NBA focuses more on offense, where Sabonis is superior. 

He's posting up 19/12/7, and is essentially a triple double threat as a Center/Forward hybrid. Moreover, he has been hyper efficient this season, shooting over 60% of the field with an impressive 67% TS. 

So with all of this being said, do you think Sabonis makes All-NBA this year? And as a bonus question, do you think he's a top 3 center in the NBA, surpassing KAT?",Varolyn,104,186,0.96

Since their 2021 eastern conference finals run, they were the 8 seed and lost to Miami in round 1 last year in 5 games with the series being uncompetitive for the most part and this year even despite getting Murray they fired Nate McMillan the guy that was a reason why they got to the conference finals 2 years ago and they hired Quinn Synder and right now they are the 8 seed in the East like last year and our hovering around mediocrity and have never really taken that “next” step since they made the 2021 conference finals.

8 points in a win against the Raptors. 

17 points in a loss against the Knicks. 

35 points in a win against the Pelicans. 

Load-management in a loss against the Rockets. 

26 points and single-handedly organizing a 6-1 Maxi Klieber run with 8 seconds to go to gift the game to the Mavericks. 

He obviously can’t be the guy for your franchise. That’s embarrassing. 

Chuck and other old-heads call him “street clothes” and don’t give him the Giannis level of respect, because he is just soft. Lacking the winner’s mentality. 

12 games remaining with a chance to get the 6-7 seed? Nope - Anthony Davis just sat one game out and choked the other game away. 

Instead of being 36-35 and tied with the Warriors for the 6th seed, the Lakers are 34-37 in the 10th spot. 

LeBron chose the wrong superstar to team up with in Los Angeles.

Voting always is, should and will be subjective, objective, and biased depending on the voter. There may be guidelines for voting but there cant be criteria. What are the criteria when voting for US President? You can't be serious and tell me that the last 4 presidents all checked the same boxes. What are the criteria when voting for Miss Universe or Eurosong or anything else that we vote on? Voting is not grading.

10,Traveling: A Closer Look at an Underrated Skill,11xnwbk,"Greetings, fellow NBA enthusiasts. 

Today, we will delve into a topic that is often overlooked in the game of basketball - traveling. While dribbling is undoubtedly a crucial skill, let us not underestimate the strategic benefits of traveling.

Recent research has shown that when a player takes a few extra steps, they can cover more ground and reach the basket faster, thus increasing their chances of scoring. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Sports Sciences found that traveling can result in a higher field goal percentage, especially for taller players.

Moreover, traveling can create unpredictability on the court and throw off defenders, making it an effective offensive strategy. This is because defenders are conditioned to anticipate certain movements, and traveling can provide a surprising element to the game.

In terms of turnovers, which are a concern for any basketball player, dribbling carries a higher risk than traveling. This is because when a player is dribbling, the ball is exposed to potential theft by the opposing team. In contrast, traveling only results in a turnover if it is detected by the referees, which is not always the case.

Even some of the greatest players in NBA history, such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, have used traveling to their advantage, often in the form of the ""Eurostep"" maneuver. LeBron James is also known for his impressive strides before a dunk, which demonstrates the power of traveling in creating scoring opportunities.

In conclusion, while dribbling is undoubtedly an essential skill in basketball, it is important to recognize the potential advantages of traveling. Research has shown that traveling can lead to higher field goal percentages, create unpredictability, and reduce the risk of turnovers. 

So the next time you see a player take a few extra steps, remember the science behind the skill.",simocm11,13,0,0.2

20,"When Kareem retired, he was top 20 all-time in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.",11xkxls,"Here is where Kareem ranked all-time in the 5 main counting stats when he retired at the end of 1988-89 season:

|Stat|Total|Kareem Rank|
:--|:--|:--|
|Points|38,387|1st|
|Rebounds|17,440|3rd|
|Assists|5,660|14th|
|Steals|1,160|19th|
|Blocks|3,189|1st|

Couple caveats with this is that the NBA didn't start officially recording steals and blocks until the 1974-75 season, so there would have been plenty of guards that had more steals than Kareem. Wilt and Russell would have been 1/2 in blocks, but Kareem did end up 1st in blocks despite missing out on them counting his first 4 seasons, so he might have retired 1st in blocks anyway. 

With all that said, I didn't realize he had racked up so many assists over his career. We often remember Wilt and Walton as being great passing centers from the 60's and 70's, but Kareem was no slouch either when it came to dishing the rock. At 7'2"", he's still the tallest player to ever average 5+ assists for a season (according to basketball reference heights at least).

&nbsp;

LeBron was the next player I though of when I looked up Kareem's stats, but due to playing in a different era, and the league having 75 years worth of seasons for other players to rack up big numbers, his ranks don't quite stack up to Kareem. Here is where LeBron currently ranks all-time in the 5 core counting stats:

|Stat|Total|LeBron Rank|
:--|:--|:--|
|Points|38,450|1st|
|Rebounds|10,606|32nd|
|Assists|10,371|4th|
|Steals|2,180|9th|
|Blocks|1,067|91st|

Still really impressive, but just in a different light. Depending on when Chris Paul retires, LeBron will finish either 3rd or 4th in assists and will still hold the all-time scoring record, which is just bananas to think about in the context of literally any other player's skill set all-time.",RecordReviewer,16,20,0.81

35,"Ainge for executive of the year: With only ~10% of the season remaining, the Wolves and Jazz have the same record (.493)",11xczck,"With the season heading towards an end, both the Jazz and Wolves are in the same spot fighting for the play-in. Ainge managed to trade away the core players, getting at least 8 first round picks in return, cleared up cap space, and still added young talent in return.

For reference, Kessler, who Ainge wanted as a Gobert replacement, has so far averaged 12.3 ppg 11.1 rpg, and 3.4 bpg while shooting 79% in March. Gobert so far in March is averaging 16.3 ppg, 11.3 rpg, and 1.8 bpg shooting 63%. The wolves are 4-5 and the jazz 3-3 so far in March.

Not only are the Jazz competitive now, but they have what appears to be a young core, with lots of money on hand, and lots of picks. Who could have imagined the Jazz being in this position when there were talks about ""blowing up"" the team?

36,The Nuggets have 10 games to play and Jokić is 69 assists from breaking Chamberlain’s 55-year-old season assist record.,11xc74j,"1968, Wilt Chamberlain carried his team to 62 wins, the best record in the league, leading the league in total assists with 702. This was the only time a center had ever and would ever be the assist leader.

Wilt’s 702 assist record for a center surpassed his own 630 from ‘67 and Russell’s 472, also from ‘67.

Until this year, no center outside of Wilt has ever accumulated 600 assists in a single season. This year, Jokić has accumulated 634 assists and even has a shot at leading the league.

For Jokić to break Wilt’s assist record for a center, he would have to average at least:

10 games - 6.9apg

9 games - 7.7apg

8 games - 8.7apg

7 games - 9.9apg

6 games - 11.5apg

37,"James Harden is 9th in the current MVP ladder, yet missed the All-Star team and will likely miss All-NBA as well. Is Harden having the greatest ""no award"" season in NBA history?",11xc5ku,"The [current MVP ladder](https://www.nba.com/news/kia-mvp-ladder-march-17-2023-edition) has James Harden sitting in 9th place.

Harden is averaging 22/11/6 on the team with the second best record in the league. Philly currently sits at 48-22.

While this would normally be a shoo-in for not just an All-Star selection but a juicy All-NBA team as well, Harden was snubbed from All Star team. He was passed up for the likes of:

* Jrue Holiday (19/7/5)
* Tyrese Haliburton (21/10/4)
* Pascal Siakam (24/8/5)
* Demar Derozan (25/5/5)

who all made the team despite either having significantly worse stats or playing on a significantly worse team, or both.

All-NBA teams are more selective than the All-Star team due to having 37.5% less spots, so it's highly unlikely Harden will be rewarded with an All-NBA spot either.

I scoured hundreds player stats across dozens of seasons to see if I could find another season similar to the one Harden's having now, where a player is elite yet didn't collect a single award.

The closest I could find was **Damian Lillard's 2017 season**. Dame averaged 27/6/5, but Portland went just 41-41 and barely squeaked into the postseason. I believe the difference in record pushes it in favor of 2023 Harden.

Is anyone aware of a better ""no award"" season than the one Harden is having right now?",MarshalMichelNey1,18,0,0.42
38,[OC] Can't get the Wynne: the Sixers' struggles in their City Edition jerseys,11x92pa,"[Two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/11kxyge/oc_the_agony_and_the_ecstasy_embiid_plays_amazing/) I looked at Embiid's amazing stats in the Sixers' City edition jerseys, and the team's mediocre win-loss record in the same games. 

After two more games (a [win against the Wizards](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202303120PHI.html) and tonight's [loss against the Bulls](https://www.nba.com/watch/video/full-focus-bulls-snap-sixers-winning-streak-in-double-overtime)) nothing has changed - Embiid's average stats are still crazy playing at home in the jerseys (40 points, 11 boards, 4 assists, 0.86 steals and 2.7 blocks), he is a cumulative +40 in those games, and the Sixers have only won three of the seven, despite winning 70% of their home games for the season.

Miami are the last team to play them in these jerseys, three days before the end of the regular season on April 6. Mark your calendars (or don't - this is still a pretty small sample size, even if it's weird their home record is so much worse in these jerseys than out of them).",Mackinaw,1,10,0.78
39,Taurean Prince had the most efficient 30 point game in at least 40 years,11x7ig4,"EDIT: upon double checking Davis Bertans holds this title. He had a game in February 2021 vs the Nuggets where he scored 35 points, shooting 9-11 from the field, all 3’s and a perfect 8-8 at the line, good for a 121 TS% statmuse gave me the wrong information, apologies. However this game was played in an empty gym with no fans which made shooting *a lot* easier in many instances. Plus it’s still a historically efficient game for prince so worth the post imo

35 points on just 13 shots and 4 free throws 119 true shooting. 

Statmuse only tracks TS% going back to the 1982-1983 season but having TS% well over 100 like this was basically impossible before 3 pointers. 

Prince beats out Richie Frahm who scored 31 points on 11 shots December 20th 2003, for a mere 117 true shooting, he averaged just 3 points and didn’t score more than 17 any other game that season, or his entire career for that matter. He never averaged more than 4 PPG and was a journeymen at best. Prince is arguably a journeyman himself and has had a much better career. Somewhat similarly. prince’s season high was just 19 before his 35 point outburst tonight.

Frahm statline: 31 points, 10-11 from the field, 6-7 from 3, 5-5 at the line

Prince statline: 35 points, 12-13 from the field, 8-8 from 3, 3-4 at the line

If I was forced to predict someone to break this record I would go with Isaiah Joe. Elite shooter who mostly will just shoot 3’s, can easily have a game where he goes like 8 for 9 from deep, but won’t mess up his efficiency by taking any stupid 2’s.",AdviceEuphoric4852,32,214,0.94
40,"Since the All-Star break, Utah Jazz rookie Walker Kessler has been the league leader in blocks per game with 3.8 BPG. He is averaging an entire block per game more than the DPOY favorite Brook Lopez (2.8).",11x7h4m,"Kessler has been sensational, and while he won't get true ROTY considerations, he definitely deserves to be in the conversation as a third party. The impact of him on defense is so big that in a weird sense, it has almost made me forget that he's a rookie because I take it so for granted. He looks very polished defensively. 

A notable fact to mention, if post-Allstar break is too small of a sample size for some reason, is that Kessler is 2nd in BPG since the turn of the calendar year (2.9 since January 1st) behind Jaren Jackson Jr.'s 3.0 BPG. He is 4th on the entire season, behind JJJ, Claxton, and Brook Lopez. He is a rookie. Future DPOY?

43,"With the Kings' loss, the Grizzlies have regained the 2nd seed!",11x5vez,"Despite Ja's suspension, they went 6-3 in those games. The next two games are against the Rockets in Memphis. Will the Kings be able to get it back?",Traditional_Brief806,53,82,0.78
44,NBA Related Data Science Project,11x5uqp,"Hey everyone, I have been a fan of the NBA for a while and I am looking for some ideas for a data science project that is centred around that. I plan on using a Bayesian framework and if I can come up with an interesting question with appropriate data, hope to employ a hierarchical model. 

I have some ideas of what I can look into, but also wanted to make this post and see if any of you guys have any interesting ideas? Maybe some NBA fan data scientists in here who have a question but don't have the time to explore it? Let me know what you guys think of the following brief snippets:

&#x200B;

1. I came across the topic of 2 for 1 possessions which peeked my interest. A 2 for 1 possession is a strategy used during the last minute of the quarter or period. This strategy is done by timing a shot to make sure that the team that has the possession of the ball can regain possession and have enough time to shoot again. They are somewhat polarizing, with some thinking that the strategy is very poor because the play is often rushed and the team ends up taking a bad shot for the sake of a 2 for 1. Is it really better to take 2 potentially poor shots versus 1 good shot? Are certain types of shots (i.e. a three pointer vs midrange vs layup) better to perform with 2 for 1s in mind? Not sure what other factors or predictors I can come up with but, but that is the idea. I would also need to figure out how I would quantify the ""effectiveness"" of a 2 for 1 possession, or where I could even find such data. 
2. The effect of a team's offensive/defensive rating and its players offensive/defensive ratings. Obviously there is correlation there, but I think it may be interesting to look into player transfers and the effect over time.  How does a player's defensive rating change from before they joined the team to when they have been with the team for a bit? Are more highly defensive rated teams better at developing a players defensive rating, or is it more about the player's own training regiment. Does having better defenders on your team, make you a better defender? Unsure about what covariates I can use to construct a model here, but this framework may lend itself nicely to something hierarchical? Team level stats having effect on player level stats.
3. Player misutalization. There are instances in basketball where one player is doing really well, then they get traded to a new team with a different play style, and suddenly they are ""terrible"". This isn't necessarily because they player suddenly became worse, but because the new team isn't employing the player in plays or setting up in a way that leverages that players strengths. Sometimes teams realize that, make some technical adjustments and the player is suddenly playing really well again. I think it would be interesting to explore this further. Again not sure about how to set up a model or find data that would let me do some analysis. I would also need to see if there us some data on ""player strengths"". Maybe the response here can be some simple production statistics, like player plus/minus while the predictors are things like the type of play, the players strengths, interaction between the two, etc. 
4. A more simplistic idea is salary predictions based on various other stats like number of games played, points per game, winshares, injury proneness, etc. A bit simple and boring in my opinion, but maybe could discover something unexpected. Results could be used to forecast what a free agent may expect to be paid for their next contract or what to work on to increase that number the quickest.",BlackCoatBrownHair,13,21,0.89

Beverely gunning for those Back-to-Back Play-In Championships. Bulls are now 2 up on the Wizards for the 10th seed, a half game back on Toronto for the 9 seed and one game back back of Atlanta for the 8 seed (which would really improve their odds of making it out).",BigPoppaPuff,73,650,0.97

83,Why don't NBA defenses defend Giannis the way they do Steph Curry?,11wyulu,"ok it sounds ridiculous but hear me out. 

In the recent analysis involving the play where Giannis trucks Craig, it's deemed that the defender is not in legal guarding position. But instead of defenders playing this game of trying to draw charges and and ""build a wall"", why not do the opposite? why not just stay inside his jersey the whole game and never let him build up momentum?

Giannis starts running from the opposite three point line, by the time he gets into the defenders space, you're cooked. But imagine instead a defender just stayed within a few feet of him the whole game and never let him comfortably start running, or recieve passes.

Giannis isn't a 3 level scorer, he's not going to hit you with step back 3s and elbow pull up middys. Hes not going to hit you with nasty crossovers and get to open space. Hes not going to take you to the block and hit you with dream shakes and turn around hooks off the glass. 
The defender doesn't even need to be elite, they just have to reasonably stay in front of Giannis and prevent him from comfortably building momentum. 

Idk the last 5 years of trying to build walls and draw charges has resulted in him giving you 40/15 every night.  Am I crazy to think it's time to try a different approach?",HitboxOfASnail,50,0,0.42

97,[OC] Film Analysis on the Misuse of AD Offensively,11wt54w,"So through out a lot of AD's tenure on the Lakers, specifically this year, I feel like the team has done a pretty poor job of running the offense through AD and I decided to try and break down some recent film to look more into it. He makes plenty of mistakes so this post isn't attempting to absolve blame, but more just give constructive criticism to how he's being used offensively. Because of this I'm gonna focus on taking somewhat rare examples of the Lakers making smart decisions around AD to point out what they should do more often rather than just posting low lights

&#x200B;

Very curious for other's thoughts on what I'm suggesting they do more of, if you think the analysis is fair, or if you think you have even better ideas on how the team should be utilizing Davis

&#x200B;

PS This is my first time doing this so I'm very open to constructive criticism as there's at least a chance I'll try and do more stuff like this in the future

&#x200B;

Lets start with some examples of lack of off ball movement:

&#x200B;

[In this clip](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxPNDeyidPFfWSE3UPqYm8yFeW5xsw_KIz) you see the entire defense focused on him. Rui cuts to the middle of the paint but he cuts to a place where there's no open passing lane, but there's no meaningful movement on offense and it leads to a lazy iso jumper.

&#x200B;

[In this one](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxIUQdBUcwgAtQ67d3JizXFPvH1fGhV0YW) you see something somewhat similar with vando cutting to the middle, AD being doubled with  every player looking at him. He misses the shot but the lack off off ball movement just makes it incredibly easy for the defense to focus on him while cutting off passing lanes.

&#x200B;

Now if you watch the Lakers you've seen a ton of plays like this, especially since the raptors spent most of the game selling out to stop AD recently. The rest of the team stepped up in that game and punished the raptors for their scheme but as teams replicate the strategy its made the holes in the rest of the lakers offense much more clear. I'm not gonna spam a bunch more clips like the two before, but just wanted to give you examples of how the lakers offense running through AD is often just getting AD in iso and hoping he can beat a double/triple (which is obviously a terrible way to run an offense).

&#x200B;

Dibble hand off (aka DHO) potential:

&#x200B;

[Here](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx-FCN3q1vHLzKHTyWmtszJHOymzP0yTTd) you see  a DHO between AD and Reaves where ADs defender drops, reaves defender picks him up giving reaves a solid look. Not only this but Brown Jr's defender slides to reaves creating a wide open 3 on top of everything else

&#x200B;

[Plays like that](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxxigNpGj6clRkEU-O6xS2IQ9cQCftrvZv) open up opportunities like this where you can get Davis in single coverage once again because the defense has to respect his teammates on some level

&#x200B;

[Now after you've](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxSGzM7VkY8REtP5Rs2yezTzCF-CidhDup) established the threat of that it leads to plays where teams have to respect it, once again giving the best player on the team easy looks

&#x200B;

Off Ball cuts:

&#x200B;

[AD isn't jokic](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxEqO6IaSztQpJMT-SLXFuwp-9y1e2Cchn) but there are 100% ways you can set him up for easy passes to help create shots for others like this. 

&#x200B;

[Cutting more even when AD isnt the focal point of the play can open up](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxpVPgfUYDfXjXFJQyoeBX2gIMwjES0wxN) shots for him as well. He can be very effective off ball, and the more you can do stuff like this the harder it is for a coach to solely rely on swarming him

&#x200B;

Guard Screen potential:

&#x200B;

[Here](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxiRO1YGg_KN-fCncgBWwE0YjPgagQQ0TO) you have Beasley screen for Davis setting him up to take a midrange jumper. As we all know this isnt the exact spot you want AD shooting, but its so much better than what you see far too often -- him being swarmed with no one working to get open, often resulting in far worse jumpers

&#x200B;

[He misses this](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxnCLE2Zr9YKIITM-OLTE53U0YbatzgGPa) and once again its not ideal but seeing them try something like this is still an improvement over a lot of their stagnant possessions

&#x200B;

Id love to see them explore using guards as screeners off ball too when AD has the ball to create open shots for shooters while AD is posted up with the ball. Opening up a couple good shots for him to easily pass out to could really force teams to focus more time, energy and attention on the perimeter. [This isn't a perfect example](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxMGPsKPmyyEggnpkwZOULcjJVvRbYojxa) of that but its at least them using motion off ball to actually take advantage of the gravity AD creates so regularly

&#x200B;

Pick n Rolls (aka PnRs):

&#x200B;

This is an obvious one because AD is obviously a great lob threat, but I still feel as if the team doesn't try and use PnRs to their advantage as much as they should (LeBron coming back could help this a lot tbf)

&#x200B;

[The play](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxzTgI-l4OoFBEDagEpAeh-JNMQCHfnIK9) doesn't even have to be trying to force AD the ball, you can use it to open up passes to other players, which can in turn get enough of the defenses attention to get him open looks if the defense respects the other players just a bit

&#x200B;

[A similar example to the last](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxsZ8jPfO8x0nJD6ShoIjXmTOCEHDzWJA-)

&#x200B;

[A play like this](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxwyy2PBiqj6oQON9eV7NKHOrDz0QZg2bb) requires the defense respecting the guard on the roll, but this is the sort of pay off we can also see as we punish teams more from doubling AD. This is very achievable with LeBron, was a staple of the 2020 run, and yet its just severely under utilized even when he's playing

&#x200B;

[Another example](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxzTgI-l4OoFBEDagEpAeh-JNMQCHfnIK9) of an imperfect jumper that's still much better than a ton of their offensive possessions

99,How Do We Know Ownership Won't Make The LakerS Front Office Choose Between Reaves And D'Lo This Offseason?,11wsvot,"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10030461-how-la-lakers-mismanaged-their-way-from-champs-to-chumps
> Had L.A. paid Nunn a slightly lower figure in his first year (just $35,258 less), it could have used the remainder to sign undrafted rookie Austin Reaves to a three-year contract starting at $925,258, instead of a two-year minimum deal for the promising rookie.
        
Here's an article *today*: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-austin-reaves-is-making-a-leap-but-gilbert-arenas-rule-may-make-it-hard-for-la-to-pay-him-for-it/
    
So there you have it, Reaves wouldn't even be a RFA this offseason looking at a payday if LAL's front office had bothered to do their homework *after flunking it the first two times* with Caruso and THT. To be clear, the Lakers aren't the only team to screw this particular facet up (looking at you Chicago with Ayo), but it's so telling that it's such a repeating pattern. OKC got this right with Lu Dort. The Clippers did the same thing with Terrance Mann. The Pelicans' Front Office gets a lot of flack, but they nailed it *three times* between Naji Marshall, Herb Jones, and Jose Alvarado.  IF a player from outside the first-round is good enough to make the roster, he's good enough to get a 3+ year deal. What's the worst case scenario? He turns out to be as unplayable at the NBA level as plenty of other end-of-bench guys?
      
Correct if I'm wrong, but the last four players to play three years  *on the same contract* for the Lakers are: Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, and Julius Randle.  While Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker both played 3+ seasons, it came over the course of multiple 2-year ocntracts. Contrary to popular belief, it wasn't the Westbrook trade that cost the Lakers Caruso, it was not signing either him or THT to a 3-year rookie deal. Either contract would have put most of Caruso's cost for at least the 21-22 season under the luxury tax.   
    
Right now the Lakers are enjoying a strong 2nd half of the season, because Reaves on his current salary figure is helping to maximize the salary to production output ratio, but given the history of this front office (and the signing off by ownership) of not committing to anybody other than super stars to longer than two years, how likely is that both come back? Especially if there's any hitch with Dallas retaining Kyrie? Even if you  retaun D'Lo *at 60%*, the reported offers for Reaves with D'Lo would still put LAL too close to the luxury tax for auxulliary moves.

103,"Suggestion to improve on bad refereeing, teams should have unlimited amount of “correct” reviews. You lose that with an incorrect one",11wrq52,"I’ve seen this system in cricket. It made terrible referees stand out and it improved the game dramatically, why are we not doing this.

Also there is so much more technology now used in other sports for reviews like Hawk-eye, infrared etc. NBA is extremely profitable and they shudnt cheap out on things that improve the game.

Contenders - 

Nuggets - Will Nikola Jokic and his supporting cast perform in the playoffs like how they started the season or play like they have been these last few weeks?

Grizzlies - Will Ja come back and be locked in mentally be able to get back into game shape before the playoffs? Also, will Desmond Bane and Steven Adams be able to be healthy for the playoffs? 

Bucks - Can Giannis step and finally end any discussion of who is the “best in the world” and win a second ring and FMVP with a less than healthy team. 

Celtics - Can the team run it back to the Finals, but this time with a completely different head coach. As well as Tatum proving he is a worthy MVP candidate.

Draft -

110,Who is the worst NBA player that could lead the 16th seed to a March Madness Championship?,11wq17r,"Who is the worst player in the NBA that could lead a 16th seed to a March Madness Championship?

I saw this question on Twitter and wanted Reddit’s opinion. This is also a gauge in the difference in ability from college to NBA.

I think we can cross off MVP level players, I firmly believe Giannis/Jokic could lead the “scrubs” to the ring. 

On the other hand is it outrageous to say role players couldn’t achieve this? Maybe it’s dependent on position, I don’t think back up point guards such as Caruso or Ish Smith could overcome the difference in talent between 16th seed and elite teams. 

So it begs the question what type of talent is the bare minimum needed to overcome the odds. 


Things to consider: 
- Shorter 3 Point Line
- Does it have to be a big man to help with defensive issues the team would have?
- Paolo Banchero couldn’t lead duke to the championship and he was the number 1 pick.
- They’re players in college right now better than some NBA players.",SpaceFluffy,108,0,0.4
111,"[Haynes & Stein] LeBron returning before the season ends is a stretch: ""Even when he does come back, he might not be fully healthy, but just trying to buy him some time. I don't know how realistic it is that he returns with some games left in the regular season""",11wq0q4,"**On when LeBron might return and if he'll be fully healthy.**

""I think obviously the goal is for LeBron to return at some point before the season concludes, but what I'm hearing is that still might be a push right there, him returning at some point. I reported a few weeks ago... the Lakers had to try and do whatever they could to try to win as many games as possible to give LeBron James as much time to recover as possible. So that means that even when he does come back, he might not be fully healthy, but just trying to buy him some time. With that said, I don't know how realistic it is that he returns with some games left in the regular season. That is definitely the goal, LeBron James is shooting for that, I just don't know how realistic it is right now.. Can LeBron come back the final two games of the regular season? ... I think definitely that's a possibility but I think it's still premature as of right now. The way it was explained to me that might be a push right there""

112,Who had a worse series in 2022: Tatum v GSW OR Durant v BOS,11wpv2r,"Both players struggled mighty in their respective series as both shot below 38% from the field (even though Tatum shot above 44% from 3 which makes no sense). That is probably the worst series of Durant’s career IMO.

Both players never really got it going or had shown glimpses of their potential, and effectively lost. Both also had 1 game where they were both below 20 points (KD G3, JT G6) and less than 5 FGM (JT G1 - 3/17, KD G2 - 4/17).

\#	|	Team	|	Δ	|	Record	|	Comment	|
--: 	|	:--	|	:--	|	:-:	|	:--	|
1	|	[](/MIL) Bucks	|	--	|	51-20	|	The Bucks are rolling. As winter fades away in Milwaukee, they have emerged as the clear-cut favorites to win the East -- and maybe the whole thing. They have a 2.5-game cushion over the second-place Celtics and Sixers with only 11 games left, and Vegas has finally given them their due respect as the title frontrunners. Giannis is the best player in the sport even if nobody wants to give him the MVP, Brook Lopez might be playing the best basketball of his All-Star career at 34, and Khris Middle is basically back to normal. Watching this team the last few months has been a treat as a fan, it certainly feels like the best Bucks team I'll see in my lifetime.	|
2	|	[](/PHI) 76ers	|	+2	|	48-22	|	The Sixers are rolling and Joel Embiid might finally lock up a legacy defining piece of hardware. It's hard to argue against the Sixers being one of the hottest teams in the league right now, especially as some of the teams in front of them are having some stumbles down the stretch. A big reason why The Sixers are succeeding? Tyrese Maxey. He's once again found his aggression and his shot from deep. They'll need him and Harden to play at this level to finally break the second round curse.	|
3	|	[](/BOS) Celtics	|	--	|	49-23	|	The Celtics are 7-6 since the All-Star break and have continuously floundered to find any sort of stable footing. The fanbase is fighting over whether to place the blame on Joe Mazzulla or Jayson Tatum, or a combination of the two. Tatum has been hot and cold all season, and recently has played awful. At the same time, Joe Mazzulla has had multiple questionable to outright malpractice coaching decisions, especially when it comes to in-game play calling down the stretch. To make matters worse, the 76ers finally caught up and overtook the Celtics for the 2 seed in the East. It's time to nut up or shut up for the Celtics, and the final 10 games of the season will determine how the fanbase and the team as a whole feels going into the postseason. They've got matchups @Kings, Pacers, Spurs, @Wizards, @Bucks, Jazz, @76ers, Raptors twice at home, and then the Hawks at home to close out the season. The fight for the 2 seed could very well come down to April 4th when the Celtics go into Philly, but before that you have to take care of business and win the games you're supposed to win, or else the Celtics won't even be in a position to fight for 2nd. 	|
4	|	[](/DEN) Nuggets	|	-2	|	48-24	|	Despite remaining on top of the West, the Nuggets have struggled as of late, only winning 2 of their last 7 games. Defense and rebounding have disappeared and allowing second chance points has been a common theme. Despite this, the team is still at full strength and they still have time to adjust and refocus in time for the playoffs.	|
5	|	[](/CLE) Cavaliers	|	+2	|	45-28	|	The Cavs went 5-2 since the previous power rankings and will need to have a 5-4 or better record over the last 9 games to get their first 50 win season without LeBron in 30 years. With 7 of those matchups being against Brooklyn(2x), Houston, Charlotte, Indiana, and Orlando(2x), it would be a massive disappointment for them to go under .500 in this final stretch. Evan Mobley has been special over the last two months, averaging 18.8 ppg on 58.6% ts%, 9.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.4 stocks a game, while cementing himself as a DPOY candidate as the anchor of the Cavs #1 rated defense. On the season, he’s leading the league in defensive win shares, he has the most 3s contested in the league, and is in the 99th percentile rim protection. Cavs fans would take to the streets for anything less than 1st team all-defense for the 21 year old Mobley.	|
6	|	[](/SAC) Kings	|	+2	|	43-27	|	The playoffs are well within the grasps of the Kings.. showing they can beat some of the best teams in the league Fox continues to show he’s the 4th quarter assassin. Sabonis has been on fire throughout this tough stretch putting up triple doubles and making sure this team gets open look with his passing and screens.. Keegan “Keegan Murray” Murray continues to showcase his three point game as he is 22 away from breaking the rookie 3pt record held by Donovan Mitchell. This team continues to their mission to not only stay within the top 6 but have their eyes set on the 1 and 2 seed in the west. 	|
7	|	[](/NYK) Knicks	|	-2	|	42-30	|	[GO NEW YORK GO NEW YORK GO](https://external-preview.redd.it/x8A52EJKcvFkTU7iUgE2Z2vhHQZgFTlnMbKdAUXDQPs.gif?width=356&height=200&format=mp4&v=enabled&s=16c05952ede16ab9207a1ec23b009e6fdcbf37ca)	|
8	|	[](/MEM) Grizzlies	|	+1	|	43-27	|	The team has responded nicely to the absence of Ja while he was on his healing retreat; and frankly there's a ton of praise to be passed around. Tyus Jones getting his first triple double, Dillon Brooks being generally a menace to society, David ""Big Body"" Roddy jumping up the rookie charts, but ultimately the love has to be centered around Jaren Jackson Jr. His last three games have him averaging 28/6/2 as well as keeping his blocks average close at 3. The version of JJJ we saw against Golden State is a guy that could be an MVP caliber player; an elite offensive rim protector and an elite post threat. His fouling has been much better all season, and the race for DPOY between him and Brook Lopez looks to be a photo finish. Ja comes back from his suspension on Monday, with a potential to make his first appearance on Wednesday against the Rockets; just in time to prime up for what looks to be a promising playoff run.	|
9	|	[](/PHX) Suns	|	-3	|	38-33	|	KD slipped during warm ups. Luckily he looks alright and I think he's just out as a precaution, but we gave up two important pieces to get him and it shows given the recent stretch of games while he's been out. 	|
10	|	[](/LAC) Clippers	|	+4	|	38-34	|	Westbrook is starting to settle into his role, and Ty Lue is searching for the best rotations. Already Westbrook has been an amazing facilitator, and even when his shots aren't falling the way he wants to, he is still able to rebound, find open shooters, or just organize the offense in ways we haven't seen since CP3. With only 0.5 games behind the suns, the Clippers could regain the 4th seed for some home field advantage, likely against the Suns.	|
11	|	[](/MIA) Heat	|	+2	|	39-34	|	Things have gone better as of late but they're going to hopefully get better. We went .500 against teams in similar places as us as well as blowing the Grizzlies out of the water. Now we're headed into a couple difficult games mixed in with some games that we have no business losing. The tentative hope would be for us to sneak out of the play-in, although we're probably not getting passed our first match up. If we do avoid having to play the play-in tournament, then best match up to see us in the 2nd round would be the Cavaliers. However, a Celtics - Heat match up would be very exciting to watch. Or maybe a throwback of Knicks vs Heat from forever ago. First thing's first is making sure we are actually involved in the postseason this year. 	|
12	|	[](/BKN) Nets	|	+4	|	39-32	|	The Nets are looking better defensively as the players get more familiar with one another. While the offense depends on good shooting from the three point line, defense is something that the Nets can control every night. High powered offense will give this Nets team trouble as they will have to scramble to match the offensive output some teams can put forth. It's a developmental season for this unit, they will look to hold onto the 6th seed and try to put upa  fight in the playoffs as they move forward to the draft with 2 picks to work with	|
13	|	[](/DAL) Mavericks	|	-2	|	36-35	|	The Mavs may have saved their season off of Maxi Kleber's heroic 3 against the Lakers and Dwight Powell's 22 & 8 on 100% shooting vs the Spurs. The common factor in those games is that Christian Wood played 28+ minutes in both games, which has become a rarity. If the Mavs can finally play their three best players (Luka, Kyrie, Wood) for 30+ minutes each, they should be able to close their weak end of schedule out with dominance.	|
14	|	[](/GSW) Warriors	|	-4	|	36-36	|	The road Warriors strike again. The last time the Warriors lost at home was Feb 11th (8 game win streak) The last time they won on the road was January 30th (11 game losing streak). Nothing like sleeping in your own bed. With his wrist injury Iguodala is essentially retired. The once cornerstone roll player quintessential to the 2015 championship run will be forever a Warrior and fan favorite.	|
15	|	[](/OKC) Thunder	|	+6	|	35-36	|	The Thunder are still somehow alive for a play in spot. This week we play the Clipper twice and Lakers once and will likely determine the feasibility of whether or not we can pull this off. Every game has been super intense because the stakes have been so high (for us). Each win feels more and more important, and all I can really say is: the vibes are immaculate.	|
16	|	[](/LAL) Lakers	|	+2	|	35-37	|	The team built great momentum and really looked poised to get into the top 6, until they dropped two inexcusable losses to the Rockets and Mavericks, specially the Mavericks loss was a gut punch for the team and fan base. The Western standings are so fluid that the Lakers were a Kleber buzzer-beater away from being the 6th seed and now instead are the 10th. They bounced back on Sunday vs. the Magic led by AR’s career-high 35 and the hope is to keep fighting through till the King’s anticipated return within the next couple of weeks. Meanwhile, AD has struggled with his offense as of late and the team needs the big man to tune himself back in for the final push.	|
17	|	[](/TOR) Raptors	|	-1	|	35-37	|	Toronto looks like a team slightly better than .500. For some fans, this gives them hope, while some other fans are worried the Raptors will be stuck in the no man's land for years to come. 	|
18	|	[](/ATL) Hawks	|	-1	|	35-36	|	There's a lot of ""Is Quin Snyder actually better than Nate McMillan"" discourse going on right now. Mostly because the Hawks with Quin have also been terrible, but most people seem to be missing the point of why we brought Quin in the for the final 20 games. It wasn't for him to come in and turn our season around and win us a championship. There was never going to be enough time for Quin to make tangible changes. These last 20 games are for Quin to evaluate the roster and figure out who he does and doesn't want around next year. This team was always going to end up the play-in, but that doesn't matter because this season (and last season) was a wash the day they signed Nate to an extension. I don't really know if the future is bright or bleak, but it's the only thing worth focusing on. 	|
19	|	[](/MIN) TWolves	|	-7	|	35-37	|	Tough season for the Wolves got tougher over the weekend. A season compromised by the injury of Karl-Anthony Towns got worse with Anthony Edwards going down to an ankle injury. Combined with so-so play and tough losses the Wolves season is looking like a disaster. 	|
20	|	[](/CHI) Bulls	|	+4	|	33-37	|	Pat Bev was able to score 14 points in 2 and a half minutes, so I'm feeling better about this team. They have been playing better at both ends, and are actually making 3s now, shooting 42% since the last rankings. Whoever told Demar to start shooting 3s and Vucevic to stop shooting 3s was a genius. The next 2 games against the Sixers will show how this team can handle playoff talent in the East. 	|
21	|	[](/UTA) Jazz	|	+1	|	34-36	|	The Jazz face a choice, so dire, To compete and let the players aspire, Or tank and aim for a high draft pick, For a new franchise star and experience to stick. To give up now, and look ahead, Or fight for wins, and never dread, To a future, with a top prospect in tow, To fight for each win and go with the flow. Lauri Markkanen, a star on the rise, could he lead the team, to a new prize, And Walker Kessler, has blocks to spare, should the Jazz keep pushing, or choose to take care? A dilemma, that weighs heavily on the mind, But the answer, they will eventually find, For every player, coach, and fan, Utah need to hold firm and take a stand.	|
22	|	[](/NOP) Pelicans	|	-3	|	34-37	|		|
23	|	[](/WAS) Wizards	|	-3	|	32-39	|	Lizards are part of a group of animals known as reptiles. They are most closely related to snakes. In fact, some lizards, called sheltopusiks, look like snakes because they have no legs! Many lizards today resemble the ancient reptiles of the dinosaur era. Their ancestors appeared on Earth over 200 million years ago. That was also the last time the Washington Wizards looked like a competitive, cohesive basketball team. Corey Kispert has been incredible these past couple of weeks as he prepares to become a married man. Bradley Beal continues to be enemy number one for fans as nothing he does can appease critics of his large contract. And unfortunately, it looks like the Wes Unseld Jr era could be coming to a close after this season and he continues to have worse rotation management than a flat tire. Its a sad season.	|
24	|	[](/IND) Pacers	|	+1	|	32-39	|	The Pacers continue to tread water as the season winds down. Rookie sixth man Bennedict Mathurin and Tyrese Haliburton's injuries have put a damper on the final weeks, but Indiana still finds themselves just outside the play-in games. 8 of Indiana's last 11 games are against current playoff teams, so they'll probably need some assistance from the other playoff hopefuls if they want to sneak into one of the last spots. 	|
25	|	[](/ORL) Magic	|	+1	|	29-43	|	Probably stuck in the same spot in the standings regardless of what happens rest of the season. So time to just look forward to the lottery and the draft.	|
26	|	[](/POR) Trail Blazers	|	-3	|	31-40	|		|
27	|	[](/CHA) Hornets	|	--	|	22-50	|		|
28	|	[](/SAS) Spurs	|	+1	|	19-52	|	Jeez we gotta stop timing these with drinking weekends, I live in Boston and St. Patty's is always a mess. The Spurs have been on a bit of a heater recently by our standards (as have Houston, for that matter), while Detroit seems to be leaving the rest of the tanks in the dust at this stage. Keldon and Devin have been playing great (Keldon's averaging 22/7/4 while Vassell is averaging 17/4/4), and are showing the potential of being great supporting pieces on a future playoff team. Zach Collins has been a stud since Jakob was traded as well, averaging 16.6/8.1/3.8 on 46/44/91 splits over that time, and more recently has average 23/8/4/1/1.5 on 53/57/100 since getting choked out by MPJ in a game. We have NOP, MIL, WAS, @BOS, UTA, @GSW, @SAC coming up over the next two weeks, home stretch time!	|
29	|	[](/HOU) Rockets	|	+1	|	18-53	|	Jabari Smith's surge mirrors what we saw from Jalen Green after the all star break last year, and it has brought newfound optimism to the Rockets fanbase, and KJ Martin seems to have stepped up in tandem. Make no mistake, the tank is still in effect, but we're seeing the first signs that the team could make the step up that is demanded next season.	|
30	|	[](/DET) Pistons	|	-1	|	16-56	|	James Wiseman is coming off of what was probably the best game of his career last night against Miami. I've still got mixed feelings about trying to develop both him and Duren, but they have looked nice together at times recently - particularly against Denver when they were throwing each other lobs. Otherwise Ivey's cooled off on his shooting recently but his ballhandling continues to, generally, be getting stronger as the season wears on. Eugene Omoruyi has been a surprisingly strong late season addition that much of our fanbase would rather retain over Marvin Bagley. That said, the tank rolls on as we look toward a draft that seems to have more question marks in it - not less - as we inch closer to it.	|",powerrankingsnba,46,103,0.93

Should Reaves keep leading the tank gang or look to join a contender this offseason? The Lakers will have to extend Dlo and Rui as well, not to mention Beasley’s team option, so it’s possible at least one of them will leave or get traded.

Some notes:

First off for my Sonics fans, if the thought of GP being the all-time leader in games played for the Thunder doesn't sit right, you can replace him on this list with Russell Westbrook who played 821 games for the Thunder. 

The Pelicans/Hornets thing might seem complicated at first, but it's pretty simple. The Pelicans get credit for all the games in New Orleans and the Hornets get credit for all the games in Charlotte (despite the fact that's not exactly how things played out). 

I mentioned Giannis as the reason for this post in the first place, and it's largely because I had no clue who the Bucks leader was in games played prior to him. It was Bucks legend  >!Junior Bridgeman!<.

Lastly, here's a list of every player in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons with a single franchise:

1\. Dirk

T-2. Kobe

T-2. Udonis Haslem

That's right despite playing 20 seasons for the Heat, Haslem is still not the franchise leader in games played. I know he's essentially been an assistant coach for the past 5+ seasons, but it shows just how unique he is that he can bring value to 1 franchise for 2 decades despite his limited ability to actually play.",RecordReviewer,41,86,0.93

Steph: 29.8/6.2/6.2 on 50/43/91 splits (66.6 TS%), 46/72 games played

Dame: 32.2/4.7/7.2 on 46/37/91 splits (64.5 TS%), 57/71 games played

Mitchell: 27.4/4.1/4.6 on 47/37/87 splits (60.7 TS%), 61/73 games played

I personally think Steph has missed too many games to make it - historically 56 games (if he plays every remaining game) gets you at best 3rd team so it's probably between Dame and SGA assuming both play the rest of the season.",d33jay64,176,38,0.88

It’s only been a few games, but the early returns are encouraging: the Heat are 3-1 when he has played in this stretch.

Lowry has been a boost to the Miami Heat bench unit since returning and has proven himself to be a steadying presence that sharply contrasts the sporadic play of Victor Oladipo, who he has replaced in the rotation.

He will still be the owner of one of the worst contracts in Heat franchise history, but it’s nice to see that Spoelstra is finding ways to maximize him in a limited role (and that he apparently is accepting of this new role).",lopea182,25,64,0.85
137,Why do people think Steph and KD have declined?,11whyw3,"For the past year I've been seeing people saying that these 2 have declined. Sometimes it's outright explicitly saying it and sometimes it's putting players like Giannis or Jokic over 2 guys whose peaks are top 15 all time at the very least. I just want to know why people think these 2 have declined. 

In 2021, these guys were top 3 locks according to everybody. Both had arguments for best in the world with Lebron's decline that year. Steph had his best or second best regular season that year while KD showed that while he had changed, he was still at least as good as he was in OKC/GS. KD was pretty much the consensus best player after the Bucks series that year(which I thought was undeserved because Steph and Harden both outperformed KD in the RS and didn't really get to show out in the playoffs to sway the public). Last year KD looked just as good while Steph started the season on an absolute tear. They were the leading MVP candidates and people said that they were better than ever. KD ended up missing too many games while Steph went on a months long slump after Thanksgiving that was clearly unrelated to his body declining. Steph ended up breaking out of his slump became a monster in the playoffs as usual and won a ring+FMVP. KD had a bad first round series, but that was clearly due to factors outside of his control like Ben Simmons' salary not playing and Kyrie not showing up while KD was getting swarmed by the Cs. KD has proved this season that he's still the same player though and both of these guys are putting up some of the best stats of their career, even when adjusted for pace and efficiency. Watching them, I legit don't see any difference between 2023 and 2021. 

While I can see how KD's less varied and more specialized shot selection can turn off some people, I don't get how that doesn't make him even better seeing as how his midrange jumper is wetter than ever. His defense is back to GS level despite having less help too. Additionally, even if we ignore all context in last year's playoffs, 4 games doesn't compare to the 35-50ish RS games he's played each year since 2020-21, many of which featured KD coasting due to age and recent injuries. 

On the other hand, there's absolutely no argument for Steph being any worse than he was at his peak. Statswise, he's been pretty consistent with his past seasons. Going off the eye test, he's better than he was in the early dynasty years due to his added strength and improved defense and virtually identical to 2021. Like KD, he's had random contact injuries this year, but Steph has never been the epitome of good health and his injuries haven't slowed him down one bit. 

How are these guys not the consensus #1 and #2 in the league? Do people not watch their games anymore? These guys have adapted their games like Lebron did in his second Cavs stint to become better than ever. Saying that anybody else is close to these 2 is straight up disrespectful.",NotUrAvgShitposter,36,0,0.3

Pg - Magic Johnson - magics passing would be a show to watch on its own. His length would makes up for steph being undersized. But steph is also excellent at playing off ball and would get a crazy amount of clean looks of magic.
Sg - Steph Curry - Curry is a player who excellent at playing off the ball and moving through picks that’s his game.
Sg - Micheal Jordan - MJ is there for ISO’s and taking over the game if needed
Pf - Kareem Abdul Jabbar - Adds another unguardable dimension with the sky hook. Kareem wins chips in highschool, college, and 6 nba rings? 
C - Shaquille O’Neil - Shaq would easily be one of the best screen setters which would open crazy looks for steph and better spacing for magic to move around.

Dennis Rodman - every successful team needs hustle player. Hustle to players who do that do well on other stats besides scoring with first class defence at any position while having the ability to get into players heads to the point their playing bad is underrated with results!

19 PPG, 13 RPG on 15 FGA per game 

During the 2022-2023 season Anthony Davis is averaging 25.8 PPG on 17.2 FGA and 12.5 RPG in 46 games played. 

But it seems that he becomes very passive with D’Angelo Russell in the lineup. 

His PPG drops from 25.8 to 19. 

His FGA drop from 17.2 to 15. 

Is this because D’Angelo is not a true point guard, but more of a scoring guard? 

He doesn’t seem to have a good passing ability, but he shoots and scores well. 

I think he is a perfect fit next to LeBron and AD for spacing and scoring purposes, but he is detrimental to AD’s offensive game when he is the main ball handler.

If you take his stats without LeBron and D’Lo we can see why some consider him the top 10 player: 

His PPG increases up to 33 PPG and he takes 4-6 more shots per game. 

This is the Anthony Davis the Lakers need to make the playoffs. A 33 PPG monster who takes 20+ shots per game and grabs 15 rebounds. 

It’s sad to see him play like Kevon Looney so often. 

Just running around, grabbing rebounds and setting screens that don’t turn into PNR opportunities for him.",ThunderClown101,15,15,0.69

5 years apart from each other, the Houston Rockets and Miami Heat embarked on winning streaks of at least 22 games, an NBA rarity. The Boston Celtics had the unique opportunity to try to snap each streak before it reached 23. The dates of each game were March 18, 2008 and March 18, 2013, respectively. Given the odds of these events taking place on the same date, I thought I would see if there were any other strange coincidences surrounding these streaks/games.
 
The streaking teams involved are the T-Mac/Yao - ""Ming Dynasty"" Rockets and the BBW's Heat (Bron, Bosh, & Wade) (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  better known as ""The Heatles.""
Here are the links to the streaks:

### Streak Similarities: 
 
+ Both the Rockets and Heat won 26 of 27 games, thanks to their streaks.

+ Both the Rockets and Heat were victims of each other's streaks. [Meaning the Rockets beat the Heat during their streak, and the Heat beat the Rockets during theirs.]

+ Both the Rockets and Heat had winning streaks of exactly 4 games immediately preceding the start of their 20+ game streaks. The last 2 wins of those 4-game streaks took place on the *same dates*, 1/23 & 1/25. Both 4-game streaks ended on 1/27. By the way, the days of the week for these dates are exactly the same (i.e. 1/23 is a Monday for both years, etc.). ^**Because ^2008 ^was ^a ^leap ^year, ^and ^2013 ^was ^not, ^the ^days ^of ^the ^week ^are ^no ^longer ^synced ^after ^2/28.

+ Both the Rockets and Heat beat the Atlanta Hawks on 3/12, 6 days prior to their showdown with the Celtics, AND it was their 2nd time beating the Hawks during their respective streaks. Atlanta scored 18 points in the 1st quarter in both of the 3/12 games. 

**Now on to the 3/18 games: Celtics vs. Rockets and Celtics vs. Heat.**

### Game Similarities: 

+ The Celtics were on a 2 game winning streak coming in to both games.

+ Guess which referee reffed both games (1 guess):          >!Infamous NBA referee Scott Foster officiated both games (because of course he did, but you already knew that didn't you?).!<

+ The winner in each of the 3/18 games went on to win the NBA Championship later that season.

+ Boston made exactly 15 FTs and had 3 players in double figures in both games.

+ The ""No Stats All-Star,"" Shane Battier played in both games for the team that had won 22 straight. He finished with a +/- of **-15** in both games. 😂

+ Paul Pierce played for Boston in both games. 

***
### Notable Missed Similarities: ###
+ Both Ray Allen & Kevin Garnett *could* have played in both games, but each were inactive for 1 of the 2 games, but NOT the same one. 
+ Rajon Rondo *could* have played in both games, but was inactive for 1 of them.


***
### Other tidbits:
+ Coming into the Boston game, the Rockets had a differential of +272 during the streak. The Heat had a differential of +257.

+ Mike Bibby was beaten twice (2/13 & 3/12) by the Rockets playing for TWO different teams during their streak because he was traded from the Kings to the Hawks on 2/16/08. 

+ Larry Hughes took 3 L's (2/7, 2/19, 2/24) from the Rockets because he was traded from the Cavs to the Bulls on 2/21/08.
  Drew Gooden and Shannon Brown were also traded with Hughes, but were inactive in 1 or 2 of the 3 games.

+ Patrick Patterson was beaten twice (2/6 & 2/26) by the Heat because he was traded from the Rockets to the Kings on 2/20/13. Cole Aldrich  and Toney Douglas were also traded with Patterson, but were inactive in 1 of the games.



***
### Related side note: 
##The Boston Celtics played the Golden State Warriors on 12/11/15, who had won 23 straight, so they were ***1 game*** too late from being the opponent in 3 of the 4 instances in which a team was going for their 23rd straight win. Boston, AGAIN, was on a 2 game winning streak coming into that game.

173,"The Other, Other Guy: The Third ""Star"" of NBA Championship Teams",11w48r4,"PRELUDE: My method of determining the third best player on teams is absolutely terrible, but I'm sticking through- I took the third best player of each championship team by win shares and ranked them all- first of all, I don't necessarily agree with every take from win shares, and some of them CERTAINLY don't match up with popular consensus. Anyway, on to the overly pretentious opening. 

Of course, a championship team is anchored by its super star- you think of the Jordan Bulls, Magic Lakers, Lebron whatever team he's on. Sometimes, there's even a duo involved, be it Duncan and Robinson, James and Davis, or Jordan and Pippen! Then you have the third guy. The mythical big three calls to mind images of super teams, but how does EVERY championship team's third guy shape out? Do you need a star to fill the role? To explore this question, I ranked all 73 ""third"" players by win shares! To go with the regular season stat (winshares), also throwing in a few rudimentary stats from their playoff run that year! Who contributes more to winning? Another premier scorer or that rock solid glue guy?

193,The Denver Nuggets might need to trade Jamal Murray,11vz652,"BEFORE YOU RESPOND, please just read the post first because the title is not what you might assume!!!


Nikola Jokic is making the Nuggets look a lot better than they really are, and if they want to have any shot at winning the championship, they need to get some more pieces around Jokic. 


However, looking at their salary situation, that is going to be a problem. Denver is currently $35 million over the salary cap, and they may very well have the worst contract in the NBA right now with Michael Porter Jr. Right now he’s in the first year of a 5 yr/$180mil deal that he’s on until the end of the 2027 season. I say this because while he’s an elite shooter, he provides little to no value in just about every other aspect of the game. He’s an adequate rebounder, maybe, but he’s a cone on defense and provides zero playmaking ability. He’s essentially a black hole on offense and a non factor on defense, and he’ll be making $180 million through 2027. I didn't even mention him being injury prone too. Not great.


Now if we take a look at their other pieces, the players that fit well with Jokic that Denver should absolutely not look to trade (if they can avoid it) are Aaron Gordon, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Bruce Brown. They all provide defensive value, can stretch the floor, and don’t need the ball in their hands to be effective. Outside of those 3 guys, the only tradeable pieces of some value that Denver has are Jeff Green, Ish Smith, Thomas Bryant, Zeke Nnaji… not really enough to get Jokic any legitimate help.


Now Denver obviously could package either 2 or 3 of the aforementioned players (Gordon, Brown, KCP) in order to find another star to pair with Jokic, but that would gut their defense and depth even further than it already is. And since the MPJ contract is one that I don’t think any other GM would be willing to touch, and Denver can’t do anything in free agency in terms of really bringing Jokic more help, Jamal Murray seems to be the odd man out here.


Murray had a great run in the 2020 bubble, but outside of then he’s mostly just been looking like an above average starting combo guard. He can create well enough for himself off the dribble, shoot pretty well, and provides some playmaking value, which could make him an enticing option for some teams, although the $160mil contract he’s currently on isn’t exactly team friendly either. I haven’t gone through a rundown of every team to find the one(s) that would bring back the most value, or that would even accept a trade for Murray, but given Denver’s options if they want to compete for and win a championship, it seems like pretty much the only way that they can go. Do you guys agree?


TLDR: Denver is in contract hell with the shitty MPJ contract and they’re way over the cap so they can’t do anything to get Jokic more help in FA, so presumably the only way they can get Jokic more help to compete for a title w/o gutting their defense and depth is trading Jamal Murray.",C-DogDriver,72,0,0.31

Not stuff like taking Giannis first overall when that was never a possibility at the time.

Like an example for the Sixers is they drafted Mikal Bridges in the lottery and traded him on the same day and/or Fultz not having a bizarre injury as the number 1 overall pick and/or letting Jimmy walk for Tobias Harris and Al Horford (ugh).  Obviously the butterfly effect would drastically change how the team operated if any of these came to pass but the Sixers werent that far away from:

PG: Harden

SG: Fultz

201,What kind of contract could a player like Kenny Smith in his prime get in todays league?,11vx3p8,"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smithke01.html

Talking about Kenny Smith from Inside the NBA. While he was never a superstar level player, he put up decent numbers and would probably be a starting guard  on a lot of teams in his prime. Would constantly get above 40 percent from 3 point shooting too.  

He averaged 17.7 ppg, 7.1 ast and 2.1 rebounds in his best statistical year which was his 6th season.

He was also able to average a similar stat line his sophomore season. 

I feel like he would have had a massive contract if it was negotiated after his 4th or 6th season, just going off the consistency and potential.

Beyond the stat line he was able to co exist with a superstar player like Hakeem and was able to bring out the best in each other. Valuable trait to have for teams that built around a star.",Aktor56,20,20,0.79

But, if Wembanyama is still under contract, would his drafting team have to pay a transfer fee to Metropolitans 92? This phenomenon is not unheard of in other European sports. For example, when Cristiano Ronaldo went from Manchester United to Real Madrid, Real Madrid paid his former club 80M euros.

218,(O.C.) All the players who've been the best player on a championship going back 1969,11vrl05,"I think this is one of the true lists in this sport. It happens quite often where the guy who won MVP seems like the best player in the league, but then it's the guy who brought home the ring who really gets that praise. Giannis for instance, after the playoff exit in 2020 was getting widely slammed despite being a back to back mvp but, upon winning the ring in 2021, he became the top dog. Only 5 active players have done that. and the list of active nba players who've been the best player on a finals team but not win the ring isn't too long either. (Tatum, Booker, Jimmy Butler, and if you want you can include Dwight Howard since he's technically still playing basketball).

So let's list them I'll put the first year they did it, which should help for multiple time winners. I'll be starting from the latest.

**Any miscalculations here**

Let me explain any ""controversial"" picks I made in the making of the list here.  I am putting David Robinson as the best player on the 1999 Spurs as Duncan was still young, but I genuinely am unsure and will trust a random spurs fan on here if they say otherwise. I also have heard that Joe Dumars was up there with Isiah Thomas for those late 80s Pistons teams. and I think you can make the point for either Ben Wallace or Chauncey Billups for the 04 Pistons.

Also, I should note that I put Magic's first year as the best player on the champion lakers as 82. I wasn't sure if there was a solid argument for Kareem that year. I know for a fact Kareem was better in 1980. I am also putting Moses Malone, not Dr J as the best player on philly in 1983.

I'm not an expert on 70s basketball. I had trouble finding much about the 1979 Sonics, but Dennis Johnson seemed to have the superior accolades. I may have overrated Dave Cowens and maybe should have put havlicek in 1974 but cowens was the mvp in 1973 and John was older at that time so I made some assumptions.  Also, because I'm stopping at 1969, players who lead their teams to victory before that year(namely, Wilt and Bill Russell) will be getting credit at the first point in the timeline.

&#x200B;

Hope that all makes sense.

**The Actual List**

&#x200B;

2021: Giannis

2019 Kawhi Leonard

2017: KD

2015: Steph Curry

2012: Lebron James

2011: Dirk

2009 Kobe

2008: Kevin Garnet

2006: D-Wade

2004: Ben Wallace or Chauncey Billups

2000: Shaq

1999: Tim Duncan

1994: Hakeem

1991: Michael Jordan

1989 Isiah Thomas

1983: Moses Malone

1982: Magic Johnson

1981: Larry Bird

1979: Dennis Johnson

1978: Wes Unseld(or Elvin Hayes OR Bob Dandridge) 

1977: Bill Walton

1975: Rick Barry

1974: Dave Cowens(or Havlicek)

1972: Wilt Chamberlain(or Jerry West?) 

1971: Kareem Abdul-Jabar

1970: Willis Reed

1969: Bill Russell.

Edits: took out David Robinson for 1999 and  Joe Dumars for 1989. added in some other options for several teams in the 70s.  thanks u/[**bonziwellsayo**](https://www.reddit.com/user/bonziwellsayo/)**,** for that suggestion.   
 

&#x200B;

In total, that's about 27 unique players over a 54 year span, with the 70s having the most names with 8  unique mvps. where as the 2000s(the second highest) had 6 unique MVPS and the 80s and 90s had only 4 unique MVPS.

&#x200B;

If you cut it off at 1980, you get a pretty even average of a new best player on a finals team emerging 5 times per decade. and it's been 2 years since Giannis did it for the first time. Maybe this is a sign a new player will do it this year?

&#x200B;

of the 27 players only 6 never won an MVP award. The ones who didn't are Kawhi Leonard, whoever you pick from the 04 Pistons, Isiah Thomas, Dennis Johnson, and Rick Barry.

&#x200B;

Players who HAVE won MVP but are not, as of right now, on that list: Nikola Jokic(2020-21-2021-22), James Harden(2017-18), Russell Westbrook(2016-17) , Steve Nash (2004-05, 2005-06), Allen Iverson(2000-01)  Karl Malone(1996-97, 1998-1999) David Robinson (1994-95), Charles Barkley(1992-1993) Julius Erving(1980-81) and Bob mcadoo(1974-75). Note though that Dr. J and David Robinson did win a ring as a top 2 option on the team, unlike others on this list so i don't think they should count in the same way. 

&#x200B;

In compiling this I used [this list of previous finals MVPS](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/finals_mvp.html) and cross referenced it with a list of mvps from the same source (bball ref), and would clarify with wikipedia and LandofBasketball to be sure i was picking the right guy.

219,"De, Aaron Fox's game resemble Manu Ginobili + Nick Van Exel?",11vr76c,"I was thinking about Fox's crazy euro step move on Kuzma from last night's game, wondering where I had seen that before, and I just got reminded about it. Manu Ginobili. Did a quick search and came across this:

 [Growing up in Texas, Spurs great Manu Ginobili had a huge impact on Kings' De'Aaron Fox | WOAI (news4sanantonio.com)](https://news4sanantonio.com/sports/spurs-zone/growing-up-in-texas-spurs-great-manu-ginobili-had-a-huge-impact-on-kings-deaaron-fox) 

Watching Ginobili highlights, especially on his drives, I feel like you can definitely see some of what Fox is doing now from them. Same for Van Exel too in the pull-up middy game from his Dallas years. Both players get the left-handed ""shifty"" label. 

Anyone else seeing that too?",bookishwayfarer,10,21,0.74
220,Dillon Brooks is defending All-Stars more than anyone and better than anyone.,11vqzlf,"[source: this tweet](https://twitter.com/spacesgrizzlies/status/1637440197943083010?s=46&t=YicQXQGzlG12umVyByMRSg)

>Information, Brooks has matched up in the half court defensively 922 times against this year’s All-Stars, the most of any player. He has held those All-Stars, from Tatum to Curry to Durant, to a 45.7% effective field goal percentage, which ranks first among the 72 players to record 400 such matchups. (League average, for comparison, is 54.6.) Among the players who have the most half-court matchups against All-Stars, Brooks is allowing the lowest percentage. In short, he has matched up against All-Stars more than any other NBA player, and he has defended them better than anybody else. Just one player - Lillard - has scored 40 against him this year.

Should Dillon Brooks make one of the All-Defensive teams?",xpillindaass,386,1779,0.82
221,No team in the three point era (since 1980) has won the Finals after finishing the season with a below .500 record on the road,11vqtwf,"Like the title says, all 43 of the last 43 NBA champions managed to end the year with a winning record in away games. Even the four teams to not qualify for the famous ""40 before 20"" rule all met this mark. ('95 Rockets, '04 Pistons, '06 Heat, '21 Bucks)

Currently there are quite a few top teams who do not fit this criteria such as: 

the Nuggets - 17-18 on the road

Grizzlies - 14-22

Cavs - 16-20

Suns - 15-20

Mavericks - 14-21

Warriors 7-29

Knicks - 22-14

We tend to cite “pace and space” as the reason for the league’s scoring spike, but that wouldn’t explain the recent jump in FT%. The league FT% has been fairly steady for decades but it’s spiked recently.

There could be several factors for this —

— teams are playing fewer “bigs,” who traditionally aren’t good free throw shooters. They’re also running the offense through the post less often, which may mean fewer FT attempts for the big dudes who are still there.

— the league-wide emphasis on shooting may mean the perimeter players (guards and forwards) are better shooters than the past. We don’t see many defensive specialists anymore, or even traditional point guards who aren’t shooters (like a Rajon Rondo type.)",ZandrickEllison,34,170,0.96

248,is it legal to offer a upper mid tier free agent a huge one year contract (well worth their value) with the caveat of signing a minimum the next year?,11vcap8,"



Let’s say your team (mid/large market) has a summer where a max slot (however it may cost in any given year) frees up, but no big stars are available, but, the next year - multiple top 5 players are - however, there are quite a few decent starters (like we’re talking B- to C tier dudes who are great contributes, think of guys worth 10/20 mil, for example. These guys can’t lead a team, but they’re very solid contributors. However, if you sign them to multi year deals - you lose out on your max slot. 


Now, what i want to ask if the following would be legal:

Let’s say you offer two of these players, who are normally worth 10-20mil each a huge one year contract. Ex. Two one year 30mil to them, and mention that they intend to sign a big star the next year, however, if you wish to win the championship, you must sign the minimum the next season. You don’t have to sign, you can even turn this down if another team pays you more, but just know that this is the only condition i would have to give you this large overpay for one year. 


Is such a thing legal? or would it count as tampering? you’re not giving them money under the table per say, you also aren’t making them commit to the min the next year and are basically giving the player to go to another team in the next summer if they so wish. The move does look suspicious, but is is legal?",KayRay1994,19,6,0.67

A lot of trash talk, a lot of shooting and the Memphis Grizzlies outplay the Warriors without Ja Morant yet again.

275,"With tonight’s loss against the Grizzlies, you guessed it, the Warriors once again have an inverse home-road record.",11v8owf,"Home: 29-7

Road: 7-29

What do I even say anymore? They have the 3rd worst road record and the 3rd best home record.

Early in the season it could be written off as them simply having bad luck, or missing shots, etc. At this point is it fair to say these are essentially two different teams? If this is the case, without home court advantage in any series, what are the odds we see them bounced in the first round in 5-6? 

Furthermore, with the West play in race being so tight, it’s plausible they end up the 8 seed or worse the 9 seed and potentially have to play one of the games on the road. Many have already pencilled in the Warriors as a playoff team, but with a rough schedule and plenty of road games left, there’s absolutely no guarantee they stay afloat. 

All this to say, if the Warriors miss the playoffs, or they get bounced early in an uncompetitive series, will we see this core broken up in the offseason?",william4534,52,368,0.95

283,Jakob Poeltl: The Most Underrated Center in the League,11v7yb6," 

I'm here to make a case for why Jakob Poeltl is the most valuable center in the league and how he can help the Raptors return to championship contention.

First off, let's take a look at his stats. Poeltl is averaging 9.4 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks per game this season. While those numbers may not jump off the page, he's doing it all while shooting a remarkable 65.7% from the field. That's second-best in the league among centers with at least 5 field goal attempts per game, behind only Rudy Gobert.

But it's not just his efficiency that makes him valuable. Poeltl is an elite rim protector, ranking fourth in the league in blocks per game. He alters shots and forces opponents to alter their game plan when attacking the basket.

But where Poeltl really shines is in his ability to set screens and roll to the rim. He's an excellent pick-and-roll player, and his ability to finish at the rim makes him a perfect fit for the modern NBA. He's currently averaging 1.34 points per roll, which is fourth-best in the league among centers with at least 3 rolls per game.

Now, I know what some of you are thinking. ""But what about Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokic? They're the best centers in the league!"" And while they're certainly great players, I would argue that Poeltl is more valuable to his team than either of them.

The Raptors have struggled this season, but Poeltl has been a bright spot. When he's on the court, the team has a net rating of +2.1. When he's off the court, that drops to -4.9. That's a massive swing, and it shows just how important he is to the team's success.

But the real reason why Poeltl is so valuable is because of his contract. He's currently making just $8.3 million per year, which is a bargain for a player of his caliber. With his current contract, the Raptors have the flexibility to add more talent around him and Pascal Siakam this offseason.

Jakob Poeltl is the most underrated center in the league. He's an elite rim protector, an excellent pick-and-roll player, and he's doing it all while shooting an absurdly high percentage from the field. He's also incredibly valuable to the Raptors, and his team-friendly contract gives them the flexibility they need to build a championship contender. Don't sleep on Poeltl, he's a future All-Star in the making.",SpicaComeBack,38,0,0.42

But their current team looks primed to be one of the leading contenders of the East and frankly the title.

The West is looking kind of weak at the moment and a betting man would favor a champion from the East. Of the three main contenders (Sixers, Bucks and Celtics), Embiid may be having the strongest season of any player. They have figured out the Harden/Embiid PnR and have a reliable 3rd option in Maxey and have looked like the strongest team in the league since the All-Star break.

300,Why have the Bucks been so much better than last season regular season wise?,11v578q,"This Season with 12 games to go, the Bucks have already won 50 games and will likely be the 1 seed.

Last season the Bucks won just 51 games and got only the 3 seed.

Why have they been so much better this year in the regular season than last season? If I had to take a guess I would say because Brook Lopez has stayed healthy throughout this season unlike last season where he was out for most of the season.

2020-21: Jazz had a +9.2 and the Clippers had a +6.2, with several others trailing close behind.

2021-22: Suns had a +7.5, Celtics had +7.3, and Warriors had +6.5.

This year: Zero teams above +6.0, and only two teams above +5.0 -- the Cavs at +5.6 and the Celtics at +5.4.

What do we think is the reason for this? League-wide parity? A lack of great teams or bottom teams? Interested to hear what people think.

310,Are the Denver Nuggets contenders or pretenders?,11v1knw,My gut says they're the latter even though I'm a big fan of Jokic. I just think they lack a real second star. Jamal Murray is a quality point guard but he's not like a Lillard or Steph for example. If they had like a Paul George or a Demar Derozan in addition to Jokic and Murray then I think they'd be a real threat. What do you all think?,RaiseLive1654,188,42,0.64

314,Worst award winning seasons from players in the last 25 years,11v16rw,"Who is the worst player to win each award in the span of 1998-2022? And I don't mean worst player in terms of career but worst seasons to win every major award. If you think 25 years is going too far back I'll try to include modern examples. Awards/honors to be omitted from this are all-defensive team, all-rookie team, stat leader titles like steals leader, all the character/community work awards, and All-Star Game MVP (b/c nobody gives a shit in the ASG)

Final disclaimer, **I'm not saying any of these players are bad because that's dumb to say that, I'm just comparing it to all other winners of the same award**

_______________________________

**MVP** - Karl Malone 98-99

This was the worst season in the given time frame pretty easily, MJ retired, lockout shortened, pace was slow as hell, no star player really stood out or had that great of a year. They had to give it to someone so they chose Malone. What's funny about this one is that Karl Malone's numbers were down than years prior, like this was his 10th highest season in PPG pretty sure. Other candidates would be Iverson in 01, Rose in 11, Nash in 05, Curry in 15 was kinda weak. Again great seasons but keep in mind it's compared to other MVPs

**FMVP** - Andre Iguodala 14-15

Not saying the man didn't deserve the award but come on, he was given it for being the most effective at stopping Lebron even though he still put up 36/13/9. Let's be honest, either Lebron or Steph should have won

**DPOY** - Marcus Camby 06-07

Should have been Duncan's, Camby is also the only retired DPOY never to be an all-star in his career. Other answers for this, and both of these will get shit, Kawhi's second DPOY in 2016 which should have been Draymond's, and Marcus Smart in 2022 which was questionable to say the least. I mean come on Gobert and Giannis were better defenders and he wasn't even the best defender on the team last finals (timelord)

**Sixth Man** - Jamal Crawford 2015-16

This one stuck out to me because 35 year old Crawford was absolutely not a better 6th man than someone like Iguodala. Not that it really matters but it was purely a reputation award or a name they associate with the trophy. Pretty sure he won it over Ginobili in another year too

**ROY** - Mike Miller 00/01

Respect to Mike Miller and everything but that draft was straight booty cheeks and Miller would average 12/4/2 on 29 minutes. But then again there is Malcolm Brogdon with 10/3/4 on 26 minutes in 2016-17, honestly take your pick

**Hustle Award** - Amir Johnson 17-18

Dumbass award lol but why Amir Johnson? I don't think even 6ers fans know

**Most Improved Player** - Alan Henderson 97-98

I'll be honest, I don't know who this guy is. He put up 14/6/1 and played for the Hawks. You can maybe say Monte Ellis in 06-07 putting up 17/3/4 on the Baron Davis Warriors. idk

**All-NBA First Team** - DeAndre Jordan 15-16

Another tough one because of course there wont be any bad players here but it's gotta be him or Marc Gasol in 14-15. DeAndre Jordan was a great player, one of the best defenders in the league (behind Draymond and Kawhi at that time but still), elite rebounder, elite rim protector, great at setting screens, highest FG% and efficiency at that time. But let's face it, it was a weak era for centers. People will say Joakim Noah but I remember each of these years and I'd put him ahead of DAJ or Gasol

**All-NBA Second Team** - Vin Baker 97-98

Baker was playing for the Sonics and was putting up 19/8/2, of course it was a great season but he was 11th in scoring and was competing with Shaq, Robinson, Webber, Mutombo, etc... at the same position. Maybe I'm being biased towards big names though in this case. Modern example? Uhhhhh... Julius Randle 2 years ago? Maybe Siakam in 2020. Again it's hard to say and I'm not trying to hate on these guys or anything, someone who knows more should comment if I'm off base

**All NBA-Third Team** - Eddie Jones 99-00

Put up 20/4/5 on the Hornets. Marbury the same year put up 22/3/8 on a bad Nets team, pretty empty stats. As you can gather it wasn't the strongest era for NBA talent. But modern examples again? Maybe Bogut in 2010, David Lee in 2013, Shaq in 2009

I don't really feel like doing all-defensive teams very much since I don't know how to judge defensive ability or whatever criteria. Knowing about different basketball players than your team was different up until 10 or so years ago because cable TV is all you had. Same for all-rookie teams, there isn't a way to compare players without it taking all day basically so I'll skip them. But here are some bonus awards for non-players:

**Coach of the Year**- Sam Mitchell 06-07

He was the coach of the Raptors who went 47-35 to make 3rd in conference that year, it was his only winning season on not that good of a team. Speaking of Raps coaches, Dwane Casey 17-18 is probably #2 for worst

**Executive of the Year** - Elgin Baylor 05-06

This one is tough because it was probably seen as a great year (47-35, 6th in conference) but Baylor is not fondly remembered as Clippers GM. They would go back to being >.500 the year after and he had only 2 winning seasons in 10 years, but the worst owner in NBA history was running the organization so how much can you blame Elgin. Other candidates are Masai Ujiri in for the 2013 Nuggets, great season but Morey should have won

**Western Conference Champion**: 2006 Mavericks

The West wins the title most of the time, it's crazy looking at finalists considering 16/25 have won and those who didn't were mostly repeat finalists. But I go with 06 Mavs for this one because of a comparably mediocre roster around Dirk and Dirk was still in his choker days. I'll talk more about this finals later but they were the worst interior D the Heat had faced and they didn't double Wade. But other acceptable answers for this are the 04 Lakers for being washed/chemistry issues, or 2021 Suns for last 10 years

**Eastern Conference Champion**: 2002 Nets

Honestly chose your pick between that or the 03 Nets, the East was just complete garbage and either team probably loses in the first round if they were in the West. In 03 they made it to the finals with a piping hot 49-33 record and they were coached by Byron Scott. Other answers for this would be 01 Sixers, 07 Cavs, 20 Heat

**NBA Champion** - 2006 Miami Heat

Ignoring all the controversy with the refs/calls in the final, this isn't that great of a roster. Sure you had Wade at his best and Shaq in his last prime year (put up 14/10/3 in the finals series however) but Haslem, Jason Williams, and Antoine Walker were the starters and washed up Zo, GP, Derek Anderson were depth. SVG was also fired 20 games in. It really is a shame how people will overlook Wade turning into MJ by going 35/8/4 because ""it was rigged"" despite it being a top 5 finals performance ever",lowercase-punishment,26,16,0.73
315,Which title in this century has the biggest asterisk?,11v10jo,"For any reason: questionable refereeing (fixed games), injuries, complete luck

Notable years:

2002- Lakers win a wcf against SAC that looked blatantly fixed

2006- DWade shoots more freethrows than the entire Mavs team

2012- Miami Heat get some very favorable refereeing against a baby Thunder team

2015- Okc, Memphis, and Rockets plagued by injuries so the west is wide open. Warriors face an injured Cavs team in the finals without Kyrie and Love

2016- Green is suspended in the finals

2017/18- Durant Warriors superteam rings

2019- Raptors beat Sixers with a lucky bounce game winner. Beat Warriors with no Kd and Klay get’s injured

2020- The infamous bubble (mickey mouse) playoffs 

2021- Bucks get a very luck break against the Nets when iron man Harden suddenly has an injured hamstring. Kyrie goes down after Nets are up big. Kd still nearly pulls off the upset but an inch saves the Bucks season and their coach’s career.

""Perusing around @bball_ref and found that the #Suns have shot more FT's than their opponent 23 times in 70 games (33% of games).

That is fourth lowest in the league by percentage:""


[](https://imgur.com/63ATWCB.jpg)

Some interesting tidbits are the Lakers out shooting opponents at the free throw line 72% of the time! 

Also,  the Bucks which are towards the bottom of the league in free throw attempts per game end up outshooting their opponents in 51% of the games. I'd be really curious on the opponents that the bucks are regularly outshooting. Pretty sure most of them are playoff opponents.

I'm starting to think that free throw attempts per game is not really a good gauge on whether a team is receiving a fair whistle. I think first percentage of time out shooting an opponent/quality of opponent is a much better indicator.",Jesmer8490,40,31,0.8

322,Is Gary Harris’ 3 point shot back?,11uyk1b,"Gary Harris used to be a very good young player. He could shoot, make some plays, and defend. Unfortunately, starting in the 2018-19 season he went from a good shooter to mediocre. From 2015-16 to 2017-18 he shot 38.9% from 3, but could not reach 38% in any season out of his next 3. In those next 3 seasons he shot 33.7% from 3 and lost a lot of his value as a player. Now though, he looks like he may have found his shot again. In the last 2 seasons he is shooting 39.9% in 100 games. He’s been above 38% in both seasons and this season he is at 42.5%.

Just to be clear, I don’t think the 3 point shot is the only reason Gary Harris fell off the map. He’s dealt with a lot of injuries and his 2p% also fell off. However, I do think he can be a useful player in a good team’s rotation if he continues to shoot like this.

Luka 
Dame 

Those are the only PGs I could take over Trae. I honestly don’t see an argument for Ja, Fox, Garland, or Hali, just because Trae had a rough start to this season. 

27 and 10 on good efficiency doesn’t just grow on trees and Trae has basically been doing that since his 2nd year at 20 years old, and now he’s playing solid defense too. 

With Quin Snyder as his new coach, he’s 
27/4/9 on 48/41/90 so far after 9 games. 

And obviously we’ll see what happens in the playoffs but as long as the Hawks aren’t facing the Heat, even if they lose in round 1 I think Trae will bounce back from his performance last year. 

Next year we could see an MVP-like breakout season from Trae…

331,"De'Aaron ""I'm F**king Nice"" Fox - Game Icing Stats (with video)",11uw3oo,"We've all seen Fox's excellent 4th quarter and clutch time stats, but I was curious: how many times this year has he been the one to actually ice the game?

I have a bunch of grading and lesson planning to do, so instead I just spent an hour going back through game logs and highlight videos.

I looked at two categories:

* Fox Game Winners - Fox scores the go-ahead bucket, and that is the final points of the game (I kinda cheated on this for a couple of them). I also looked to see how many of these were buzzer-beaters.
* Fox Daggers - I defined these as any game where Fox hit the Kings' final field goal, followed by some Kings FTs because of intentional fouling.

Here are the results:

The King have won 26 games by a single digit margin this year. In those games...

Fox has **7 game winners** (again two are a slight stretch but I'm counting them), a whopping four (!!) of which were buzzer beaters. 

* 11/5 @ Orlando, he hits the [unforgettable logo buzzer-beater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu1OZ4M6Cjc) to win it 126-123
* 12/14 @ Toronto, he drives to the rim and draws the foul with 0:05, and goes 1-2 to put the Kings up 3. On the next possession Siakim hits the putback after a missed FVV three, so this one is kinda cheating, but Kings don't win in regulation without that free throw.
* 1/3 @ Utah, [he hits the driving layup as time expires](https://youtu.be/tKXRDPZijNs?t=435) (call on the floor was that he didn't get it off in time, overturned on review) to win 117-115 (this is after Markkanen draws the 3 shot foul with 16 seconds to go and hits all three to tie)
* 2/8 @ Houston, [he draws the three shot foul from *Eric Gordon as time expires and hits all three](https://youtu.be/qaSTT5rsxqM?t=409), to win 130-128
* 2/11 vs. Dallas, he gets to the FT line three times in the last 18 seconds of OT, going 6/6 to win 133-128 (you could call this a bit of a stretch, but the Kings needed every single one of those six points)
* 2/24 @ LAC [he hits the go-ahead 2-point pullup jumper at 0:36 in 2OT](https://youtu.be/IUqEYXRn4HA?t=445), after creating that possession by picking Mason Plumlee's pocket. These are the last points of the game. Honorable mention for [assisting Monk's insane game-tying 3](https://youtu.be/bWc_-_DIFXA?t=105) to force OT in the first place. Kings win 176-175
* And of course, just the other night in Chicago, he [pulls up for an ice cold 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBA0ZhkLc1E) as the buzzer sounds to win 117-114.

The thing that really stands out to me: 6/7 game winners are on the road, a huge reason for the Kings' conference best road record of 21-13.

In addition to the 7 game-winners, he hit another 3 daggers, which I define as times where he hit the Kings' final FG of the win, followed only by Kings FTs on intentional fouls.

* 11/11 @ LAL, he [drains a turnaround fadeaway 2](https://youtu.be/1CQTw5I1qz0?t=432) with 0:32 to go
* 11/20 vs. Detroit, [he hits the two-point stepback](https://youtu.be/pMKX1-7jqa4?t=422) with 0:56 to go
* 1/20 vs. OKC, [he hit a layup to ice the game at 0:01](https://youtu.be/WMwjbMqEdls?t=437) (the Kings were already up 3 at the time, but it ended a flurry of OKC scoring)

Honorable mention for [assisting Trey Lyle's game-sealing dunk](https://youtu.be/cmhnaZDiwC8?t=561) with 0:37 to go @ Minnesota on 1/30.

A lot will depend on matchups. Would I place money on Denver or SAC beating a healthy Lakers or Warriors team in the first round? Hell no. At the same time, either of those teams could luck into facing Minnesota or OKC in the first round.

I can see Demar Derozan making a lot of noise if this hypothetical scenario were to happen but I don’t have the numbers to back that up. I’m solely judging based on style of play. Consequently, which player would take a free fall with this change?

But the refs have been abysmal this season.. I dont know what the solution is but from what I've seen this year, its time for a convo.

1) Consistency- They need to call the game according to the RULES. They called a travel on a Curry stepback yesterday that they rarely ever call. Its like the ref decided he didn't like Curry for one play. These players routinely travel and carry and the refs call it at their leisure. Gotta stop. 


2) Recognition of a foul- Hunter went up for a dunk last night and got hit 100% on the arm and ended up getting a tech. Ive seen this routinely all year long even when it helped my Hawks out. In fact, last night I saw multiple times where we body checked Curry and the ref called nothing. Blatent foul. Appreciate it this time refs. But enough is enough. When is a foul a foul every time?

3) Superstar calls. I recently saw an interview in which a player stated Kobe told him that "" you know they not calling a foul on me in the 4th quarter. "" The Shaq rules were another example. John Collins on our team gets hacked multiple times per game and they NEVER give him a whistle. He not a superstar.

358,Alex Caruso’s Defensive RAPTOR is the highest by a guard since the stat has been tracked,11umco0,"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nba-player-ratings/?player=Alex%20Caruso&season=2023

This season, Caruso’s DRAPTOR is +5.9, by far the highest in the league. The next closest is Anthony Davis at +5.2. 

Over the last nine seasons (the lifetime of the stat), only 3 guards crack the Top 30. 

Alex Caruso’s current season ranks 1st All-Time for guards, and 5th All-Time for all positions (1st and 2nd All-Time belong to Rudy Gobert) 

2nd place All-Time for guards again goes to Alex Caruso for the 2021-2022 season. 

3rd All-Time, and the only other guard in the Top 30 in DRAPTOR, is Tony Allen in the 2014-2015 season. Tony Allen was 33 at the time, so imo it’s very likely both him and Kobe Bryant would be the other guards near Caruso’s level if the stat covered all of the 2000s.

DeRozan left the Raptors as the all time leading scorer, but could never get the team over the hump in the postseason.

Since the trade in 2018, DeRozan has played for both the Spurs and the Bulls. He’s continued to play at an all star level, but his team(s) have not had success in the playoffs.

DeRozan: 49 points with 15/25 FGA, hits the game tying tough layup in the 4th and draws the sixth foul on Gobert with the and-1.

Lavine: 39 points with 15/25 FGA

The Bulls gets a tough win against the Wolves where Anthony Edwards was injured early in the game and Gobert foul out in OT.  Vucevic with a mid game but murders NAW on a ferocious dunk to seal the game.",Waikuku3,27,146,0.97

398,What’s next for the Pelicans?,11uc7mf,"They’ve been pretty horrific for the last 2-3 months, but they’ve hit rock bottom with a loss to the league-worst Rockets and their play-in chances look slimmer every day.

Basically every role player other than Trey Murphy (and Naji I guess) has regressed from last year. Zion has missed 2/3 of the season and a normal hamstring injury from January has dragged into something that might take him out the season. 

Even worse, it seems like they had a bright future before this season, but the season has been so poor even their future is questionable.

What’s next for them",legend023,51,24,0.88

400,Embiid in last 2 games vs Jokic: 41/14/5 on 68 TS%. Jokic: 23/11/9 on 68 TS%,11ubrka,"As much debate as there is about who is the best center in the league and who is MVP, I think there last 2 matchups have been interesting. Both have won one game a piece, but Embiid has outplayed Jokic H2H and visually looks like the better player with more dominant scoring and defense when they play each other. Embiid can defend and slow down Jokic much better than Jokic can defend Embiid.

In 7 games of his career vs Embiid, Jokic averages 22/8/7 on 60 TS%. Jokic is also 2-5 vs Embiid H2H. 

In 7 games vs Jokic, Embiid averages 26/12/4/2 on 57 TS%. Embiid is also 5-2 vs Jokic in his career. 

Their overall career matchups, shows Embiid outplays Jokic H2H and his team is also winning the matchup as well.

401,Who is the WORST player in the NBA that could take a 16 seed to a championship?,11ublft,"In honor of March Madness and FDU’s win over Purdue it got me thinking, who is the worst nba player that you could throw on the roster of a 16 seed in the ncaa tournament and expect them to win the title? I started thinking about this after someone asked if Giannis on a 16 seed would win the title on the Bucks’ sub (the answer was a resounding yes). I’m curious how bad of a player (by nba standards) could theoretically pull this off.",ahkallday,63,0,0.5
402,Whats the next great MVP race going to be?,11ubkgx,"So i think Giannis vs Embiid vs Jokic for the 3rd straight year is turning out to be one of the greatest MVP races of all time


Before this we had


Harden vs the world

Lebron vs KD

Shaq vs AI 

Lebron vs Kobe 



What players will be dueling it for MVP over the next few years?


Imo after this threesome i think Luka, Tatum, SGA will be having crazy races over the next few years",StormSaniWater,24,14,0.66

416,Finally it is clear to me. The secret to Steph Curry's success is that he never stopped shooting his little kid shot.,11u9kre,"I was always a bit confused by Wardell Stephen Curry II. He seems like a normal player, but he's the best shooter ever. Better than Bird, Reggie Miller, Ray Allen. But why? Usually you don't get to be the BOAT at something unless, beyond your determination, have some serious uncommon advantages. I was never sure what it was with him. But now I see. It's little kid power.

So... [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtYJTAsNmg), you can see Steph warming up with his Dad when he was a kid. Obviously, he's heaving the ball at the basket in one motion like you usually do when you're a kid and your forearm and wrist alone aren't strong enough to get the ball to the basket (and I guess you're shorter too and need more arc). 

I think for most of us, when we get to be around 14, we start shooting a normal ""adult"" two-motion shot, with just our arm. But now that I think about it, we really have to learn that shooting form from scratch at that age. So if you enter the NBA at 21, you have at most 7 years of reps with your jump shot.

But Steph Curry *never changed his form*. Apparently he started playing rec league games when he was 6-years-old. So when he went into the NBA, he actually had 15 years of reps. 8 extra years of practice.

On top of that, as we can see in the video, he was flinging NBA 3-pointers from the time he was a little kid too. When he was nowhere near strong enough in the arms to get it to the basket normally. So he learned to use his legs and arms in his shot to give extra power to his heave while not losing any control. Throwing the ball from beyond wrist-flick range is what he's ALWAYS been doing. It just so happened that when he got to be grown-man size, that same practice let him step back to 30-feet easily.

That is all. Maybe some of you already knew this. But I wanted to share anyway.",EGarrett,22,33,0.69
417,Moving Screens in the Paint,11u8ori,"These fake box outs that come way, way before the shot gets released need to be addressed, either by the rules committee or by making them a point of emphasis. There’s a lot of talk about the scoring explosion and what’s causing it, and I don’t think this gets brought up enough. The way games are called right now, bigs can seal the help defender and basically block them like an offensive lineman as their teammate takes the open layup. It’s a moving screen and it should be called. It’s gotten worse over the last few years but this year I feel like I’m seeing it on every drive.",jakehightower,11,27,0.85

>There’s multiple experiences: as an athlete, as a basketball player, as a regular civilian, as somebody who’s trying to start a business, as someone who’s trying to do things in the community. There’s not a lot of room for people of color, Black entrepreneurs, to come in and start a business. I think that my experience there has been not as fluid as I thought it would be.

But even with me being who I am, trying to start a business, trying to buy a house, trying to do certain things, you run into some adversity.

>**Other athletes have spoken about the negative way that fans have treated Black athletes while playing in Boston. Have you experienced any of that?**

>I have, but I pretty much block it all out. It’s not the whole Celtic fan base, but it is a part of the fan base that exists within the Celtic nation that is problematic. If you have a bad game, they tie it to your personal character.

>I definitely think there’s a group or an amount within the Celtic nation that is extremely toxic and does not want to see athletes use their platform, or they just want you to play basketball and entertain and go home. And that’s a problem to me.

445,Game #70 - Raptors vs Thunder: Post-Game Analysis,11tzxhz,"Hi r/NBA, I've mainly been using the r/torontoraptors sub to make these posts, mainly because this sub doesn't allow me to post individual pictures, but I think I've found bypass that through twitter pics. I'd like to test out one post here and see if you guys enjoy some in-depth analysis.

# Highlight of Game

Thankfully the Raptors made this one easy today:

[As Scottie is crossing the half you see him take a look back at Yak to signal to him to hustle up the floor. From the block to the no-look to the poster, this play felt like the Showtime Lakers.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/q1irc2keqboa1/player)

# Player of the Game 

I've been Pascal Siakam's biggest critic since the deadline, as he's had **4 games** where he's **scored 15 or less points** in March**,** having only 3 such games before this month.

He finally did a good job at reading the help defense, finishing with **25/14/8** with **4 threes.** Since the Raptors have been fully healthy, Siakam is the only starter with a **negative NET RTG.** He was a **+6** last night, playing a healthy **34 minutes** and being tagged with the responsibility of leading the bench. 

I had to give today's player of the game to **Pascal Siakam**. He needed this game, and I hope he's able to string along some good performances as we close the season out (or not and we win Wemby).

# How the game was put away

I thought the Raptors were always always in control of this game, holding a **9 point lead** until the **8 minute mark** of the 4th, where Scottie Barnes subbed back in and we simply put away the game, here are some plays that I thought contributed to it:

[Isaiah Joe tries to blow by Gary Trent Jr Twice, fails and takes a contested jumper.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/2ury9envtboa1/player)

I made a point that whether or not his offence is going, Gary needs to stay aggressive and effective defensively. The first time Joe drives Scottie is there to help in the paint while constantly looking at Giddey. This play also shows the presence of Yak presence defensively, the second time that Joe tried to drive, Poeltl sagged off his player to help Trent if Joe wanted to finish at the rim. 

When defended by Poeltl, attacking players shoot **37.6%** between **5-9 feet** so Joe technically did take a better shot, but this is still perfect defense by Trent Jr. Additionally, Poeltl contested a team-high **18 shots** and held opponents to a crazy **7/24** when defended by him.

[Scottie does a great job of recognizing the mismatch and sealing Shai down-low, if he postered Vucevic, I'm sorry Lu Dort you're getting postered too. ](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/xzwhf0lbwboa1/player)

Reddit only allows me 5 videos, so let me break this one down step-by-step:

* Scottie grabs and offensive rebound, gets the switch from Giddey to Shai
* Once Siakam gets the ball, they do a great job of moving the ball (and the Thunder do a great job rotating) to force the Thunder into more mismatches. 
* Both Fred and Gary had good shots that they usually take, but instead they find Poeltl on single coverage
* Scottie cuts to the basket, seals Shai (ref misses a foul with Shai wrapping his arms around Scottie)
* Easy dunk over Dort.

[Transition 3 and that's good night folks.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/9i73jlnuyboa1/player)

The Raptors get criticized a lot for help defense, deservedly so, but this is a perfect example of knowing when to help, and I want you to pay attention to Scottie Barnes' eyes defensively. As soon as Dort makes the pass his focus is on what Giddey is going to create.

Scottie realizes that Giddey has his head down and can only see the left side of the court, and comes over from the to help immediately. When Giddey spins, there's a surprise waiting for him. 

4 Thunder players collapse on Siakam in transition, and instead of forcing contact and trying to draw a foul, he uses the space to find Trent Jr , who shoots **40%** on **wide-open** **threes.**

These were the 3 plays that I thought put the game away but here are some other **4th quarter notes**:

* The Raptors held the Thunder to **0 field goals** for over a **4-minute stretch**
* We were **+7 on the glass** and **+16% shooting from the field** compared to them
* Siakam didn't force, he had **5 assists, 0 turnovers,** and only took **3 shots**
* Scottie and Poeltl dominated with **16/10/2** with **2 stocks**

# The Good, The Bad, No Ugly

I usually do 3 good things, 3 bad things, one ugly thing. But yesterday was genuinely one of the best games I've seen this team play and I really can't think of many bad things.

**5 Good Things**

1. Everyone chipped in. In 2020, the Raptors became the first team to have **5 or more players** average **15+ PPG** in a season. Well they did it again last year, and they're doing it again this year. They also did it last night, but instead had **6 players** who scored **15 points** or more. Poeltl has been averaging just under **15PPG** with the Raptors this year, so maybe they could become the first (?) team do have 6 players do it.
2. Nick Nurse did a great job of splitting Siakam and Scottie's minutes, which is something I know fans have been calling for. This season, they average over **29 MPG** together**,** and yesterday they only played **21 minutes** together, partly due to foul trouble with OG and Poeltl (it would've been closer to 17 minutes). Regardless I think it's key to split their minutes for spacing, specifically in single coverage isolations.
3. The Raptors are **2-0** since I've added the keys to the game section (I'll elaborate lol). After the game vs Denver I said the matchup between Scottie and OG vs Giddey and JDub  (Thunder fans, I absolutely love him, he's just about as good as OG was last year, be excited) is key. Scottie and OG: **37/12/7/1TO** on **14/24** from the **field,** **5 stocks** and a **+14** on the floor together. Giddey and JDub: **28/14/4/5TO** on **10/22** from the **field, 2 stocks,** and a **-9** on the floor together. All these players are awesome, and these two-man pairings will be key to these teams future success.
4. The Raptors dominated them on the glass and in transition. Outrebounding them by **20**, with **44 points in transition vs 19** for the Thunder. In addition **23 2nd chance PTs** to their **6.**
5. Scottie Barnes has absolutely been a mid-range monster in the Month of March, just take a look at his [shot chart](https://twitter.com/6ixin6ix_/status/1636753803822153728?s=46&t=qyM1qIw-Y3F7679x-MiQOw&fbclid=IwAR0tn_ZH0-htq3rCFnXDJYoKv9Dph5Le3PcCAP5GbNT5lL-oDZDzlo7PKaA). Here's a look at why he's dominating that right side mid-range:

[Please excuse the quality.](https://reddit.com/link/11tzxhz/video/jqtcqqwwbcoa1/player)

His length is problematic. Teams are used to him getting into the paint and going for a hook shot or fadeaway (like he did against Giddey in this clip) and they usually send help as he's been shooting **46%** on those shots from the free throw line range. His ability to create shots on islands where teams can't really help (without giving up a high quality shot off a pass) is going to be important for his offensive developments because teams can't double him on island iso's because of his playmaking ability.

**1 Bad Thing**

1. Precious Achiuwa, welcome to the dog house buddy :(

**One Ugly**

Nothing :)

# One Sentence Review, One Sentence Preview

**Review**

I really hope this team isn't playing with my emotions by pretending to be good for a few days and then fall off a cliff and never reach .500 this season.

**Preview**

Rudy Gobert, you're about to be put in a pick and roll torture chamber pal. 

# 3 Keys to Minnesota 

1. Attack Rudy Gobert off mismatches. Opposing teams shoot **56%** in the paint against him (both RA and non-RA). Against the Thunder I said managing the two-man game between Poeltl and whoever is running the PnR is important. We outscored The Thunder **30-10** on **points off screens.**
2. More Christian Koloko. He has the Raptors highest **NET RTG** this year, and it always confused me why Nick removed him from the rotation when he was our only center. I think placing him in a backup role where he can keep the defensive intensity that Poeltl brings is key going forward. He contested **7 shots** in only **12 minutes** yesterday.
3. Contain the two-man game of Conley and Gobert through effective switching and help. In wins the two of them combine for **30 PPG shooting 60% from the field.**  Whereas in losses they combine for **21 PPG shooting 48% from the field.**",eLevateAFFN,17,99,0.92
446,"If Nikola Jokic averages a triple-double this year, it will be exactly as rare to average a triple-double in a season, as it is to average 2+ blocks and 2+ steals in a season",11tzk4u,"Nikola Jokic is currently averaging 9.9 assists per game. If that number increases just a tiny bit the rest of the season, he will average a triple-double on the season.

**Triple-double seasons:**

Russell Westbrook (x4)  
Oscar Robertson (x1)  
potentially Nikola Jokic (x1)  

**2+ block / 2+ steal seasons:**

Hakeem Olajuwon (x4)  
David Robinson (x1)  
Gerald Wallace (x1)  

The triple-double is a sign of extreme versatility, generally on offense. The 2blk / 2stl in many ways could be considered the defensive version of it. Should Nikola Jokic join Russ and Big O, each statistical feat would have one player who has done it exactly 4 times, two players that have done it exactly once, and nobody else in league history.

454,Is Brook Lopez the 3rd best center in the league?,11txewa,"Hello r/nba,

At the center position the two obvious top dogs are Embiid and Jokic. However who is 3rd, in your minds? Traditionally this would be KATs spot but he’s been hurt all year. This got me thinking, there’s Bam, Brook, AD?, and Sabonis (is he a center or PF?). 

Bam is another great defensive center who has a nice offensive game (especially the middy he’s developed). 

Sabonis is a jokic-lite type offensive hub but bad defensively. 

AD is clearly better but his position is unclear, he’s constantly hurt, and plays with inconsistent effort. 

Then there’s Brook. Who’s better defensively than Bam and Sabonis (Bam is close he’s just not as good a rim protector). On par with AD defensively. Plus he’s a far better outside shooter, has a nice float game, is a good screen setter; etc. 

Where would you guys rank him at his position? Am I crazy for ranking him this high?

Edit: I may be undervaluing Bam. 90% of the time I watch him his matchup is Joel Embiid, which basically never goes his way. I may be overvaluing brook based on how he plays Embiid, which is better than anyone in the league at the moment.",Fun-Pass-5651,113,0,0.36

But I don't get this knowledge. Warriors brought Donte Divencenzo who is much more respected role player than GP2 was and he is shooting career high from three, they brought Jamychal Green who is a better player than Bjelica and OPJ and also shooting career high from threes. Warriors brought the players that can be replacements and they still struggle defensively. For wiggins case, they lost to alot of tanking teams on the road even with Andrew Wiggins on the road.

So I think there is other reason than missing old players. Their role players are good enough to replace players from last year. Is there chemistry issue because how Draymond punched JP?

> Riding a 12-game winning streak, the Bucks are only half a game behind the Celtics for first place, but they have benefited from a league-best 22-6 record in “clutch” games—and there’s no correlation between clutch performance in the regular season versus the playoffs. The Bucks’ point differential is also just plus-3.2 per game, which ranks only fourth in the East.

470,This will likely be the 4th consecutive year the NBA sets a new record for league wide free throw shooting.,11ttcur,"Here are the top 10 free throw shooting seasons in NBA history:

|**Rank**|**Season**|*FT%*|
:--|:--|:--|
|**1**|**2022-23**|*78.234%*|
|**2**|**2020-21**|*77.755%*|

|**9**|**2017-18**|*76.705%*|
|**10**|**2018-19**|*76.631%*|


The record set in 1974 stood for over 40 years before finally being broken in 2017. Each of the past 4 seasons have continued to improve upon that all-time mark. 

What are the reasons we are seeing such an all-time high in free throw shooting? It's the one shot in basketball that's been essentially unchanged for over 100 years. Are players league wide just now finding a way to improve their shooting form? Highly skilled free throw shooters getting to the line more? A small rule change that has somehow increased free throw shooting? Or something else entirely?",RecordReviewer,20,29,0.69

East seeding is more or less definitive, no team can jump more than 2 spots up, but the West is up for grabs between 4-12th. What do you guys think? Who goes on a run starting today?",thatdani,6,2,0.67
473,Joel Embiid Takes Over No. 1 Spot in Kia MVP Ladder: Is he the Favorite for the Award?,11tt0bb,"Joel Embiid has overtaken Nikola Jokic as the top MVP candidate according to the latest Kia MVP ladder rankings. Embiid's seven consecutive 30-point performances have helped him claim the top spot, while Jokic and the Denver Nuggets have struggled as of late. The betting odds have also shifted in Embiid's favor, with multiple sportsbooks making him the favorite to win the award.

Embiid's dominant performances have been a key factor in the Philadelphia 76ers' six-game winning streak, which has catapulted them into the top four of the Eastern Conference. His latest performance against the Cleveland Cavaliers included 36 points and 18 rebounds, while also sparking a controversial call that went in his favor.

While Giannis Antetokounmpo remains a threat at No. 3 on the ladder, Embiid's recent form has put him in prime position to win his first MVP award. However, as the race for playoff seeding heats up, there is no guarantee that Embiid will maintain his current form or status as the favorite for the award.

So, what do you think? Is Embiid the clear frontrunner for MVP, or will someone else make a late surge and claim the award? Let's discuss in the comments below.",Tainted_One_4ever,116,0,0.48

482,How far away from the basket did Jerry West shoot most of his jumpers?,11tonse,"Jerry West is rightfully regarded as one of the best shooters to ever play the game. However, he never played with a three point line and it would be unfair to compare him to other great shooters  who played with the 3 point line. 

Among those who had the chance to watch him play live, heard stories from people who saw him play live, or watched several highlights of his, how far away from the basket did he usually pull up from? How good was his range?

&#x200B;

Did he attempt most of his jumpers from...

1) Demar DeRozan, CP3, SGA Range (free throw line area, on the elbows, around the painted area)

2) LaMarcus Aldridge Range (Top of the key, between the free throw and three point line)

Obviously you can argue that it's not the perfect formula but it clearly is a strong indicator of how good of a season a player had and whether MVP voters use it or it just happens to coincide with where the MVP votes go, it's hard to argue that the criteria keeps changing when this has been a very consistent indicator on who ends up winning MVP.

485,West Predictions,11tjjns,"As the East seems like it is very top heavy with the surging bucks, the still very good albeit sometimes limping Celtics, and a very strong sixes, the West seems WIDE open.

The nuggets for the most part seem like the best team in the conference from wire to wire, albeit with some losses strung together lately

Grizzlies, although in near the top, are without Morant for 9 games, it'll be interesting to see if chemistry is an issue or they slip from a top spot

The KINGS?!?! Talk about a Cinderella season, they could very well finish #2 or #3, and possibly make the world end by making it to the finals Ala the 2021 sun's (Ling playoff drought snapped,  followed by a run through the conference)

The Warriors are very jekyll and Hyde on the home vs road, but are hovering in that top 6 spot and do have the experience of long playoff runs

The Clippers seem inconsistent and can't string together too any wins together, but still hover in that top 6

The Sun's got KD, it's all a matter of making that chemistry work and surging to the top half of the conference 

There is a very real possibility we will see a first time finals appearance from a team coming out of the West. With about 10 games to go, who do you think can make it out and why?

Personally I wanna see the world end and the Kings make it",Fearless-Muffin,11,4,0.57
486,"Kawhi Leonard was first named an All-Star in 2016. Since 2016, he has been named All-NBA First Team 3 times. Kevin Durant has only been named All-NBA First team once in this time frame, the season Kawhi played 9 games. Why does Kawhi not get the credit KD does?",11tj50c,"Kawhi was also the DPOY in 2016, All-Defensive First Team twice, and All-Defensive Second Team three times.

When most people talk about the top players of this generation they bring up LeBron, Steph, Durant, and Giannis. Nothing wrong with those players but I often wonder why Kawhi’s name isn’t mentioned. Most people talk about Kawhi like he just takes it easy until the playoffs and then turns it on but clearly the voters think he has outperformed KD as a regular season player since he has become a star.

Here are their playoff stats from 2016 to now:

Kawhi (70 games): 28-8-4-2-1 62.9 ts%

487,Why was Kareem not seen as a better player than Russell and Wilt in the past?,11tj0bi,"Up until somewhat recently (2010s ish) it was widely considered by fans and the media that both Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain were seen as greater players than Kareem Abdul Jabbar. Not saying it's wrong or right but now Kareem as top 3 is pretty unanimous around here 

What was the cause behind that? Was it because Kareem peaked in a weak era? Was it because of his playstyle that wasn't very flashy (other than the skyhook)? Was it his personality which rubbed a lot of the media the wrong way, or his politics? Why was Kareem slept on before",lowercase-punishment,63,12,0.66
488,"Asking for criteria in MVP voting shows you lack a basic understanding of what voting represents. Also, there should absolutely be a different narrative every year for MVP.",11tj0b5,"I don't understand what the criteria are for MVP anymore. Every time someone says this phrase I feel second-hand embarrassment. If we picked NBA MVP based on criteria we would just check all the necessary boxes and be done with it. Voting is redundant if we use criteria to decide something. The only criteria an NBA player has to fulfil to be an NBA MVP candidate is, well to play in the NBA.  

Voting always is, should and will be subjective, objective, and biased depending on the voter. There may be guidelines for voting but there cant be criteria. What are the criteria when voting for US President? You can't be serious and tell me that the last 4 presidents all checked the same boxes. What are the criteria when voting for Miss Universe or Eurosong or anything else that we vote on? Voting is not grading.

And every NBA season is a unique story that will never be told again. Different obstacles to overcome and different motivations for every single player and team. It's only logical that the narrative for MVP voting will be different.",Streptomicin,34,26,0.61

511,Would the 2018 Rockets offense still be as effective today?,11te6gk,"As most of us would know, the Houston Rockets were a dominant force in 2018 that were plagued by unfortunate injuries, and their simple yet effective offense of running isolations and pick and rolls for Harden and CP3 in a pure 5-out system played a huge part in their basketball dominance. 

However, I'm curious as to whether or not it would work today? Most teams in the league have incorporated heavy off-ball movement and screening into their offensive systems. While the 2018 Rockets were not bereft of any off-ball movement whatsoever, their 5-out system was enough to give Harden and CP3 the space they needed to operate in. 

Would this offensive system work today? If so, is it not being employed by more teams because of a lack of personnel?",Izrezar,43,17,0.78
512,Will Domantas Sabonis make an All-NBA team this year?,11te60a,"I've always felt that Sabonis has been a bit underrated for a while. But with the Kings playing so well, and with the numbers Sabonis is posting up, I think he has a great shot of making all-NBA. 

Embiid and Jokic have the first and second team Center spots locked up (In no particular order), so that just leaves one spot open for the third team. Sabonis' biggest competition for this spot would be Bam Adebayo, and while Bam is a better defender, All-NBA focuses more on offense, where Sabonis is superior. 

He's posting up 19/12/7, and is essentially a triple double threat as a Center/Forward hybrid. Moreover, he has been hyper efficient this season, shooting over 60% of the field with an impressive 67% TS. 

So with all of this being said, do you think Sabonis makes All-NBA this year? And as a bonus question, do you think he's a top 3 center in the NBA, surpassing KAT?",Varolyn,104,187,0.96

520,"If Denver continues to struggle defensively and Kings lose their 3&D man Kevin Heurter, doesn't that make 7-10 seed more desirable?",11td3w4,"Denver recently struggled from defense and lost to tanking/play in teams 4 games straight. Their bench has been horrific and trades that they made(Bones, Thomas Bryant) were meaningless. Even though Jokic scores 35 points in 80% shooting, team somehow manages to lost based on their horrible defense from MPJ and Murray and turnovers. If their 3 point shooting goes cold in the playoffs, they have no way but put jokic for 45 minutes in a game

Kings are a legitimate contender I must admit, but losing Kevin can be huge. He has been their reliable 3 point shooter and losing him can be huge on offensive end. Also, I am not sure if they can keep up their hot streak from 3 point line and Fox actually performing in the playoffs.

Thats the 1st and 2nd seed in the west. For 3rd to 6th seed, except for the grizzlies who are mentally out of the control, all of them are legitimate title contenders like clippers, suns(not w/o KD), warriors.

Maybe for the west, getting play in spot might better than facing 3rd to 6th seed in the first round",junahn,44,0,0.21

You also have Alex Poythress, Archie Goodwin, Willie Cauley-Stein, and Nerlens Noel that could round out the 15 man roster. 

Now I know it's not just as easy as adding up their win shares, but if you do so, that team ends up with around 23 wins.  While certainly not great, that's still more wins than the Bobcats or Magic ended up with that season. Plus if you look at those same players win shares for the following season (not even including any players they would have picked up in the draft), they are probably a playoff team. 

*Technically Enes never played at Kentucky because he was ruled ineligible due to payments he received as a pro player in Europe, but I'm including him here anyway because he was a Calipari recruit that signed with Kentucky and IMO still counts in this made-up hypothetical scenario.",RecordReviewer,12,0,0.29

* Denver and Mavs need to figure out their teams around Jokic and Doncic. Those are the stars with the most assists per game, so they may be more important to their teammates as playmakers.

2016: 30ppg, 5rpg, 7apg on 67%TS and 11 3PTA per game

2021: 32ppg, 5rpg, 6apg on 66%TS and 13 3PTA per game

2022: 26ppg, 5rpg, 6apg on 60%TS and 12 3PTA per game

2023: 30ppg, 6rpg, 6apg, on 67%TS and 11 3PTA per game

2016-2023 is 8 Seasons and he’s put up similar production in all the seasons without KD except last season, in which he dominated on the way to a ring anyway.

So my question is, do you think it would’ve been possible to see this version of Steph for all those seasons if KD never joined? If so, do you think Steph would’ve gotten more respect from the public and media versus what he gets now? He’s a universal top 10 to 15 player already but it’s kind of wild to me to think about what it would’ve looked like if Durant never did join Golden State.",DrunkPirateHunter,21,0,0.32

# How did the models fare for the 2023 All-Star game?

In case you were wondering how the models did for the All-Star game, I had run the models on February 4. Of the 31 players with at least a 0.5 probability, 3 did not play enough games (AD, Harden, Booker) and predictably missed, 3 were predicted to make it but did not (Jimmy Butler, Trae Young, Darius Garland), and the other 25 made it. With 27 total All-Star selections, the unlikely All-Stars were Jrue Holiday and Jaren Jackson Jr.

# Notes

1. This is a model to predict likelihood (either they make it or they don't), and the order was constructed based on their likelihood. Therefore, ordering the players like so may be a fundamentally flawed concept, but it's still interesting to see what results come out.

2. By ""simple"" and ""widely available,"" the statistics used are pace-adjusted PPG, RPG, APG, Steals + Blocks per game (SBPG), relative true shooting (rTS), WS/48, and team W/L %. I know WS/48 is oft-maligned for various reasons and there may be some autocorrelation happening as a result, but it seems to provide some extra dimension of information and avoids the use of WS, BPM, VORP, etc.

3. I was the one making the teams work positionally, so if you have any complaints about the positional placements of players, blame me, not the machine.

4. Embiid, Jokic, and Giannis were a strong top 3 with little separation. It's worth noting that this is not a model made to predict the MVP so I wasn't trying to differentiate between them. Embiid and Jokic are effectively interchangeable for the purposes of making the teams.

5. Jaren Jackson Jr. has a probability of 0.289, and it was around here (0.287) for All-Star voting as well. Seems like the model doesn't have enough info to evaluate his 4.1 stocks per game, or possibly, high steals/blocks counts have more frequently belonged to big men who otherwise weren't good enough to make the All-Star/All-NBA game (see: early Gobert, Whiteside, Drummond, Myles Turner, Mitchell Robinson, etc.).

6. In descending order of probability (0.75+): Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, James Harden, Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Donovan Mitchell, Stephen Curry, Ja Morant, Damian Lillard, Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler, De'Aaron Fox, Domantas Sabonis, Julius Randle, Pascal Siakam

7. After them (0.60-0.72): Trae Young, Darius Garland, Paul George, Jrue Holiday, Lauri Markkanen, Jalen Brunson, Anthony Edwards, DeMar DeRozan, Kristaps Porzingis, Tyrese Haliburton, Bam Adebayo.

8. The model predicts **either** All-Star **or** All-NBA appearances, so the 60% or higher being 7 out of 11 (63.6%) All-Stars seems to line up. None of them figure to be solidly in the All-NBA conversation.

9. Fox has been one of the strongest climbers over the last month, so with Ja missing games due to suspension, Fox may pass him and/or Dame. There is still a significant gap to be crossed though, so he's more likely to make it if Ja misses so many games it dents his resume.

584,Did the big 3 Miami Heat underachieve and are they overrated?,11so04z,"Over the past few weeks I’ve seen people constantly say they underachieved, To me no they didn’t. Some people think they should’ve went 4/4 some think 3/4 but it’s hard to win 1 ring let alone back 2 back. Obviously they should’ve won in 2011 but we know how that went but 4 finals in 4 years with 2 rings, 27 game winning streak(3rd all time) and a 66-16 win record(franchise record). That’s not underachieving(unless you genuinely thought they were gonna win 8 rings😂😂😂)

Are they overrated?
It seems they get overrated simply bc of lebron and the he only wins with stacked teams thing. Once 2013 hit you can tell both Dwade and bosh were starting to regress due to injury and dwades knees having constant fluid in them. The team was good don’t get me wrong but outside the big 3 the team was mid asf. The 4th best player was Mario chalmers in 2012. In 2013 the 4th option was 37 year old ray Allen(maybe Mario again). 2014 same thing. In the playoffs it was contagiously lebron only performing in the last 2 years. I feel like I’m gonna get flack for this but Dwade and bosh were horrendous in each pacers series and even with lebron masterclass performances the team would still lose cause Dwade is shooting 3-16 or bosh is shooting 1-8 yes injuries but it just seems weird how they would be hot garbage come the ecf/finals in 2013/2014

601,Curry has the worst whistle for a superstar ever,11sjmby,"Just saw it live sry. Ivica Zubac gets a finger on his back and gets 2 FTs. Curry gets hacked by Zubac, Plumlee and Kawhi endlessly, 0 calls. Warriors get 0 FTs in 3rd quarter.",Unique-Warning7798,201,231,0.6
602,"For the first time this season, Joel Embiid is the odds-on betting favorite to win MVP",11sjkr7,"https://www.rotowire.com/betting/nba/mvp-odds.php

Although plenty of Redditors, members of the media, and fans have argued about Embiid/Jokic/Giannis and the MVP award for three years now, betting markets have been incredibly reluctant to pick Joel Embiid as the favorite to win MVP. Jokic survived losing to the Sixers earlier in the season to become the heavy favorite for months, and even survived recent losses amidst unparalleled success from Embiid. Until tonight. For the first time all season (and probably since midway through last season) Joel Embiid is the betting favorite to win MVP.

Embiid: +115
Jokic: +130 (he’s not far behind)
Giannis: +350

No one else is close.

This is the first time it’s ever felt truly wide-open to me — Vegas never lies.",Professor_Finn,144,162,0.8
603,"[Hoffman} Joel Embiid: ""I didn't think I had extended anything. I watch basketball every day. And based on the way, those are officiated — We got some guys that basically play like running backs in this league that get that call all the time — I was pretty confident.""",11siy47,"Lmfao I love this. He's also right, if he's watching film of how Giannis is officiated it's not a crazy assumption to assume that's a legal move for him to pull off. Also you can tell he's definitely on social media daily from the the running back reference.

604,Kevin Huerter post All Star break,11situe,"After dropping the lowest amount of points(8) in the 3 point All Star shooting contest Kevin Huerter promised he come back and improve. True to his word he shot the 3 point ball at 37/74 exactly 50%, over the past 11 games since the break Including a personal record of 8- 3 pointers in a loss against the Bucks Monday. The Kings are 9-2 in those games. 

In addition his middy is surprisingly good, he can get to the basket with relative easy, and his PnR with Sabonis is excellent. Overall a solid pickup last season to surround Sabonis with shooters. Really happy with his contribution to the Kings.",Zhekadub,19,150,0.97

618,Postseason Reformatting,11shlvb,"For some reason, it bothers me how the NBA playoffs are divided geographically. Look at the NFL and MLB and you could have a New York-Boston Final, or an all Los Angeles Final, if they are good enough to make it. That’s probably because those 2 leagues were themselves merged from other leagues and the championship is AFC (former AFL) and NFC (older NFL); the World Series used to literally be 2 leagues fighting it out. 

For the NBA (and NHL, as the scheduling is similar), the regular season formula is fine: travel is hard, and you should play more games against your division to limit it.

However, for the playoffs, they should seed teams 1-16, irregardless of conference, and have a 4-round bracket that leads to the Finals. Maybe the 2 best teams are in the same conference and they should meet in the last round, not in earlier rounds simply because they are East or West.

Idk. It’s probably never going to happen but it just bothers me",Local_Stay4957,7,0,0.38

Whether you want to blame the incompetent medical staff for such a ridiculous decision, or Jeanie for refusing to sign a 10 day big man for money reasons despite having no available centers (they knew this weeks in advance), one thing is certain and that is that the Lakers front office is still arguably the worst in the league.

635,The Most Consistently Productive Stat Sheet Stuffers (Game Score),11sdmb1,"Game score is a player evaluation metric which can be considered John Hollinger's simple and linear version of the Player Efficiency Rating. Game Score does not make any adjustments like PER does for team pace.

An ""average"" Game Score is considered 10, while 40 is considered a fantastic Game Score.

Listed here are the 42 most consistent players at producing a game Score at 10 or higher. 42 players was used because of the cutoff at 80% of games doing so.

How to read:

Player: X/Y (percentage)

X = the number of games that the player has produced a Game Score of at least 10. Y = the total number of games the player has played. I have done some manual work and subtracted games where players did not produce a high Game Score and played under 20 minutes, because this is an accumulation statistic (all-in-one box score) and in games where players were injured it did not feel fair to penalize their percentage. However we are counting games under 20 minutes where they produced a Game Score of at least 10 because that means they were efficient in a short time and it feels like this should be rewarded for this list.

The list is ordered by players who most frequently posted a Game Score of 10 or higher relative to the number of games they played.

641,Bucks without Giannis: 9-6. 76ers without Embiid: 9-4,11sc11m,"It is worth noting 11-6 for Giannis may be more appropriate since he left 2 games early.

76ers are also 5-2 with Harden but no Embiid. They've beat much better teams as well. They beat the Kings without Harden and Embiid and beat the Nets with both Kyrie and Harden.

The only .500+ quality team the Bucks have beat without Giannis is the Heat when he left early. They technically beat two other teams above .500 (Suns and Nets). However, the Nets played their entire bench that game and the Suns have a losing record post KD trade in games he doesn't play (which that was one of them).

Bucks win percentage without Giannis is 65% (using 11-6). With him it is 76%.

76ers are at 69% without Embiid. They are at 67% with him.

Point is: The entire narrative that Giannis somehow has so much more help and that his team is still so good without him just seems wrong. Don't get me wrong, the Bucks supporting cast is great and they complement Giannis extremely well but without him they aren't as equipped to win as the 76ers. Harden can run the offense much better than anyone on the Bucks and the 76ers have much better options in terms of guys that can create shots for themselves and others. If Middleton was his normal 33 MPG 20+ PPG self it might be a different discussion but for this season it seems very clear the 76ers have been clearly better without their star than the Bucks. Which is not what the narrative is.

11,Traveling: A Closer Look at an Underrated Skill,11xnwbk,"Greetings, fellow NBA enthusiasts. 

Today, we will delve into a topic that is often overlooked in the game of basketball - traveling. While dribbling is undoubtedly a crucial skill, let us not underestimate the strategic benefits of traveling.

Recent research has shown that when a player takes a few extra steps, they can cover more ground and reach the basket faster, thus increasing their chances of scoring. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Sports Sciences found that traveling can result in a higher field goal percentage, especially for taller players.

Moreover, traveling can create unpredictability on the court and throw off defenders, making it an effective offensive strategy. This is because defenders are conditioned to anticipate certain movements, and traveling can provide a surprising element to the game.

In terms of turnovers, which are a concern for any basketball player, dribbling carries a higher risk than traveling. This is because when a player is dribbling, the ball is exposed to potential theft by the opposing team. In contrast, traveling only results in a turnover if it is detected by the referees, which is not always the case.

Even some of the greatest players in NBA history, such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, have used traveling to their advantage, often in the form of the ""Eurostep"" maneuver. LeBron James is also known for his impressive strides before a dunk, which demonstrates the power of traveling in creating scoring opportunities.

In conclusion, while dribbling is undoubtedly an essential skill in basketball, it is important to recognize the potential advantages of traveling. Research has shown that traveling can lead to higher field goal percentages, create unpredictability, and reduce the risk of turnovers. 

So the next time you see a player take a few extra steps, remember the science behind the skill.",simocm11,13,0,0.24

21,"When Kareem retired, he was top 20 all-time in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.",11xkxls,"Here is where Kareem ranked all-time in the 5 main counting stats when he retired at the end of 1988-89 season:

|Stat|Total|Kareem Rank|
:--|:--|:--|
|Points|38,387|1st|
|Rebounds|17,440|3rd|
|Assists|5,660|14th|
|Steals|1,160|19th|
|Blocks|3,189|1st|

Couple caveats with this is that the NBA didn't start officially recording steals and blocks until the 1974-75 season, so there would have been plenty of guards that had more steals than Kareem. Wilt and Russell would have been 1/2 in blocks, but Kareem did end up 1st in blocks despite missing out on them counting his first 4 seasons, so he might have retired 1st in blocks anyway. 

With all that said, I didn't realize he had racked up so many assists over his career. We often remember Wilt and Walton as being great passing centers from the 60's and 70's, but Kareem was no slouch either when it came to dishing the rock. At 7'2"", he's still the tallest player to ever average 5+ assists for a season (according to basketball reference heights at least).

&nbsp;

LeBron was the next player I though of when I looked up Kareem's stats, but due to playing in a different era, and the league having 75 years worth of seasons for other players to rack up big numbers, his ranks don't quite stack up to Kareem. Here is where LeBron currently ranks all-time in the 5 core counting stats:

|Stat|Total|LeBron Rank|
:--|:--|:--|
|Points|38,450|1st|
|Rebounds|10,606|32nd|
|Assists|10,371|4th|
|Steals|2,180|9th|
|Blocks|1,067|91st|

Still really impressive, but just in a different light. Depending on when Chris Paul retires, LeBron will finish either 3rd or 4th in assists and will still hold the all-time scoring record, which is just bananas to think about in the context of literally any other player's skill set all-time.",RecordReviewer,16,21,0.82

Harden is averaging 22/11/6 on the team with the second best record in the league. Philly currently sits at 48-22.

While this would normally be a shoo-in for not just an All-Star selection but a juicy All-NBA team as well, Harden was snubbed from All Star team. He was passed up for the likes of:

* Jrue Holiday (19/7/5)
* Tyrese Haliburton (21/10/4)
* Pascal Siakam (24/8/5)
* Demar Derozan (25/5/5)

who all made the team despite either having significantly worse stats or playing on a significantly worse team, or both.

All-NBA teams are more selective than the All-Star team due to having 37.5% less spots, so it's highly unlikely Harden will be rewarded with an All-NBA spot either.

I scoured hundreds player stats across dozens of seasons to see if I could find another season similar to the one Harden's having now, where a player is elite yet didn't collect a single award.

The closest I could find was **Damian Lillard's 2017 season**. Dame averaged 27/6/5, but Portland went just 41-41 and barely squeaked into the postseason. I believe the difference in record pushes it in favor of 2023 Harden.

Is anyone aware of a better ""no award"" season than the one Harden is having right now?",MarshalMichelNey1,18,0,0.43
39,[OC] Can't get the Wynne: the Sixers' struggles in their City Edition jerseys,11x92pa,"[Two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/11kxyge/oc_the_agony_and_the_ecstasy_embiid_plays_amazing/) I looked at Embiid's amazing stats in the Sixers' City edition jerseys, and the team's mediocre win-loss record in the same games. 

After two more games (a [win against the Wizards](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202303120PHI.html) and tonight's [loss against the Bulls](https://www.nba.com/watch/video/full-focus-bulls-snap-sixers-winning-streak-in-double-overtime)) nothing has changed - Embiid's average stats are still crazy playing at home in the jerseys (40 points, 11 boards, 4 assists, 0.86 steals and 2.7 blocks), he is a cumulative +40 in those games, and the Sixers have only won three of the seven, despite winning 70% of their home games for the season.

Miami are the last team to play them in these jerseys, three days before the end of the regular season on April 6. Mark your calendars (or don't - this is still a pretty small sample size, even if it's weird their home record is so much worse in these jerseys than out of them).",Mackinaw,1,7,0.69
40,Taurean Prince had the most efficient 30 point game in at least 40 years,11x7ig4,"EDIT: upon double checking Davis Bertans holds this title. He had a game in February 2021 vs the Nuggets where he scored 35 points, shooting 9-11 from the field, all 3’s and a perfect 8-8 at the line, good for a 121 TS% statmuse gave me the wrong information, apologies. However this game was played in an empty gym with no fans which made shooting *a lot* easier in many instances. Plus it’s still a historically efficient game for prince so worth the post imo

35 points on just 13 shots and 4 free throws 119 true shooting. 

Statmuse only tracks TS% going back to the 1982-1983 season but having TS% well over 100 like this was basically impossible before 3 pointers. 

Prince beats out Richie Frahm who scored 31 points on 11 shots December 20th 2003, for a mere 117 true shooting, he averaged just 3 points and didn’t score more than 17 any other game that season, or his entire career for that matter. He never averaged more than 4 PPG and was a journeymen at best. Prince is arguably a journeyman himself and has had a much better career. Somewhat similarly. prince’s season high was just 19 before his 35 point outburst tonight.

Frahm statline: 31 points, 10-11 from the field, 6-7 from 3, 5-5 at the line

Prince statline: 35 points, 12-13 from the field, 8-8 from 3, 3-4 at the line

If I was forced to predict someone to break this record I would go with Isaiah Joe. Elite shooter who mostly will just shoot 3’s, can easily have a game where he goes like 8 for 9 from deep, but won’t mess up his efficiency by taking any stupid 2’s.",AdviceEuphoric4852,32,215,0.94
41,"Since the All-Star break, Utah Jazz rookie Walker Kessler has been the league leader in blocks per game with 3.8 BPG. He is averaging an entire block per game more than the DPOY favorite Brook Lopez (2.8).",11x7h4m,"Kessler has been sensational, and while he won't get true ROTY considerations, he definitely deserves to be in the conversation as a third party. The impact of him on defense is so big that in a weird sense, it has almost made me forget that he's a rookie because I take it so for granted. He looks very polished defensively. 

A notable fact to mention, if post-Allstar break is too small of a sample size for some reason, is that Kessler is 2nd in BPG since the turn of the calendar year (2.9 since January 1st) behind Jaren Jackson Jr.'s 3.0 BPG. He is 4th on the entire season, behind JJJ, Claxton, and Brook Lopez. He is a rookie. Future DPOY?

44,"With the Kings' loss, the Grizzlies have regained the 2nd seed!",11x5vez,"Despite Ja's suspension, they went 6-3 in those games. The next two games are against the Rockets in Memphis. Will the Kings be able to get it back?",Traditional_Brief806,59,81,0.77
45,NBA Related Data Science Project,11x5uqp,"Hey everyone, I have been a fan of the NBA for a while and I am looking for some ideas for a data science project that is centred around that. I plan on using a Bayesian framework and if I can come up with an interesting question with appropriate data, hope to employ a hierarchical model. 

I have some ideas of what I can look into, but also wanted to make this post and see if any of you guys have any interesting ideas? Maybe some NBA fan data scientists in here who have a question but don't have the time to explore it? Let me know what you guys think of the following brief snippets:

&#x200B;

1. I came across the topic of 2 for 1 possessions which peeked my interest. A 2 for 1 possession is a strategy used during the last minute of the quarter or period. This strategy is done by timing a shot to make sure that the team that has the possession of the ball can regain possession and have enough time to shoot again. They are somewhat polarizing, with some thinking that the strategy is very poor because the play is often rushed and the team ends up taking a bad shot for the sake of a 2 for 1. Is it really better to take 2 potentially poor shots versus 1 good shot? Are certain types of shots (i.e. a three pointer vs midrange vs layup) better to perform with 2 for 1s in mind? Not sure what other factors or predictors I can come up with but, but that is the idea. I would also need to figure out how I would quantify the ""effectiveness"" of a 2 for 1 possession, or where I could even find such data. 
2. The effect of a team's offensive/defensive rating and its players offensive/defensive ratings. Obviously there is correlation there, but I think it may be interesting to look into player transfers and the effect over time.  How does a player's defensive rating change from before they joined the team to when they have been with the team for a bit? Are more highly defensive rated teams better at developing a players defensive rating, or is it more about the player's own training regiment. Does having better defenders on your team, make you a better defender? Unsure about what covariates I can use to construct a model here, but this framework may lend itself nicely to something hierarchical? Team level stats having effect on player level stats.
3. Player misutalization. There are instances in basketball where one player is doing really well, then they get traded to a new team with a different play style, and suddenly they are ""terrible"". This isn't necessarily because they player suddenly became worse, but because the new team isn't employing the player in plays or setting up in a way that leverages that players strengths. Sometimes teams realize that, make some technical adjustments and the player is suddenly playing really well again. I think it would be interesting to explore this further. Again not sure about how to set up a model or find data that would let me do some analysis. I would also need to see if there us some data on ""player strengths"". Maybe the response here can be some simple production statistics, like player plus/minus while the predictors are things like the type of play, the players strengths, interaction between the two, etc. 
4. A more simplistic idea is salary predictions based on various other stats like number of games played, points per game, winshares, injury proneness, etc. A bit simple and boring in my opinion, but maybe could discover something unexpected. Results could be used to forecast what a free agent may expect to be paid for their next contract or what to work on to increase that number the quickest.",BlackCoatBrownHair,13,19,0.88

84,Why don't NBA defenses defend Giannis the way they do Steph Curry?,11wyulu,"ok it sounds ridiculous but hear me out. 

In the recent analysis involving the play where Giannis trucks Craig, it's deemed that the defender is not in legal guarding position. But instead of defenders playing this game of trying to draw charges and and ""build a wall"", why not do the opposite? why not just stay inside his jersey the whole game and never let him build up momentum?

Giannis starts running from the opposite three point line, by the time he gets into the defenders space, you're cooked. But imagine instead a defender just stayed within a few feet of him the whole game and never let him comfortably start running, or recieve passes.

Giannis isn't a 3 level scorer, he's not going to hit you with step back 3s and elbow pull up middys. Hes not going to hit you with nasty crossovers and get to open space. Hes not going to take you to the block and hit you with dream shakes and turn around hooks off the glass. 
The defender doesn't even need to be elite, they just have to reasonably stay in front of Giannis and prevent him from comfortably building momentum. 

Idk the last 5 years of trying to build walls and draw charges has resulted in him giving you 40/15 every night.  Am I crazy to think it's time to try a different approach?",HitboxOfASnail,51,0,0.4

98,[OC] Film Analysis on the Misuse of AD Offensively,11wt54w,"So through out a lot of AD's tenure on the Lakers, specifically this year, I feel like the team has done a pretty poor job of running the offense through AD and I decided to try and break down some recent film to look more into it. He makes plenty of mistakes so this post isn't attempting to absolve blame, but more just give constructive criticism to how he's being used offensively. Because of this I'm gonna focus on taking somewhat rare examples of the Lakers making smart decisions around AD to point out what they should do more often rather than just posting low lights

&#x200B;

Very curious for other's thoughts on what I'm suggesting they do more of, if you think the analysis is fair, or if you think you have even better ideas on how the team should be utilizing Davis

&#x200B;

PS This is my first time doing this so I'm very open to constructive criticism as there's at least a chance I'll try and do more stuff like this in the future

&#x200B;

Lets start with some examples of lack of off ball movement:

&#x200B;

[In this clip](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxPNDeyidPFfWSE3UPqYm8yFeW5xsw_KIz) you see the entire defense focused on him. Rui cuts to the middle of the paint but he cuts to a place where there's no open passing lane, but there's no meaningful movement on offense and it leads to a lazy iso jumper.

&#x200B;

[In this one](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxIUQdBUcwgAtQ67d3JizXFPvH1fGhV0YW) you see something somewhat similar with vando cutting to the middle, AD being doubled with  every player looking at him. He misses the shot but the lack off off ball movement just makes it incredibly easy for the defense to focus on him while cutting off passing lanes.

&#x200B;

Now if you watch the Lakers you've seen a ton of plays like this, especially since the raptors spent most of the game selling out to stop AD recently. The rest of the team stepped up in that game and punished the raptors for their scheme but as teams replicate the strategy its made the holes in the rest of the lakers offense much more clear. I'm not gonna spam a bunch more clips like the two before, but just wanted to give you examples of how the lakers offense running through AD is often just getting AD in iso and hoping he can beat a double/triple (which is obviously a terrible way to run an offense).

&#x200B;

Dibble hand off (aka DHO) potential:

&#x200B;

[Here](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx-FCN3q1vHLzKHTyWmtszJHOymzP0yTTd) you see  a DHO between AD and Reaves where ADs defender drops, reaves defender picks him up giving reaves a solid look. Not only this but Brown Jr's defender slides to reaves creating a wide open 3 on top of everything else

&#x200B;

[Plays like that](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxxigNpGj6clRkEU-O6xS2IQ9cQCftrvZv) open up opportunities like this where you can get Davis in single coverage once again because the defense has to respect his teammates on some level

&#x200B;

[Now after you've](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxSGzM7VkY8REtP5Rs2yezTzCF-CidhDup) established the threat of that it leads to plays where teams have to respect it, once again giving the best player on the team easy looks

&#x200B;

Off Ball cuts:

&#x200B;

[AD isn't jokic](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxEqO6IaSztQpJMT-SLXFuwp-9y1e2Cchn) but there are 100% ways you can set him up for easy passes to help create shots for others like this. 

&#x200B;

[Cutting more even when AD isnt the focal point of the play can open up](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxpVPgfUYDfXjXFJQyoeBX2gIMwjES0wxN) shots for him as well. He can be very effective off ball, and the more you can do stuff like this the harder it is for a coach to solely rely on swarming him

&#x200B;

Guard Screen potential:

&#x200B;

[Here](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxiRO1YGg_KN-fCncgBWwE0YjPgagQQ0TO) you have Beasley screen for Davis setting him up to take a midrange jumper. As we all know this isnt the exact spot you want AD shooting, but its so much better than what you see far too often -- him being swarmed with no one working to get open, often resulting in far worse jumpers

&#x200B;

[He misses this](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxnCLE2Zr9YKIITM-OLTE53U0YbatzgGPa) and once again its not ideal but seeing them try something like this is still an improvement over a lot of their stagnant possessions

&#x200B;

Id love to see them explore using guards as screeners off ball too when AD has the ball to create open shots for shooters while AD is posted up with the ball. Opening up a couple good shots for him to easily pass out to could really force teams to focus more time, energy and attention on the perimeter. [This isn't a perfect example](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxMGPsKPmyyEggnpkwZOULcjJVvRbYojxa) of that but its at least them using motion off ball to actually take advantage of the gravity AD creates so regularly

&#x200B;

Pick n Rolls (aka PnRs):

&#x200B;

This is an obvious one because AD is obviously a great lob threat, but I still feel as if the team doesn't try and use PnRs to their advantage as much as they should (LeBron coming back could help this a lot tbf)

&#x200B;

[The play](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxzTgI-l4OoFBEDagEpAeh-JNMQCHfnIK9) doesn't even have to be trying to force AD the ball, you can use it to open up passes to other players, which can in turn get enough of the defenses attention to get him open looks if the defense respects the other players just a bit

&#x200B;

[A similar example to the last](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxsZ8jPfO8x0nJD6ShoIjXmTOCEHDzWJA-)

&#x200B;

[A play like this](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxwyy2PBiqj6oQON9eV7NKHOrDz0QZg2bb) requires the defense respecting the guard on the roll, but this is the sort of pay off we can also see as we punish teams more from doubling AD. This is very achievable with LeBron, was a staple of the 2020 run, and yet its just severely under utilized even when he's playing

&#x200B;

[Another example](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxzTgI-l4OoFBEDagEpAeh-JNMQCHfnIK9) of an imperfect jumper that's still much better than a ton of their offensive possessions

100,How Do We Know Ownership Won't Make The LakerS Front Office Choose Between Reaves And D'Lo This Offseason?,11wsvot,"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10030461-how-la-lakers-mismanaged-their-way-from-champs-to-chumps
> Had L.A. paid Nunn a slightly lower figure in his first year (just $35,258 less), it could have used the remainder to sign undrafted rookie Austin Reaves to a three-year contract starting at $925,258, instead of a two-year minimum deal for the promising rookie.
        
Here's an article *today*: https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-austin-reaves-is-making-a-leap-but-gilbert-arenas-rule-may-make-it-hard-for-la-to-pay-him-for-it/
    
So there you have it, Reaves wouldn't even be a RFA this offseason looking at a payday if LAL's front office had bothered to do their homework *after flunking it the first two times* with Caruso and THT. To be clear, the Lakers aren't the only team to screw this particular facet up (looking at you Chicago with Ayo), but it's so telling that it's such a repeating pattern. OKC got this right with Lu Dort. The Clippers did the same thing with Terrance Mann. The Pelicans' Front Office gets a lot of flack, but they nailed it *three times* between Naji Marshall, Herb Jones, and Jose Alvarado.  IF a player from outside the first-round is good enough to make the roster, he's good enough to get a 3+ year deal. What's the worst case scenario? He turns out to be as unplayable at the NBA level as plenty of other end-of-bench guys?
      
Correct if I'm wrong, but the last four players to play three years  *on the same contract* for the Lakers are: Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Brandon Ingram, and Julius Randle.  While Alex Caruso and Talen Horton-Tucker both played 3+ seasons, it came over the course of multiple 2-year ocntracts. Contrary to popular belief, it wasn't the Westbrook trade that cost the Lakers Caruso, it was not signing either him or THT to a 3-year rookie deal. Either contract would have put most of Caruso's cost for at least the 21-22 season under the luxury tax.   
    
Right now the Lakers are enjoying a strong 2nd half of the season, because Reaves on his current salary figure is helping to maximize the salary to production output ratio, but given the history of this front office (and the signing off by ownership) of not committing to anybody other than super stars to longer than two years, how likely is that both come back? Especially if there's any hitch with Dallas retaining Kyrie? Even if you  retaun D'Lo *at 60%*, the reported offers for Reaves with D'Lo would still put LAL too close to the luxury tax for auxulliary moves.
      
Feel free to correct any fault in my reasoning. Maybe that's why Pelinka wasn't very eager to part ways with 1sts until such a near slam dunk deal came through the pipeline.",AnotherStatsGuy,30,0,0.41

111,Who is the worst NBA player that could lead the 16th seed to a March Madness Championship?,11wq17r,"Who is the worst player in the NBA that could lead a 16th seed to a March Madness Championship?

I saw this question on Twitter and wanted Reddit’s opinion. This is also a gauge in the difference in ability from college to NBA.

I think we can cross off MVP level players, I firmly believe Giannis/Jokic could lead the “scrubs” to the ring. 

On the other hand is it outrageous to say role players couldn’t achieve this? Maybe it’s dependent on position, I don’t think back up point guards such as Caruso or Ish Smith could overcome the difference in talent between 16th seed and elite teams. 

So it begs the question what type of talent is the bare minimum needed to overcome the odds. 


Things to consider: 
- Shorter 3 Point Line
- Does it have to be a big man to help with defensive issues the team would have?
- Paolo Banchero couldn’t lead duke to the championship and he was the number 1 pick.
- They’re players in college right now better than some NBA players.",SpaceFluffy,108,0,0.41

""I think obviously the goal is for LeBron to return at some point before the season concludes, but what I'm hearing is that still might be a push right there, him returning at some point. I reported a few weeks ago... the Lakers had to try and do whatever they could to try to win as many games as possible to give LeBron James as much time to recover as possible. So that means that even when he does come back, he might not be fully healthy, but just trying to buy him some time. With that said, I don't know how realistic it is that he returns with some games left in the regular season. That is definitely the goal, LeBron James is shooting for that, I just don't know how realistic it is right now.. Can LeBron come back the final two games of the regular season? ... I think definitely that's a possibility but I think it's still premature as of right now. The way it was explained to me that might be a push right there""

Both players never really got it going or had shown glimpses of their potential, and effectively lost. Both also had 1 game where they were both below 20 points (KD G3, JT G6) and less than 5 FGM (JT G1 - 3/17, KD G2 - 4/17).

\#	|	Team	|	Δ	|	Record	|	Comment	|
--: 	|	:--	|	:--	|	:-:	|	:--	|
1	|	[](/MIL) Bucks	|	--	|	51-20	|	The Bucks are rolling. As winter fades away in Milwaukee, they have emerged as the clear-cut favorites to win the East -- and maybe the whole thing. They have a 2.5-game cushion over the second-place Celtics and Sixers with only 11 games left, and Vegas has finally given them their due respect as the title frontrunners. Giannis is the best player in the sport even if nobody wants to give him the MVP, Brook Lopez might be playing the best basketball of his All-Star career at 34, and Khris Middle is basically back to normal. Watching this team the last few months has been a treat as a fan, it certainly feels like the best Bucks team I'll see in my lifetime.	|
2	|	[](/PHI) 76ers	|	+2	|	48-22	|	The Sixers are rolling and Joel Embiid might finally lock up a legacy defining piece of hardware. It's hard to argue against the Sixers being one of the hottest teams in the league right now, especially as some of the teams in front of them are having some stumbles down the stretch. A big reason why The Sixers are succeeding? Tyrese Maxey. He's once again found his aggression and his shot from deep. They'll need him and Harden to play at this level to finally break the second round curse.	|
3	|	[](/BOS) Celtics	|	--	|	49-23	|	The Celtics are 7-6 since the All-Star break and have continuously floundered to find any sort of stable footing. The fanbase is fighting over whether to place the blame on Joe Mazzulla or Jayson Tatum, or a combination of the two. Tatum has been hot and cold all season, and recently has played awful. At the same time, Joe Mazzulla has had multiple questionable to outright malpractice coaching decisions, especially when it comes to in-game play calling down the stretch. To make matters worse, the 76ers finally caught up and overtook the Celtics for the 2 seed in the East. It's time to nut up or shut up for the Celtics, and the final 10 games of the season will determine how the fanbase and the team as a whole feels going into the postseason. They've got matchups @Kings, Pacers, Spurs, @Wizards, @Bucks, Jazz, @76ers, Raptors twice at home, and then the Hawks at home to close out the season. The fight for the 2 seed could very well come down to April 4th when the Celtics go into Philly, but before that you have to take care of business and win the games you're supposed to win, or else the Celtics won't even be in a position to fight for 2nd. 	|
4	|	[](/DEN) Nuggets	|	-2	|	48-24	|	Despite remaining on top of the West, the Nuggets have struggled as of late, only winning 2 of their last 7 games. Defense and rebounding have disappeared and allowing second chance points has been a common theme. Despite this, the team is still at full strength and they still have time to adjust and refocus in time for the playoffs.	|
5	|	[](/CLE) Cavaliers	|	+2	|	45-28	|	The Cavs went 5-2 since the previous power rankings and will need to have a 5-4 or better record over the last 9 games to get their first 50 win season without LeBron in 30 years. With 7 of those matchups being against Brooklyn(2x), Houston, Charlotte, Indiana, and Orlando(2x), it would be a massive disappointment for them to go under .500 in this final stretch. Evan Mobley has been special over the last two months, averaging 18.8 ppg on 58.6% ts%, 9.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.4 stocks a game, while cementing himself as a DPOY candidate as the anchor of the Cavs #1 rated defense. On the season, he’s leading the league in defensive win shares, he has the most 3s contested in the league, and is in the 99th percentile rim protection. Cavs fans would take to the streets for anything less than 1st team all-defense for the 21 year old Mobley.	|
6	|	[](/SAC) Kings	|	+2	|	43-27	|	The playoffs are well within the grasps of the Kings.. showing they can beat some of the best teams in the league Fox continues to show he’s the 4th quarter assassin. Sabonis has been on fire throughout this tough stretch putting up triple doubles and making sure this team gets open look with his passing and screens.. Keegan “Keegan Murray” Murray continues to showcase his three point game as he is 22 away from breaking the rookie 3pt record held by Donovan Mitchell. This team continues to their mission to not only stay within the top 6 but have their eyes set on the 1 and 2 seed in the west. 	|
7	|	[](/NYK) Knicks	|	-2	|	42-30	|	[GO NEW YORK GO NEW YORK GO](https://external-preview.redd.it/x8A52EJKcvFkTU7iUgE2Z2vhHQZgFTlnMbKdAUXDQPs.gif?width=356&height=200&format=mp4&v=enabled&s=16c05952ede16ab9207a1ec23b009e6fdcbf37ca)	|
8	|	[](/MEM) Grizzlies	|	+1	|	43-27	|	The team has responded nicely to the absence of Ja while he was on his healing retreat; and frankly there's a ton of praise to be passed around. Tyus Jones getting his first triple double, Dillon Brooks being generally a menace to society, David ""Big Body"" Roddy jumping up the rookie charts, but ultimately the love has to be centered around Jaren Jackson Jr. His last three games have him averaging 28/6/2 as well as keeping his blocks average close at 3. The version of JJJ we saw against Golden State is a guy that could be an MVP caliber player; an elite offensive rim protector and an elite post threat. His fouling has been much better all season, and the race for DPOY between him and Brook Lopez looks to be a photo finish. Ja comes back from his suspension on Monday, with a potential to make his first appearance on Wednesday against the Rockets; just in time to prime up for what looks to be a promising playoff run.	|
9	|	[](/PHX) Suns	|	-3	|	38-33	|	KD slipped during warm ups. Luckily he looks alright and I think he's just out as a precaution, but we gave up two important pieces to get him and it shows given the recent stretch of games while he's been out. 	|
10	|	[](/LAC) Clippers	|	+4	|	38-34	|	Westbrook is starting to settle into his role, and Ty Lue is searching for the best rotations. Already Westbrook has been an amazing facilitator, and even when his shots aren't falling the way he wants to, he is still able to rebound, find open shooters, or just organize the offense in ways we haven't seen since CP3. With only 0.5 games behind the suns, the Clippers could regain the 4th seed for some home field advantage, likely against the Suns.	|
11	|	[](/MIA) Heat	|	+2	|	39-34	|	Things have gone better as of late but they're going to hopefully get better. We went .500 against teams in similar places as us as well as blowing the Grizzlies out of the water. Now we're headed into a couple difficult games mixed in with some games that we have no business losing. The tentative hope would be for us to sneak out of the play-in, although we're probably not getting passed our first match up. If we do avoid having to play the play-in tournament, then best match up to see us in the 2nd round would be the Cavaliers. However, a Celtics - Heat match up would be very exciting to watch. Or maybe a throwback of Knicks vs Heat from forever ago. First thing's first is making sure we are actually involved in the postseason this year. 	|
12	|	[](/BKN) Nets	|	+4	|	39-32	|	The Nets are looking better defensively as the players get more familiar with one another. While the offense depends on good shooting from the three point line, defense is something that the Nets can control every night. High powered offense will give this Nets team trouble as they will have to scramble to match the offensive output some teams can put forth. It's a developmental season for this unit, they will look to hold onto the 6th seed and try to put upa  fight in the playoffs as they move forward to the draft with 2 picks to work with	|
13	|	[](/DAL) Mavericks	|	-2	|	36-35	|	The Mavs may have saved their season off of Maxi Kleber's heroic 3 against the Lakers and Dwight Powell's 22 & 8 on 100% shooting vs the Spurs. The common factor in those games is that Christian Wood played 28+ minutes in both games, which has become a rarity. If the Mavs can finally play their three best players (Luka, Kyrie, Wood) for 30+ minutes each, they should be able to close their weak end of schedule out with dominance.	|
14	|	[](/GSW) Warriors	|	-4	|	36-36	|	The road Warriors strike again. The last time the Warriors lost at home was Feb 11th (8 game win streak) The last time they won on the road was January 30th (11 game losing streak). Nothing like sleeping in your own bed. With his wrist injury Iguodala is essentially retired. The once cornerstone roll player quintessential to the 2015 championship run will be forever a Warrior and fan favorite.	|
15	|	[](/OKC) Thunder	|	+6	|	35-36	|	The Thunder are still somehow alive for a play in spot. This week we play the Clipper twice and Lakers once and will likely determine the feasibility of whether or not we can pull this off. Every game has been super intense because the stakes have been so high (for us). Each win feels more and more important, and all I can really say is: the vibes are immaculate.	|
16	|	[](/LAL) Lakers	|	+2	|	35-37	|	The team built great momentum and really looked poised to get into the top 6, until they dropped two inexcusable losses to the Rockets and Mavericks, specially the Mavericks loss was a gut punch for the team and fan base. The Western standings are so fluid that the Lakers were a Kleber buzzer-beater away from being the 6th seed and now instead are the 10th. They bounced back on Sunday vs. the Magic led by AR’s career-high 35 and the hope is to keep fighting through till the King’s anticipated return within the next couple of weeks. Meanwhile, AD has struggled with his offense as of late and the team needs the big man to tune himself back in for the final push.	|
17	|	[](/TOR) Raptors	|	-1	|	35-37	|	Toronto looks like a team slightly better than .500. For some fans, this gives them hope, while some other fans are worried the Raptors will be stuck in the no man's land for years to come. 	|
18	|	[](/ATL) Hawks	|	-1	|	35-36	|	There's a lot of ""Is Quin Snyder actually better than Nate McMillan"" discourse going on right now. Mostly because the Hawks with Quin have also been terrible, but most people seem to be missing the point of why we brought Quin in the for the final 20 games. It wasn't for him to come in and turn our season around and win us a championship. There was never going to be enough time for Quin to make tangible changes. These last 20 games are for Quin to evaluate the roster and figure out who he does and doesn't want around next year. This team was always going to end up the play-in, but that doesn't matter because this season (and last season) was a wash the day they signed Nate to an extension. I don't really know if the future is bright or bleak, but it's the only thing worth focusing on. 	|
19	|	[](/MIN) TWolves	|	-7	|	35-37	|	Tough season for the Wolves got tougher over the weekend. A season compromised by the injury of Karl-Anthony Towns got worse with Anthony Edwards going down to an ankle injury. Combined with so-so play and tough losses the Wolves season is looking like a disaster. 	|
20	|	[](/CHI) Bulls	|	+4	|	33-37	|	Pat Bev was able to score 14 points in 2 and a half minutes, so I'm feeling better about this team. They have been playing better at both ends, and are actually making 3s now, shooting 42% since the last rankings. Whoever told Demar to start shooting 3s and Vucevic to stop shooting 3s was a genius. The next 2 games against the Sixers will show how this team can handle playoff talent in the East. 	|
21	|	[](/UTA) Jazz	|	+1	|	34-36	|	The Jazz face a choice, so dire, To compete and let the players aspire, Or tank and aim for a high draft pick, For a new franchise star and experience to stick. To give up now, and look ahead, Or fight for wins, and never dread, To a future, with a top prospect in tow, To fight for each win and go with the flow. Lauri Markkanen, a star on the rise, could he lead the team, to a new prize, And Walker Kessler, has blocks to spare, should the Jazz keep pushing, or choose to take care? A dilemma, that weighs heavily on the mind, But the answer, they will eventually find, For every player, coach, and fan, Utah need to hold firm and take a stand.	|
22	|	[](/NOP) Pelicans	|	-3	|	34-37	|		|
23	|	[](/WAS) Wizards	|	-3	|	32-39	|	Lizards are part of a group of animals known as reptiles. They are most closely related to snakes. In fact, some lizards, called sheltopusiks, look like snakes because they have no legs! Many lizards today resemble the ancient reptiles of the dinosaur era. Their ancestors appeared on Earth over 200 million years ago. That was also the last time the Washington Wizards looked like a competitive, cohesive basketball team. Corey Kispert has been incredible these past couple of weeks as he prepares to become a married man. Bradley Beal continues to be enemy number one for fans as nothing he does can appease critics of his large contract. And unfortunately, it looks like the Wes Unseld Jr era could be coming to a close after this season and he continues to have worse rotation management than a flat tire. Its a sad season.	|
24	|	[](/IND) Pacers	|	+1	|	32-39	|	The Pacers continue to tread water as the season winds down. Rookie sixth man Bennedict Mathurin and Tyrese Haliburton's injuries have put a damper on the final weeks, but Indiana still finds themselves just outside the play-in games. 8 of Indiana's last 11 games are against current playoff teams, so they'll probably need some assistance from the other playoff hopefuls if they want to sneak into one of the last spots. 	|
25	|	[](/ORL) Magic	|	+1	|	29-43	|	Probably stuck in the same spot in the standings regardless of what happens rest of the season. So time to just look forward to the lottery and the draft.	|
26	|	[](/POR) Trail Blazers	|	-3	|	31-40	|		|
27	|	[](/CHA) Hornets	|	--	|	22-50	|		|
28	|	[](/SAS) Spurs	|	+1	|	19-52	|	Jeez we gotta stop timing these with drinking weekends, I live in Boston and St. Patty's is always a mess. The Spurs have been on a bit of a heater recently by our standards (as have Houston, for that matter), while Detroit seems to be leaving the rest of the tanks in the dust at this stage. Keldon and Devin have been playing great (Keldon's averaging 22/7/4 while Vassell is averaging 17/4/4), and are showing the potential of being great supporting pieces on a future playoff team. Zach Collins has been a stud since Jakob was traded as well, averaging 16.6/8.1/3.8 on 46/44/91 splits over that time, and more recently has average 23/8/4/1/1.5 on 53/57/100 since getting choked out by MPJ in a game. We have NOP, MIL, WAS, @BOS, UTA, @GSW, @SAC coming up over the next two weeks, home stretch time!	|
29	|	[](/HOU) Rockets	|	+1	|	18-53	|	Jabari Smith's surge mirrors what we saw from Jalen Green after the all star break last year, and it has brought newfound optimism to the Rockets fanbase, and KJ Martin seems to have stepped up in tandem. Make no mistake, the tank is still in effect, but we're seeing the first signs that the team could make the step up that is demanded next season.	|
30	|	[](/DET) Pistons	|	-1	|	16-56	|	James Wiseman is coming off of what was probably the best game of his career last night against Miami. I've still got mixed feelings about trying to develop both him and Duren, but they have looked nice together at times recently - particularly against Denver when they were throwing each other lobs. Otherwise Ivey's cooled off on his shooting recently but his ballhandling continues to, generally, be getting stronger as the season wears on. Eugene Omoruyi has been a surprisingly strong late season addition that much of our fanbase would rather retain over Marvin Bagley. That said, the tank rolls on as we look toward a draft that seems to have more question marks in it - not less - as we inch closer to it.	|",powerrankingsnba,46,105,0.93

He will be a restricted free agent this summer, and will undoubtedly have multiple suitors looking to pry him from the Lakers — especially after stat lines like Sunday’s.

Should Reaves keep leading the tank gang or look to join a contender this offseason? The Lakers will have to extend Dlo and Rui as well, not to mention Beasley’s team option, so it’s possible at least one of them will leave or get traded.

The Pelicans/Hornets thing might seem complicated at first, but it's pretty simple. The Pelicans get credit for all the games in New Orleans and the Hornets get credit for all the games in Charlotte (despite the fact that's not exactly how things played out). 

I mentioned Giannis as the reason for this post in the first place, and it's largely because I had no clue who the Bucks leader was in games played prior to him. It was Bucks legend  >!Junior Bridgeman!<.

Lastly, here's a list of every player in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons with a single franchise:

1\. Dirk

T-2. Kobe

T-2. Udonis Haslem

That's right despite playing 20 seasons for the Heat, Haslem is still not the franchise leader in games played. I know he's essentially been an assistant coach for the past 5+ seasons, but it shows just how unique he is that he can bring value to 1 franchise for 2 decades despite his limited ability to actually play.",RecordReviewer,41,88,0.93

Steph: 29.8/6.2/6.2 on 50/43/91 splits (66.6 TS%), 46/72 games played

Dame: 32.2/4.7/7.2 on 46/37/91 splits (64.5 TS%), 57/71 games played

SGA: 31.4/4.8/5.5 on 51/35/90 splits (62.6 TS%), 60/71 games played

Mitchell: 27.4/4.1/4.6 on 47/37/87 splits (60.7 TS%), 61/73 games played

I personally think Steph has missed too many games to make it - historically 56 games (if he plays every remaining game) gets you at best 3rd team so it's probably between Dame and SGA assuming both play the rest of the season.",d33jay64,176,39,0.89

It’s only been a few games, but the early returns are encouraging: the Heat are 3-1 when he has played in this stretch.

Lowry has been a boost to the Miami Heat bench unit since returning and has proven himself to be a steadying presence that sharply contrasts the sporadic play of Victor Oladipo, who he has replaced in the rotation.

He will still be the owner of one of the worst contracts in Heat franchise history, but it’s nice to see that Spoelstra is finding ways to maximize him in a limited role (and that he apparently is accepting of this new role).",lopea182,25,66,0.86
138,Why do people think Steph and KD have declined?,11whyw3,"For the past year I've been seeing people saying that these 2 have declined. Sometimes it's outright explicitly saying it and sometimes it's putting players like Giannis or Jokic over 2 guys whose peaks are top 15 all time at the very least. I just want to know why people think these 2 have declined. 

In 2021, these guys were top 3 locks according to everybody. Both had arguments for best in the world with Lebron's decline that year. Steph had his best or second best regular season that year while KD showed that while he had changed, he was still at least as good as he was in OKC/GS. KD was pretty much the consensus best player after the Bucks series that year(which I thought was undeserved because Steph and Harden both outperformed KD in the RS and didn't really get to show out in the playoffs to sway the public). Last year KD looked just as good while Steph started the season on an absolute tear. They were the leading MVP candidates and people said that they were better than ever. KD ended up missing too many games while Steph went on a months long slump after Thanksgiving that was clearly unrelated to his body declining. Steph ended up breaking out of his slump became a monster in the playoffs as usual and won a ring+FMVP. KD had a bad first round series, but that was clearly due to factors outside of his control like Ben Simmons' salary not playing and Kyrie not showing up while KD was getting swarmed by the Cs. KD has proved this season that he's still the same player though and both of these guys are putting up some of the best stats of their career, even when adjusted for pace and efficiency. Watching them, I legit don't see any difference between 2023 and 2021. 

While I can see how KD's less varied and more specialized shot selection can turn off some people, I don't get how that doesn't make him even better seeing as how his midrange jumper is wetter than ever. His defense is back to GS level despite having less help too. Additionally, even if we ignore all context in last year's playoffs, 4 games doesn't compare to the 35-50ish RS games he's played each year since 2020-21, many of which featured KD coasting due to age and recent injuries. 

On the other hand, there's absolutely no argument for Steph being any worse than he was at his peak. Statswise, he's been pretty consistent with his past seasons. Going off the eye test, he's better than he was in the early dynasty years due to his added strength and improved defense and virtually identical to 2021. Like KD, he's had random contact injuries this year, but Steph has never been the epitome of good health and his injuries haven't slowed him down one bit. 

How are these guys not the consensus #1 and #2 in the league? Do people not watch their games anymore? These guys have adapted their games like Lebron did in his second Cavs stint to become better than ever. Saying that anybody else is close to these 2 is straight up disrespectful.",NotUrAvgShitposter,36,0,0.32

Pg - Magic Johnson - magics passing would be a show to watch on its own. His length would makes up for steph being undersized. But steph is also excellent at playing off ball and would get a crazy amount of clean looks of magic.
Sg - Steph Curry - Curry is a player who excellent at playing off the ball and moving through picks that’s his game.
Sg - Micheal Jordan - MJ is there for ISO’s and taking over the game if needed
Pf - Kareem Abdul Jabbar - Adds another unguardable dimension with the sky hook. Kareem wins chips in highschool, college, and 6 nba rings? 
C - Shaquille O’Neil - Shaq would easily be one of the best screen setters which would open crazy looks for steph and better spacing for magic to move around.

Dennis Rodman - every successful team needs hustle player. Hustle to players who do that do well on other stats besides scoring with first class defence at any position while having the ability to get into players heads to the point their playing bad is underrated with results!

143,Anthony Davis since the trade deadline,11wgnef,"Without D’Angelo Russell in the lineup:

33 PPG / 14 RPG on 21 FGA per game

With D’Angelo Russell in the lineup: 

9 games (6-3 record) 

19 PPG, 13 RPG on 15 FGA per game 

During the 2022-2023 season Anthony Davis is averaging 25.8 PPG on 17.2 FGA and 12.5 RPG in 46 games played. 

But it seems that he becomes very passive with D’Angelo Russell in the lineup. 

His PPG drops from 25.8 to 19. 

His FGA drop from 17.2 to 15. 

Is this because D’Angelo is not a true point guard, but more of a scoring guard? 

He doesn’t seem to have a good passing ability, but he shoots and scores well. 

I think he is a perfect fit next to LeBron and AD for spacing and scoring purposes, but he is detrimental to AD’s offensive game when he is the main ball handler.

If you take his stats without LeBron and D’Lo we can see why some consider him the top 10 player: 

His PPG increases up to 33 PPG and he takes 4-6 more shots per game. 

This is the Anthony Davis the Lakers need to make the playoffs. A 33 PPG monster who takes 20+ shots per game and grabs 15 rebounds.

### Streak Similarities: 
 
+ Both the Rockets and Heat won 26 of 27 games, thanks to their streaks.

+ Both the Rockets and Heat were victims of each other's streaks. [Meaning the Rockets beat the Heat during their streak, and the Heat beat the Rockets during theirs.]

+ Both the Rockets and Heat had winning streaks of exactly 4 games immediately preceding the start of their 20+ game streaks. The last 2 wins of those 4-game streaks took place on the *same dates*, 1/23 & 1/25. Both 4-game streaks ended on 1/27. By the way, the days of the week for these dates are exactly the same (i.e. 1/23 is a Monday for both years, etc.). ^**Because ^2008 ^was ^a ^leap ^year, ^and ^2013 ^was ^not, ^the ^days ^of ^the ^week ^are ^no ^longer ^synced ^after ^2/28.

+ Both the Rockets and Heat beat the Atlanta Hawks on 3/12, 6 days prior to their showdown with the Celtics, AND it was their 2nd time beating the Hawks during their respective streaks. Atlanta scored 18 points in the 1st quarter in both of the 3/12 games.

### Game Similarities: 

+ The Celtics were on a 2 game winning streak coming in to both games.

+ Guess which referee reffed both games (1 guess):          >!Infamous NBA referee Scott Foster officiated both games (because of course he did, but you already knew that didn't you?).!<

+ The winner in each of the 3/18 games went on to win the NBA Championship later that season.

+ Boston made exactly 15 FTs and had 3 players in double figures in both games.

+ The ""No Stats All-Star,"" Shane Battier played in both games for the team that had won 22 straight. He finished with a +/- of **-15** in both games. 😂

+ Paul Pierce played for Boston in both games. 

***
### Notable Missed Similarities: ###
+ Both Ray Allen & Kevin Garnett *could* have played in both games, but each were inactive for 1 of the 2 games, but NOT the same one. 
+ Rajon Rondo *could* have played in both games, but was inactive for 1 of them.


***
### Other tidbits:
+ Coming into the Boston game, the Rockets had a differential of +272 during the streak. The Heat had a differential of +257.

+ Mike Bibby was beaten twice (2/13 & 3/12) by the Rockets playing for TWO different teams during their streak because he was traded from the Kings to the Hawks on 2/16/08. 

+ Larry Hughes took 3 L's (2/7, 2/19, 2/24) from the Rockets because he was traded from the Cavs to the Bulls on 2/21/08.
  Drew Gooden and Shannon Brown were also traded with Hughes, but were inactive in 1 or 2 of the 3 games.

+ Patrick Patterson was beaten twice (2/6 & 2/26) by the Heat because he was traded from the Rockets to the Kings on 2/20/13. Cole Aldrich  and Toney Douglas were also traded with Patterson, but were inactive in 1 of the games.

##The Boston Celtics played the Golden State Warriors on 12/11/15, who had won 23 straight, so they were ***1 game*** too late from being the opponent in 3 of the 4 instances in which a team was going for their 23rd straight win. Boston, AGAIN, was on a 2 game winning streak coming into that game.


It took me about 2 hours of research on BBall Reference for this post. ""I just drank a fifth of vodka. Dare me to peruse BBall Reference?""

I didn't have time to use any advanced analytics, and I don't have access to Chat GPT, so perhaps someone out there can do a deep dive and see if there are any Fractals, Fibonacci sequences, or Lucas Numbers involved or other crazy similarities that prove we are indeed living in a simulation. The odds on some of these things are off the charts! Cue the Seinfeld ""big coincidences"" debate.",LeagueFucked,15,268,0.93

The free throw line is 15 feet away from the basket. The furthest field goal attempt by Jimmy and Bam were 13 feet, for both of them. They were great, feasting on putbacks, layups and close mid range.

The clippers and PHX are in a different adjustment entanglement however and I think their issues are more about getting their 2 new superstar players each familiarized w the team and FAST. and historically that hasnt been the case. but we’ll out if Kawhi-PG-Russ is better than CP3-booker-durrant experiments.",everykissbeginswK,12,0,0.45

Seems like the Blazers are probably looking to shut him down as they have with Grant but he just wants to carry on playing, honestly it’s pretty admirable that an ageing superstar is still so determined to play despite being fully aware there’s nothing to play for the rest of the season.

It wasn't until this 4 game slump that everyone is considering the idea that maybe Jokic isn't as good as we thought he was. Maybe he isn't invincible! He can be stopped!

But if he shuts everyone up and ends the season absolutely dominating with a 70%+ win record, the 25/12/10 he had going, do you think it might actually benefit him? Because there was no narrative for Jokic to shoot-down before, it was simply, ""He's really good and its getting boring, but Giannis is going on a 15+ game win steak, and Embiid is healthy and his numbers are becoming historic."" Giannis and Joel were becoming the talk of the town.

174,"The Other, Other Guy: The Third ""Star"" of NBA Championship Teams",11w48r4,"PRELUDE: My method of determining the third best player on teams is absolutely terrible, but I'm sticking through- I took the third best player of each championship team by win shares and ranked them all- first of all, I don't necessarily agree with every take from win shares, and some of them CERTAINLY don't match up with popular consensus. Anyway, on to the overly pretentious opening. 

Of course, a championship team is anchored by its super star- you think of the Jordan Bulls, Magic Lakers, Lebron whatever team he's on. Sometimes, there's even a duo involved, be it Duncan and Robinson, James and Davis, or Jordan and Pippen! Then you have the third guy. The mythical big three calls to mind images of super teams, but how does EVERY championship team's third guy shape out? Do you need a star to fill the role? To explore this question, I ranked all 73 ""third"" players by win shares! To go with the regular season stat (winshares), also throwing in a few rudimentary stats from their playoff run that year! Who contributes more to winning? Another premier scorer or that rock solid glue guy?

194,The Denver Nuggets might need to trade Jamal Murray,11vz652,"BEFORE YOU RESPOND, please just read the post first because the title is not what you might assume!!!


Nikola Jokic is making the Nuggets look a lot better than they really are, and if they want to have any shot at winning the championship, they need to get some more pieces around Jokic. 


However, looking at their salary situation, that is going to be a problem. Denver is currently $35 million over the salary cap, and they may very well have the worst contract in the NBA right now with Michael Porter Jr. Right now he’s in the first year of a 5 yr/$180mil deal that he’s on until the end of the 2027 season. I say this because while he’s an elite shooter, he provides little to no value in just about every other aspect of the game. He’s an adequate rebounder, maybe, but he’s a cone on defense and provides zero playmaking ability. He’s essentially a black hole on offense and a non factor on defense, and he’ll be making $180 million through 2027. I didn't even mention him being injury prone too. Not great.


Now if we take a look at their other pieces, the players that fit well with Jokic that Denver should absolutely not look to trade (if they can avoid it) are Aaron Gordon, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Bruce Brown. They all provide defensive value, can stretch the floor, and don’t need the ball in their hands to be effective. Outside of those 3 guys, the only tradeable pieces of some value that Denver has are Jeff Green, Ish Smith, Thomas Bryant, Zeke Nnaji… not really enough to get Jokic any legitimate help.


Now Denver obviously could package either 2 or 3 of the aforementioned players (Gordon, Brown, KCP) in order to find another star to pair with Jokic, but that would gut their defense and depth even further than it already is. And since the MPJ contract is one that I don’t think any other GM would be willing to touch, and Denver can’t do anything in free agency in terms of really bringing Jokic more help, Jamal Murray seems to be the odd man out here.


Murray had a great run in the 2020 bubble, but outside of then he’s mostly just been looking like an above average starting combo guard. He can create well enough for himself off the dribble, shoot pretty well, and provides some playmaking value, which could make him an enticing option for some teams, although the $160mil contract he’s currently on isn’t exactly team friendly either. I haven’t gone through a rundown of every team to find the one(s) that would bring back the most value, or that would even accept a trade for Murray, but given Denver’s options if they want to compete for and win a championship, it seems like pretty much the only way that they can go. Do you guys agree?


TLDR: Denver is in contract hell with the shitty MPJ contract and they’re way over the cap so they can’t do anything to get Jokic more help in FA, so presumably the only way they can get Jokic more help to compete for a title w/o gutting their defense and depth is trading Jamal Murray.",C-DogDriver,72,0,0.32

201,Which alternate universe version of your team are you most sad about not being in this universe?,11vxe3n,"Im talking about stuff that was either obvious at the time, injuries, or 50/50 things just going the other way.  Not stuff like taking Giannis first overall when that was never a possibility at the time.

Like an example for the Sixers is they drafted Mikal Bridges in the lottery and traded him on the same day and/or Fultz not having a bizarre injury as the number 1 overall pick and/or letting Jimmy walk for Tobias Harris and Al Horford (ugh).  Obviously the butterfly effect would drastically change how the team operated if any of these came to pass but the Sixers werent that far away from:

PG: Harden

SG: Fultz

SF: Butler/Bridges

PF: Bridges/Butler

C: Embiid

202,What kind of contract could a player like Kenny Smith in his prime get in todays league?,11vx3p8,"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smithke01.html

Talking about Kenny Smith from Inside the NBA. While he was never a superstar level player, he put up decent numbers and would probably be a starting guard  on a lot of teams in his prime. Would constantly get above 40 percent from 3 point shooting too.  

He averaged 17.7 ppg, 7.1 ast and 2.1 rebounds in his best statistical year which was his 6th season.

He was also able to average a similar stat line his sophomore season. 

I feel like he would have had a massive contract if it was negotiated after his 4th or 6th season, just going off the consistency and potential.

Beyond the stat line he was able to co exist with a superstar player like Hakeem and was able to bring out the best in each other. Valuable trait to have for teams that built around a star.",Aktor56,20,19,0.8

However, I believe, Luka Doncic had a contract with Real Madrid at the time of the NBA draft.

But, if Wembanyama is still under contract, would his drafting team have to pay a transfer fee to Metropolitans 92? This phenomenon is not unheard of in other European sports. For example, when Cristiano Ronaldo went from Manchester United to Real Madrid, Real Madrid paid his former club 80M euros. I don't think Wembanyama would command more than a few million, but I'm sure any NBA team would pay it if given the opportunity to draft him in the NBA player.",JJWhatWhat,21,28,0.79

219,(O.C.) All the players who've been the best player on a championship going back 1969,11vrl05,"I think this is one of the true lists in this sport. It happens quite often where the guy who won MVP seems like the best player in the league, but then it's the guy who brought home the ring who really gets that praise. Giannis for instance, after the playoff exit in 2020 was getting widely slammed despite being a back to back mvp but, upon winning the ring in 2021, he became the top dog. Only 5 active players have done that. and the list of active nba players who've been the best player on a finals team but not win the ring isn't too long either. (Tatum, Booker, Jimmy Butler, and if you want you can include Dwight Howard since he's technically still playing basketball).

So let's list them I'll put the first year they did it, which should help for multiple time winners. I'll be starting from the latest.

**Any miscalculations here**

Let me explain any ""controversial"" picks I made in the making of the list here.  I am putting David Robinson as the best player on the 1999 Spurs as Duncan was still young, but I genuinely am unsure and will trust a random spurs fan on here if they say otherwise. I also have heard that Joe Dumars was up there with Isiah Thomas for those late 80s Pistons teams. and I think you can make the point for either Ben Wallace or Chauncey Billups for the 04 Pistons.

Also, I should note that I put Magic's first year as the best player on the champion lakers as 82. I wasn't sure if there was a solid argument for Kareem that year. I know for a fact Kareem was better in 1980. I am also putting Moses Malone, not Dr J as the best player on philly in 1983.

I'm not an expert on 70s basketball. I had trouble finding much about the 1979 Sonics, but Dennis Johnson seemed to have the superior accolades. I may have overrated Dave Cowens and maybe should have put havlicek in 1974 but cowens was the mvp in 1973 and John was older at that time so I made some assumptions.  Also, because I'm stopping at 1969, players who lead their teams to victory before that year(namely, Wilt and Bill Russell) will be getting credit at the first point in the timeline.

&#x200B;

Hope that all makes sense.

**The Actual List**

&#x200B;

2021: Giannis

2019 Kawhi Leonard

2017: KD

2015: Steph Curry

2012: Lebron James

2011: Dirk

2009 Kobe

2008: Kevin Garnet

2006: D-Wade

2004: Ben Wallace or Chauncey Billups

2000: Shaq

1999: Tim Duncan

1994: Hakeem

1991: Michael Jordan

1989 Isiah Thomas

1983: Moses Malone

1982: Magic Johnson

1981: Larry Bird

1979: Dennis Johnson

1978: Wes Unseld(or Elvin Hayes OR Bob Dandridge) 

1977: Bill Walton

1975: Rick Barry

1974: Dave Cowens(or Havlicek)

1972: Wilt Chamberlain(or Jerry West?) 

1971: Kareem Abdul-Jabar

1970: Willis Reed

1969: Bill Russell.

Edits: took out David Robinson for 1999 and  Joe Dumars for 1989. added in some other options for several teams in the 70s.  thanks u/[**bonziwellsayo**](https://www.reddit.com/user/bonziwellsayo/)**,** for that suggestion.   
 

&#x200B;

In total, that's about 27 unique players over a 54 year span, with the 70s having the most names with 8  unique mvps. where as the 2000s(the second highest) had 6 unique MVPS and the 80s and 90s had only 4 unique MVPS.

&#x200B;

If you cut it off at 1980, you get a pretty even average of a new best player on a finals team emerging 5 times per decade. and it's been 2 years since Giannis did it for the first time. Maybe this is a sign a new player will do it this year?

&#x200B;

of the 27 players only 6 never won an MVP award. The ones who didn't are Kawhi Leonard, whoever you pick from the 04 Pistons, Isiah Thomas, Dennis Johnson, and Rick Barry.

&#x200B;

Players who HAVE won MVP but are not, as of right now, on that list: Nikola Jokic(2020-21-2021-22), James Harden(2017-18), Russell Westbrook(2016-17) , Steve Nash (2004-05, 2005-06), Allen Iverson(2000-01)  Karl Malone(1996-97, 1998-1999) David Robinson (1994-95), Charles Barkley(1992-1993) Julius Erving(1980-81) and Bob mcadoo(1974-75). Note though that Dr. J and David Robinson did win a ring as a top 2 option on the team, unlike others on this list so i don't think they should count in the same way. 

&#x200B;

In compiling this I used [this list of previous finals MVPS](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/finals_mvp.html) and cross referenced it with a list of mvps from the same source (bball ref), and would clarify with wikipedia and LandofBasketball to be sure i was picking the right guy.

We tend to cite “pace and space” as the reason for the league’s scoring spike, but that wouldn’t explain the recent jump in FT%. The league FT% has been fairly steady for decades but it’s spiked recently.

There could be several factors for this —

— teams are playing fewer “bigs,” who traditionally aren’t good free throw shooters. They’re also running the offense through the post less often, which may mean fewer FT attempts for the big dudes who are still there.

— the league-wide emphasis on shooting may mean the perimeter players (guards and forwards) are better shooters than the past. We don’t see many defensive specialists anymore, or even traditional point guards who aren’t shooters (like a Rajon Rondo type.)",ZandrickEllison,34,174,0.96

Let’s say your team (mid/large market) has a summer where a max slot (however it may cost in any given year) frees up, but no big stars are available, but, the next year - multiple top 5 players are - however, there are quite a few decent starters (like we’re talking B- to C tier dudes who are great contributes, think of guys worth 10/20 mil, for example. These guys can’t lead a team, but they’re very solid contributors. However, if you sign them to multi year deals - you lose out on your max slot. 


Now, what i want to ask if the following would be legal:

Let’s say you offer two of these players, who are normally worth 10-20mil each a huge one year contract. Ex. Two one year 30mil to them, and mention that they intend to sign a big star the next year, however, if you wish to win the championship, you must sign the minimum the next season. You don’t have to sign, you can even turn this down if another team pays you more, but just know that this is the only condition i would have to give you this large overpay for one year. 


Is such a thing legal? or would it count as tampering? you’re not giving them money under the table per say, you also aren’t making them commit to the min the next year and are basically giving the player to go to another team in the next summer if they so wish.

Road: 7-29

What do I even say anymore? They have the 3rd worst road record and the 3rd best home record.

Early in the season it could be written off as them simply having bad luck, or missing shots, etc. At this point is it fair to say these are essentially two different teams? If this is the case, without home court advantage in any series, what are the odds we see them bounced in the first round in 5-6? 

Furthermore, with the West play in race being so tight, it’s plausible they end up the 8 seed or worse the 9 seed and potentially have to play one of the games on the road. Many have already pencilled in the Warriors as a playoff team, but with a rough schedule and plenty of road games left, there’s absolutely no guarantee they stay afloat.

284,Jakob Poeltl: The Most Underrated Center in the League,11v7yb6," 

I'm here to make a case for why Jakob Poeltl is the most valuable center in the league and how he can help the Raptors return to championship contention.

First off, let's take a look at his stats. Poeltl is averaging 9.4 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks per game this season. While those numbers may not jump off the page, he's doing it all while shooting a remarkable 65.7% from the field. That's second-best in the league among centers with at least 5 field goal attempts per game, behind only Rudy Gobert.

But it's not just his efficiency that makes him valuable. Poeltl is an elite rim protector, ranking fourth in the league in blocks per game. He alters shots and forces opponents to alter their game plan when attacking the basket.

But where Poeltl really shines is in his ability to set screens and roll to the rim. He's an excellent pick-and-roll player, and his ability to finish at the rim makes him a perfect fit for the modern NBA. He's currently averaging 1.34 points per roll, which is fourth-best in the league among centers with at least 3 rolls per game.

Now, I know what some of you are thinking. ""But what about Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokic? They're the best centers in the league!"" And while they're certainly great players, I would argue that Poeltl is more valuable to his team than either of them.

The Raptors have struggled this season, but Poeltl has been a bright spot. When he's on the court, the team has a net rating of +2.1. When he's off the court, that drops to -4.9. That's a massive swing, and it shows just how important he is to the team's success.

But the real reason why Poeltl is so valuable is because of his contract. He's currently making just $8.3 million per year, which is a bargain for a player of his caliber. With his current contract, the Raptors have the flexibility to add more talent around him and Pascal Siakam this offseason.

Jakob Poeltl is the most underrated center in the league. He's an elite rim protector, an excellent pick-and-roll player, and he's doing it all while shooting an absurdly high percentage from the field. He's also incredibly valuable to the Raptors, and his team-friendly contract gives them the flexibility they need to build a championship contender. Don't sleep on Poeltl, he's a future All-Star in the making.",SpicaComeBack,38,0,0.4
285,"The Sixers just played their 9th game in March ... Joel Embiid scored 325 POINTS in 303 MINUTES, through those 9 games! That's a franchise record 9 STRAIGHT games of 30+ Points for him and 8 STRAIGHT WINS ... He SAT OUT the entire 4th Quarter in 4 of them",11v7pjl,"[Source -- Brock Landes](https://twitter.com/LandesBrock/status/1637262289664393219) That's an amazing stat, Joel has sat out the 4th quarter ion four of the Sixers last nine games.

290,Is this the best window a Sixers side has had in the Embiid era?,11v79l8,"People will always lament what could have been after the 2019 series where the Sixers lost in Game 7 on a buzzer beater to the eventual champion Raptors.

There was even more lament about what could have been if they kept Jimmy instead of Tobias Harris.

But their current team looks primed to be one of the leading contenders of the East and frankly the title.

The West is looking kind of weak at the moment and a betting man would favor a champion from the East. Of the three main contenders (Sixers, Bucks and Celtics), Embiid may be having the strongest season of any player. They have figured out the Harden/Embiid PnR and have a reliable 3rd option in Maxey and have looked like the strongest team in the league since the All-Star break.

301,Why have the Bucks been so much better than last season regular season wise?,11v578q,"This Season with 12 games to go, the Bucks have already won 50 games and will likely be the 1 seed.

Last season the Bucks won just 51 games and got only the 3 seed.

Why have they been so much better this year in the regular season than last season? If I had to take a guess I would say because Brook Lopez has stayed healthy throughout this season unlike last season where he was out for most of the season.

302,[Discussion] Isn't it a bit strange to have zero teams with great point differentials?,11v4nun,"2019-20: Bucks had season avg of +10.1, and the Raptors, Celtics, Clippers were all over +6.0.

2020-21: Jazz had a +9.2 and the Clippers had a +6.2, with several others trailing close behind.

2021-22: Suns had a +7.5, Celtics had +7.3, and Warriors had +6.5.

This year: Zero teams above +6.0, and only two teams above +5.0 -- the Cavs at +5.6 and the Celtics at +5.4.

What do we think is the reason for this? League-wide parity? A lack of great teams or bottom teams? Interested to hear what people think.

311,Are the Denver Nuggets contenders or pretenders?,11v1knw,My gut says they're the latter even though I'm a big fan of Jokic. I just think they lack a real second star. Jamal Murray is a quality point guard but he's not like a Lillard or Steph for example. If they had like a Paul George or a Demar Derozan in addition to Jokic and Murray then I think they'd be a real threat. What do you all think?,RaiseLive1654,188,42,0.64

315,Worst award winning seasons from players in the last 25 years,11v16rw,"Who is the worst player to win each award in the span of 1998-2022? And I don't mean worst player in terms of career but worst seasons to win every major award. If you think 25 years is going too far back I'll try to include modern examples. Awards/honors to be omitted from this are all-defensive team, all-rookie team, stat leader titles like steals leader, all the character/community work awards, and All-Star Game MVP (b/c nobody gives a shit in the ASG)

Final disclaimer, **I'm not saying any of these players are bad because that's dumb to say that, I'm just comparing it to all other winners of the same award**

_______________________________

**MVP** - Karl Malone 98-99

This was the worst season in the given time frame pretty easily, MJ retired, lockout shortened, pace was slow as hell, no star player really stood out or had that great of a year. They had to give it to someone so they chose Malone. What's funny about this one is that Karl Malone's numbers were down than years prior, like this was his 10th highest season in PPG pretty sure. Other candidates would be Iverson in 01, Rose in 11, Nash in 05, Curry in 15 was kinda weak. Again great seasons but keep in mind it's compared to other MVPs

**FMVP** - Andre Iguodala 14-15

Not saying the man didn't deserve the award but come on, he was given it for being the most effective at stopping Lebron even though he still put up 36/13/9. Let's be honest, either Lebron or Steph should have won

**DPOY** - Marcus Camby 06-07

Should have been Duncan's, Camby is also the only retired DPOY never to be an all-star in his career. Other answers for this, and both of these will get shit, Kawhi's second DPOY in 2016 which should have been Draymond's, and Marcus Smart in 2022 which was questionable to say the least. I mean come on Gobert and Giannis were better defenders and he wasn't even the best defender on the team last finals (timelord)

**Sixth Man** - Jamal Crawford 2015-16

This one stuck out to me because 35 year old Crawford was absolutely not a better 6th man than someone like Iguodala. Not that it really matters but it was purely a reputation award or a name they associate with the trophy. Pretty sure he won it over Ginobili in another year too

**ROY** - Mike Miller 00/01

Respect to Mike Miller and everything but that draft was straight booty cheeks and Miller would average 12/4/2 on 29 minutes. But then again there is Malcolm Brogdon with 10/3/4 on 26 minutes in 2016-17, honestly take your pick

**Hustle Award** - Amir Johnson 17-18

Dumbass award lol but why Amir Johnson? I don't think even 6ers fans know

**Most Improved Player** - Alan Henderson 97-98

I'll be honest, I don't know who this guy is. He put up 14/6/1 and played for the Hawks. You can maybe say Monte Ellis in 06-07 putting up 17/3/4 on the Baron Davis Warriors. idk

**All-NBA First Team** - DeAndre Jordan 15-16

Another tough one because of course there wont be any bad players here but it's gotta be him or Marc Gasol in 14-15. DeAndre Jordan was a great player, one of the best defenders in the league (behind Draymond and Kawhi at that time but still), elite rebounder, elite rim protector, great at setting screens, highest FG% and efficiency at that time. But let's face it, it was a weak era for centers. People will say Joakim Noah but I remember each of these years and I'd put him ahead of DAJ or Gasol

**All-NBA Second Team** - Vin Baker 97-98

Baker was playing for the Sonics and was putting up 19/8/2, of course it was a great season but he was 11th in scoring and was competing with Shaq, Robinson, Webber, Mutombo, etc... at the same position. Maybe I'm being biased towards big names though in this case. Modern example? Uhhhhh... Julius Randle 2 years ago? Maybe Siakam in 2020. Again it's hard to say and I'm not trying to hate on these guys or anything, someone who knows more should comment if I'm off base

**All NBA-Third Team** - Eddie Jones 99-00

Put up 20/4/5 on the Hornets. Marbury the same year put up 22/3/8 on a bad Nets team, pretty empty stats. As you can gather it wasn't the strongest era for NBA talent. But modern examples again? Maybe Bogut in 2010, David Lee in 2013, Shaq in 2009

I don't really feel like doing all-defensive teams very much since I don't know how to judge defensive ability or whatever criteria. Knowing about different basketball players than your team was different up until 10 or so years ago because cable TV is all you had. Same for all-rookie teams, there isn't a way to compare players without it taking all day basically so I'll skip them. But here are some bonus awards for non-players:

**Coach of the Year**- Sam Mitchell 06-07

He was the coach of the Raptors who went 47-35 to make 3rd in conference that year, it was his only winning season on not that good of a team. Speaking of Raps coaches, Dwane Casey 17-18 is probably #2 for worst

**Executive of the Year** - Elgin Baylor 05-06

This one is tough because it was probably seen as a great year (47-35, 6th in conference) but Baylor is not fondly remembered as Clippers GM. They would go back to being >.500 the year after and he had only 2 winning seasons in 10 years, but the worst owner in NBA history was running the organization so how much can you blame Elgin. Other candidates are Masai Ujiri in for the 2013 Nuggets, great season but Morey should have won

**Western Conference Champion**: 2006 Mavericks

The West wins the title most of the time, it's crazy looking at finalists considering 16/25 have won and those who didn't were mostly repeat finalists. But I go with 06 Mavs for this one because of a comparably mediocre roster around Dirk and Dirk was still in his choker days. I'll talk more about this finals later but they were the worst interior D the Heat had faced and they didn't double Wade. But other acceptable answers for this are the 04 Lakers for being washed/chemistry issues, or 2021 Suns for last 10 years

**Eastern Conference Champion**: 2002 Nets

Honestly chose your pick between that or the 03 Nets, the East was just complete garbage and either team probably loses in the first round if they were in the West. In 03 they made it to the finals with a piping hot 49-33 record and they were coached by Byron Scott. Other answers for this would be 01 Sixers, 07 Cavs, 20 Heat

**NBA Champion** - 2006 Miami Heat

Ignoring all the controversy with the refs/calls in the final, this isn't that great of a roster. Sure you had Wade at his best and Shaq in his last prime year (put up 14/10/3 in the finals series however) but Haslem, Jason Williams, and Antoine Walker were the starters and washed up Zo, GP, Derek Anderson were depth. SVG was also fired 20 games in. It really is a shame how people will overlook Wade turning into MJ by going 35/8/4 because ""it was rigged"" despite it being a top 5 finals performance ever",lowercase-punishment,26,14,0.7
316,Which title in this century has the biggest asterisk?,11v10jo,"For any reason: questionable refereeing (fixed games), injuries, complete luck

Notable years:

2002- Lakers win a wcf against SAC that looked blatantly fixed

2006- DWade shoots more freethrows than the entire Mavs team

2012- Miami Heat get some very favorable refereeing against a baby Thunder team

2015- Okc, Memphis, and Rockets plagued by injuries so the west is wide open. Warriors face an injured Cavs team in the finals without Kyrie and Love

2016- Green is suspended in the finals

2017/18- Durant Warriors superteam rings

2019- Raptors beat Sixers with a lucky bounce game winner. Beat Warriors with no Kd and Klay get’s injured

2020- The infamous bubble (mickey mouse) playoffs 

2021- Bucks get a very luck break against the Nets when iron man Harden suddenly has an injured hamstring. Kyrie goes down after Nets are up big. Kd still nearly pulls off the upset but an inch saves the Bucks season and their coach’s career. 

2022- Warriors beat Den without MPJ and Murray. Beat Grizzlies without Ja then face a weak Mavs team that upset the Suns.",SlimReaper35_,110,0,0.16

""Perusing around @bball_ref and found that the #Suns have shot more FT's than their opponent 23 times in 70 games (33% of games).

That is fourth lowest in the league by percentage:""


[](https://imgur.com/63ATWCB.jpg)

Some interesting tidbits are the Lakers out shooting opponents at the free throw line 72% of the time! 

Also,  the Bucks which are towards the bottom of the league in free throw attempts per game end up outshooting their opponents in 51% of the games. I'd be really curious on the opponents that the bucks are regularly outshooting. Pretty sure most of them are playoff opponents.

I'm starting to think that free throw attempts per game is not really a good gauge on whether a team is receiving a fair whistle. I think first percentage of time out shooting an opponent/quality of opponent is a much better indicator.",Jesmer8490,40,32,0.82

323,Is Gary Harris’ 3 point shot back?,11uyk1b,"Gary Harris used to be a very good young player. He could shoot, make some plays, and defend. Unfortunately, starting in the 2018-19 season he went from a good shooter to mediocre. From 2015-16 to 2017-18 he shot 38.9% from 3, but could not reach 38% in any season out of his next 3. In those next 3 seasons he shot 33.7% from 3 and lost a lot of his value as a player. Now though, he looks like he may have found his shot again. In the last 2 seasons he is shooting 39.9% in 100 games. He’s been above 38% in both seasons and this season he is at 42.5%.

Just to be clear, I don’t think the 3 point shot is the only reason Gary Harris fell off the map. He’s dealt with a lot of injuries and his 2p% also fell off. However, I do think he can be a useful player in a good team’s rotation if he continues to shoot like this.

330,Trae Young over the past 36 games: 27.1/3.3/10.3 on 46/38/89 splits (60.5% TS),11uwspm,"Steph 
Luka 
Dame 

Those are the only PGs I could take over Trae. I honestly don’t see an argument for Ja, Fox, Garland, or Hali, just because Trae had a rough start to this season. 

27 and 10 on good efficiency doesn’t just grow on trees and Trae has basically been doing that since his 2nd year at 20 years old, and now he’s playing solid defense too. 

With Quin Snyder as his new coach, he’s 
27/4/9 on 48/41/90 so far after 9 games. 

And obviously we’ll see what happens in the playoffs but as long as the Hawks aren’t facing the Heat, even if they lose in round 1 I think Trae will bounce back from his performance last year. 

Next year we could see an MVP-like breakout season from Trae…

332,"De'Aaron ""I'm F**king Nice"" Fox - Game Icing Stats (with video)",11uw3oo,"We've all seen Fox's excellent 4th quarter and clutch time stats, but I was curious: how many times this year has he been the one to actually ice the game?

I have a bunch of grading and lesson planning to do, so instead I just spent an hour going back through game logs and highlight videos.

I looked at two categories:

* Fox Game Winners - Fox scores the go-ahead bucket, and that is the final points of the game (I kinda cheated on this for a couple of them). I also looked to see how many of these were buzzer-beaters.
* Fox Daggers - I defined these as any game where Fox hit the Kings' final field goal, followed by some Kings FTs because of intentional fouling.

Here are the results:

The King have won 26 games by a single digit margin this year. In those games...

Fox has **7 game winners** (again two are a slight stretch but I'm counting them), a whopping four (!!) of which were buzzer beaters. 

* 11/5 @ Orlando, he hits the [unforgettable logo buzzer-beater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu1OZ4M6Cjc) to win it 126-123
* 12/14 @ Toronto, he drives to the rim and draws the foul with 0:05, and goes 1-2 to put the Kings up 3. On the next possession Siakim hits the putback after a missed FVV three, so this one is kinda cheating, but Kings don't win in regulation without that free throw.
* 1/3 @ Utah, [he hits the driving layup as time expires](https://youtu.be/tKXRDPZijNs?t=435) (call on the floor was that he didn't get it off in time, overturned on review) to win 117-115 (this is after Markkanen draws the 3 shot foul with 16 seconds to go and hits all three to tie)
* 2/8 @ Houston, [he draws the three shot foul from *Eric Gordon as time expires and hits all three](https://youtu.be/qaSTT5rsxqM?t=409), to win 130-128
* 2/11 vs. Dallas, he gets to the FT line three times in the last 18 seconds of OT, going 6/6 to win 133-128 (you could call this a bit of a stretch, but the Kings needed every single one of those six points)
* 2/24 @ LAC [he hits the go-ahead 2-point pullup jumper at 0:36 in 2OT](https://youtu.be/IUqEYXRn4HA?t=445), after creating that possession by picking Mason Plumlee's pocket. These are the last points of the game. Honorable mention for [assisting Monk's insane game-tying 3](https://youtu.be/bWc_-_DIFXA?t=105) to force OT in the first place. Kings win 176-175
* And of course, just the other night in Chicago, he [pulls up for an ice cold 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBA0ZhkLc1E) as the buzzer sounds to win 117-114.

The thing that really stands out to me: 6/7 game winners are on the road, a huge reason for the Kings' conference best road record of 21-13.

In addition to the 7 game-winners, he hit another 3 daggers, which I define as times where he hit the Kings' final FG of the win, followed only by Kings FTs on intentional fouls.

* 11/11 @ LAL, he [drains a turnaround fadeaway 2](https://youtu.be/1CQTw5I1qz0?t=432) with 0:32 to go
* 11/20 vs. Detroit, [he hits the two-point stepback](https://youtu.be/pMKX1-7jqa4?t=422) with 0:56 to go
* 1/20 vs. OKC, [he hit a layup to ice the game at 0:01](https://youtu.be/WMwjbMqEdls?t=437) (the Kings were already up 3 at the time, but it ended a flurry of OKC scoring)

Honorable mention for [assisting Trey Lyle's game-sealing dunk](https://youtu.be/cmhnaZDiwC8?t=561) with 0:37 to go @ Minnesota on 1/30.
