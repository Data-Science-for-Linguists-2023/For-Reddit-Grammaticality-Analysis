1,Bots and AI generated answers on r/explainlikeimfive,zh922v,"Recently, there's been a surge in ChatGPT generated posts. These come in two flavours: bots creating and posting answers, and human users generating answers with ChatGPT and copy/pasting them. Regardless of whether they are being posted by bots or by people, answers generated using ChatGPT and other similar programs are a direct violation of R3, which requires all content posted here to be original work. We don't allow copied and pasted answers from anywhere, and that includes from ChatGPT programs. Going forward, any accounts posting answers generated from ChatGPT or similar programs will be permanently banned in order to help ensure a continued level of high-quality and informative answers.

2,ELI5: Newton's Third Law of Motion,11vkt94,"Newton's Third Law of Motion states that ""Every action has an equal and opposite reaction"". Say you were an 200 lb man pushing a 250 lb object. You'd be putting in, say 260 lbs of force, going forwards. If my understanding is correct, it should be putting in 260 lbs of force on you backwards, which would mean as you push you are sort of just gliding backwards ig. Obviously there is something wrong with my understanding of Newtons Third Law of motion, so can someone explain what Newton's Third Law of Motion does",USA_Ball,125,662,0.9

25,Eli5 Different human species,11vcisq,"So Neanderthals and Denisovans are often described as other species (as I’ve heard it, that might be wrong idk) but the definition of species is the ability to have fertile offspring (to my knowledge). I’ve heard that Homo sapiens and other human species ‘boinked’ and also that many people have Neanderthal dna, I know those two facts might not necessarily be related but to me it implies Homo sapiens and Neanderthals had children who were fertile as to pass on those Neanderthal genes to modern day people.

41,"eli5 ""You're more likely to be in an accident in a red car""",11upy1v,"I heard this statement and it confused me. The explanation was more red cars have accidents than other cars. But surely that doesn't translate to ""I personally am more likely to have an accident if I drive a red car than a blue car today""? Assuming there's nothing inherently about red cars that makes them more likely to crash. I'm struggling with the maths theory behind it.

47,Eli5: Is there an equilibrium number of criminals?,11vbdv5,"So I tried to look this up and found very few relevant results. Essentially I’m wondering if there is an equilibrium point for the number of criminals in a given population. For example, say in the US there are something like 50,000 drug dealers. If suddenly 40,000 of them were arrested and given life in jail would another 40k people become drug dealers to replace them and if so how long would that take?

I’m basically wondering if there’s a viable strategy in the NYSE options market that you could profit off of knowing the upcoming of a large dividend.

It says on Investopedia “As a general guide, put options will increase slightly prior to a dividend, and call options will fall slightly. This assumes all else remains equal which, in the real world, is not the case. Options will start pricing the stock price adjustment (related to the dividend) well ahead of when the stock price adjustment actually occurs. This implies micro-movements in the option price over time, which are likely to be overwhelmed by other factors.”

284,ELI5: Convolution/Interpolation kernels and windowing in Digital Signal Processing,11q3rak,"Hi, I'm currently approaching Digital Signal Processing as I'm planning to integrate in my app a tool to visualize via spectrogram, and maybe in the future recognize via extracting audio features, a morse code input through open mic (that is, subject to all kind of background noises such as human voice, ambient sounds etc). I have a background with continuous Fourier Transform from my Signal Theory class at university.

Now, the actual problem is that the internet isn't greedy of material about the subject, but frustratingly enough all I could find expect you to have a solid knowledge of the subject, which I don't. So to be clear, my current task is the following:

**GOAL:** Allow the user to view a recorded audio file either as a waveform or a spectrogram, allowing them to smoothly (60+ fps) zoom in/out to increase/decrease level of detail about the audio, while maintaining a good quality of the selected visualization mode (**for waveform**: smooth envelope but without removing relevant details about the pitches; **for spectrogram**: allow zooming the timescale while maintaining a good image quality)

So, here's a suggestion I got:

>In either domain, a good (visually appealing with minimal information loss) way to smoothly zoom into a signal is to use a Sinc-like (windowed Sinc of some width) interpolation kernel for the downsampling. A Sinc interpolation kernel in either domain acts as smoother, summarizing local information. In the time domain, a Sinc interpolator of the proper width acts as a low pass filter suitable for anti-aliasing.

 So now, the thing is this: 

* In the time domain, if I want to downsample an audio file, obtaining  a sample of downscaled audio for each h (h stands for ""hop"" in my notation) samples, I proceed as follows:  I take a group of nearby samples, called a *window* (128 samples per window in my current implementation), and perform some elaboration on that window to compute the next downsampled sample. Then I slide the window by h samples and repeat until the next window doesn't exceed the original samples count.
* In the frequency domain, I have no clue how am I supposed to apply windowing (I'm computing the spectrogram via STFT)

So now, my questions are:

1. What the heck is an ***interpolation kernel*** anyway? Should I sample a sinc function centered in my window, apply a window (say Blackman-Harris) to it and then multiply the samples for such window (i.e. apply that locally)? Or should I compute the convolution of the whole original audio samples sequence by a given sinc function multiplied by a window, and then take a sample from the resulting signal every h samples (i.e. apply it globally)?
2. In any of these cases, since the tone of the morse code can vary and it's not known a priori, how do I choose an appropriate sinc *width*? And what is the sinc width defined as anyway? Is it the cut frequency? As in the sinc is s(t)=2w\*sinc(2w\*t) with w its width/cut frequency? Or is it the number of samples I keep from the continuous time sinc function? 
3. What does applying such kernel means in the frequency domain? My frequency domain representation of the signal is a matrix over complex numbers with a row for each frequency bin and a column for each samples window. Should I just multiply by the Fourier transform of the selected interpolation kernel?",BaffoRasta,1,1,1.0

I’m basically wondering if there’s a viable strategy in the NYSE options market that you could profit off of knowing the upcoming of a large dividend.

It says on Investopedia “As a general guide, put options will increase slightly prior to a dividend, and call options will fall slightly. This assumes all else remains equal which, in the real world, is not the case. Options will start pricing the stock price adjustment (related to the dividend) well ahead of when the stock price adjustment actually occurs. This implies micro-movements in the option price over time, which are likely to be overwhelmed by other factors.”

270,ELI5: Convolution/Interpolation kernels and windowing in Digital Signal Processing,11q3rak,"Hi, I'm currently approaching Digital Signal Processing as I'm planning to integrate in my app a tool to visualize via spectrogram, and maybe in the future recognize via extracting audio features, a morse code input through open mic (that is, subject to all kind of background noises such as human voice, ambient sounds etc). I have a background with continuous Fourier Transform from my Signal Theory class at university.

Now, the actual problem is that the internet isn't greedy of material about the subject, but frustratingly enough all I could find expect you to have a solid knowledge of the subject, which I don't. So to be clear, my current task is the following:

**GOAL:** Allow the user to view a recorded audio file either as a waveform or a spectrogram, allowing them to smoothly (60+ fps) zoom in/out to increase/decrease level of detail about the audio, while maintaining a good quality of the selected visualization mode (**for waveform**: smooth envelope but without removing relevant details about the pitches; **for spectrogram**: allow zooming the timescale while maintaining a good image quality)

So, here's a suggestion I got:

>In either domain, a good (visually appealing with minimal information loss) way to smoothly zoom into a signal is to use a Sinc-like (windowed Sinc of some width) interpolation kernel for the downsampling. A Sinc interpolation kernel in either domain acts as smoother, summarizing local information. In the time domain, a Sinc interpolator of the proper width acts as a low pass filter suitable for anti-aliasing.

 So now, the thing is this: 

* In the time domain, if I want to downsample an audio file, obtaining  a sample of downscaled audio for each h (h stands for ""hop"" in my notation) samples, I proceed as follows:  I take a group of nearby samples, called a *window* (128 samples per window in my current implementation), and perform some elaboration on that window to compute the next downsampled sample. Then I slide the window by h samples and repeat until the next window doesn't exceed the original samples count.
* In the frequency domain, I have no clue how am I supposed to apply windowing (I'm computing the spectrogram via STFT)

So now, my questions are:

1. What the heck is an ***interpolation kernel*** anyway? Should I sample a sinc function centered in my window, apply a window (say Blackman-Harris) to it and then multiply the samples for such window (i.e. apply that locally)? Or should I compute the convolution of the whole original audio samples sequence by a given sinc function multiplied by a window, and then take a sample from the resulting signal every h samples (i.e. apply it globally)?
2. In any of these cases, since the tone of the morse code can vary and it's not known a priori, how do I choose an appropriate sinc *width*? And what is the sinc width defined as anyway? Is it the cut frequency? As in the sinc is s(t)=2w\*sinc(2w\*t) with w its width/cut frequency? Or is it the number of samples I keep from the continuous time sinc function? 
3. What does applying such kernel means in the frequency domain? My frequency domain representation of the signal is a matrix over complex numbers with a row for each frequency bin and a column for each samples window. Should I just multiply by the Fourier transform of the selected interpolation kernel?",BaffoRasta,1,1,1.0

Is that the difference?

Because it almost seems like what Wells Fargo did was purchasing Wachovia than a merger of equals (Wachovia and Wells Fargo) because Wachovia's name just vanished altogether after the merger.

I’m basically wondering if there’s a viable strategy in the NYSE options market that you could profit off of knowing the upcoming of a large dividend.

It says on Investopedia “As a general guide, put options will increase slightly prior to a dividend, and call options will fall slightly.

271,ELI5: Convolution/Interpolation kernels and windowing in Digital Signal Processing,11q3rak,"Hi, I'm currently approaching Digital Signal Processing as I'm planning to integrate in my app a tool to visualize via spectrogram, and maybe in the future recognize via extracting audio features, a morse code input through open mic (that is, subject to all kind of background noises such as human voice, ambient sounds etc). I have a background with continuous Fourier Transform from my Signal Theory class at university.

Now, the actual problem is that the internet isn't greedy of material about the subject, but frustratingly enough all I could find expect you to have a solid knowledge of the subject, which I don't. So to be clear, my current task is the following:

**GOAL:** Allow the user to view a recorded audio file either as a waveform or a spectrogram, allowing them to smoothly (60+ fps) zoom in/out to increase/decrease level of detail about the audio, while maintaining a good quality of the selected visualization mode (**for waveform**: smooth envelope but without removing relevant details about the pitches; **for spectrogram**: allow zooming the timescale while maintaining a good image quality)

So, here's a suggestion I got:

>In either domain, a good (visually appealing with minimal information loss) way to smoothly zoom into a signal is to use a Sinc-like (windowed Sinc of some width) interpolation kernel for the downsampling. A Sinc interpolation kernel in either domain acts as smoother, summarizing local information. In the time domain, a Sinc interpolator of the proper width acts as a low pass filter suitable for anti-aliasing.

 So now, the thing is this: 

* In the time domain, if I want to downsample an audio file, obtaining  a sample of downscaled audio for each h (h stands for ""hop"" in my notation) samples, I proceed as follows:  I take a group of nearby samples, called a *window* (128 samples per window in my current implementation), and perform some elaboration on that window to compute the next downsampled sample. Then I slide the window by h samples and repeat until the next window doesn't exceed the original samples count.
* In the frequency domain, I have no clue how am I supposed to apply windowing (I'm computing the spectrogram via STFT)

So now, my questions are:

1. What the heck is an ***interpolation kernel*** anyway? Should I sample a sinc function centered in my window, apply a window (say Blackman-Harris) to it and then multiply the samples for such window (i.e. apply that locally)? Or should I compute the convolution of the whole original audio samples sequence by a given sinc function multiplied by a window, and then take a sample from the resulting signal every h samples (i.e. apply it globally)?
2. In any of these cases, since the tone of the morse code can vary and it's not known a priori, how do I choose an appropriate sinc *width*? And what is the sinc width defined as anyway? Is it the cut frequency? As in the sinc is s(t)=2w\*sinc(2w\*t) with w its width/cut frequency? Or is it the number of samples I keep from the continuous time sinc function? 
3. What does applying such kernel means in the frequency domain? My frequency domain representation of the signal is a matrix over complex numbers with a row for each frequency bin and a column for each samples window. Should I just multiply by the Fourier transform of the selected interpolation kernel?",BaffoRasta,1,1,1.0

From my understanding, during the Washington Mutual collapse, Chase came and scooped up it's assets where as in Wachovia's collapse Wells Fargo merged with Wachovia.
Is that the difference?

Because it almost seems like what Wells Fargo did was purchasing Wachovia than a merger of equals (Wachovia and Wells Fargo) because Wachovia's name just vanished altogether after the merger.
