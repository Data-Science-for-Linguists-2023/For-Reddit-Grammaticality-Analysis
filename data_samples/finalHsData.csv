0,Can't wait to leave my 'friends' behind once I graduate,11vu3qi,"They've made my life an absolute misery, self centered idiots who worship Andrew Tate and refuse to believe basic science. I get insulted for just being myself, they act like they care about me but they couldn't give any less of a fuck. I spent my whole 18th alone because they miraculously 'forgot' about it, and then didn't even bother making up for it. Wasted hours for them in a different city before telling me they couldn't go 3 hours after waiting and just didn't bother to tell me. Racist, support the murder of the poor girl Brianna Ghey, they are just horrible people. I can't wait for them to just fuck off and I can meet some decent human beings",sewer_dweller_,1,5,0.86

3,What do I do about my friends I feel so anxious,11vnuwz,"Hi, I'm an 18-year-old currently in high school. 

I'm in a trio friendship and honestly, it bothers me so much because I know I'm the least liked (yk how trios never work out). It's obvious too and I know I'm leaving for college in august but for the next few months that I have school, I have to deal with this. 

I feel like i always make my decisions based on what they think and i crave their validation so much even though they don't make the best decisions and they are super judgy. I feel like they are constantly judging me and bitching about me. 

It honestly sucks and I feel so alone. I hate going to school because I hate being in a constant state of anxiety and just feeling left out. Even the smallest things they do like call without me or walk off together makes me feel so sad. Idk what to do. Since my final exams are coming up i decided i was gonna skip some school to study but honestly i feel like I'm mostly skipping just so i don't have to deal with this.

7,Advice for making female friends,11vdoic,"I’m a male junior in high school currently. I have a lot of good friends and a few really close ones, but they all are male, and I don’t have any real female friends. I want to make some female friends soon, since the end of high school is approaching, but I’m not really succeeding. It’s not that I’m socially awkward, since I can talk to girls just fine, and during forced group settings like class table groups, I can make good conversation with and make girls laugh. The problem is beyond these settings, I don’t have much else. These same girls that I’d talk to during class for long would not even say hi to me in the hallway. I’m a part of many clubs at school, but they all happen to be mostly male, which is why I haven’t found any female friends from these clubs.

10,Never had a BF before and there is someone I want to talk to but there isn't much opportunity.,11veesg,"I'm at a new school, and started about a week after everyone else did because that's when I finally got registered. One day in class the teacher gave me and another student a pass to go to the counseling office to sign the syllabus, and we went together to do so.

I hadn't noticed him yet since I didn't really pay much attention to the other people in the class and I was sitting at the front and now know that his seat is in the middle of the room. From both of us having to go sign the syllabus, I was thinking that he also must be new to the school.

Finally seeing him I actually thought he looked nice, but we didn't speak at all from when we went to go sign the syllabus until we got back to class. It's been months and a new semester started. He was in a new class with me, so now we have two classes together.

The first day of that class, we could choose our seats. The desks are singular but are put together to form a group. I chose a seat first and he came in shortly after, he first came over to where I was and slightly pulled up the chair from the desk beside me but last minute chose to sit at another group of desks already filled with a few other boys. I honestly don't think he knows them, or that they're friends at all. This is because I don't hear him really speak that much to them or at all and one of them didn't know his name, I know this because one day he was absent and the teacher noticed that he was not there when he was taking attendance and one of the boys who sits at one of the desks referred to him as the kid who sits at the other desk. (He might have made friends with the new student who came into the class a few weeks ago though.)

I've wanted to talk to him since the day I first saw him but I don't see much opportunity since we only have two classes together and we don't sit near each other, and these classes aren't the type that you get out of your seat often in.

The reason why I really want to now is that because last Friday when it was the end of the day and I was walking in the hallway and everyone was leaving to go home, I noticed that he had a hoodie on that had Feitan (from an anime) on the back of it. It really made me feel excited because I do like Hunter x Hunter and that's something we might have in common.

But I'm actually afraid to approach him because it seems like he's almost always serious and I don't know if he would want to speak to me if I tried. I don't have good social skills and my awkwardness tends to spill out when I'm leading a conversation. I'm also worried that he might be dating someone else, I haven't seen any signs of that but it's another thing that I've thought about.

How can I find a way to speak to him?",Mariiuyu,0,2,1.0
11,Research about books!,11viati,"Hello everyone, 

I hope this community will help me with my goal. 

I'm an Italian teacher and I've always been curious about the ""papers"" high school students have to write about books they have read, as shown in a ton of movies and TV serials. 

I would be curious about how the teacher organize this work,  i mean: does he/she present the book in classroom? does he/she gives the student materials and notes to work with?

I already do this in my classes, but in Italy is not that common as a work routine, so i wished to discover more about this.   


I'm always interested in knowing and trying out different way to do my work, so i'd be really happy to discover about how to make this.

12,My teacher literally bullies students and the school is aware of it but does nothing???,11v5qs2,"I have a teacher who is literally a bully. They made fun of my classmate for their appearance and calls us students stupid constantly. They target one student in my class who has missed school for medical reasons BECAUSE they missed school. They pick on kids with anxiety and tease them for it. We’re all too afraid to stand up to them directly. They have given open rants about people kneeling for the national anthem, how vaccinations cause illness, and how pronouns are ridiculous. When I went to my counselor to switch classes, I was told that it’s just their personality and they’re nice once we get to know them. Well, it’s March now and this teacher has not changed.

Anyway, I said I’ll join since it’s a pretty good deal, a lot less than $10 a month for regular premium, even though I know it’s technically not allowed. However, the friend only accepts online payment and basically refuses to take cash when I offer it. My parents don’t use online payment that much, and they think it’s too much of a hassle for such a small amount once a month, so they want me to give her cash. My parents tried to give them the money through Zelle after kind of a back and forth conversation between me and my friend, but when they typed in the number, there wasn’t a name that came up, so they didn’t trust to send money through it. My parents now only want me to give cash, but my friend still only wants online payment.

19,"I have a crush on my English teacher, I feel like if I tell her I'll feel better but I feel bad about it. Should I?",11v5n6y,"I've had a crush on my English teacher for 2 years now, I eat in her class for lunch everyday day, I give her a hug everyday. I just wish I didn't like her like this, she's so nice to me. One of the most respectful people I've ever met. She's very beautiful also. But the reason why I don't wanna feel this way is cuz, A she's in her 40's and it's weird, B what if I tell her this and she hates me, or feels disgusted, C if she found out she would probably never wanna talk to me again out of feeling uncomfortable. like I literally feel so gross 🤢. Very soon ill never see her again, and I can't date her obviously, so I'm just stuck feeling this way about a woman much older then me forever. Or at least until she really starts to look her age😬. Idk what to do 😭. Before I graduate should I tell her? I feel like I'd feel so much better if I did but Ive tried giving hints before and she seemed so uncomfortable. God why do I feel this way ugh😑.

Edit: And also, she gives everyone hugs. Everyone likes her and wants to speak to her. Lots of kids like coming to her class everyday, and there's also a second teacher in that class cuz it's an sped class. So it's never just me and her during lunch. I'm a big conspiracy theorist so I just talk to her about my theories and interesting things I find out cuz I like to research during lunch. And that's it. I give hugs to everybody cuz they offer it, it's not like thats a thing we don't do. And I have personal counselors I talk to cuz of my anxiety disorder. I know it seems like I have a lot of issues, (for those of you that read my replies) it was all caused from taking medication that was doing more good then harm. I wasn't always like this just fyi. So she gives me hugs also knowing the issues I have. And I said until she starts looking her age cuz I'm not into ""old people"". I'm not a fetisher. I don't like that, she looks great for her age. And either way its her actual personality that made me like her the most. Y'all can chill out now, I'm not a creep🙄.

24,My HS prom sucked and was completely awkward. My date and I hardly ever spoke at all that night,11u24fr,"It’s been at least a decade and I still remember how lousy my prom was. My first top picks/ people I really wanted to go with already had a date, so I was pretty desperate. Wanted the full high school experience, and told myself if I didn’t have a date I just wouldn’t go. Well, I eventually asked this one girl from one of my classes. We hardly knew each other, but I think she was just as desperate as I was to go to the prom with someone. 

Used my mom’s car and took her out to eat and we even went go cart racing which I thought was pretty fun. But as the night went on I noticed things started to get more awkward and we really didn’t say much after that. I remember getting a little lost on the way to the prom venue and her getting visibly annoyed.

&#x200B;

in history class

when the teacher assigns an essay

&#x200B;

and wants the cover page to be an exact format,

&#x200B;

so they provide the class with a microsoft word document of the cover page, you just need to enter your name, and date of birth in place of the ones in the document

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

in the history class I was in, the teacher would take points off your essay if you didn't use the page he provided,

&#x200B;

the simple thing I wish I had done,

keep the cover page in this separate word document,

&#x200B;

and create a new separate word document for the rest of your essay

&#x200B;

this will save a lot of head ache

and will eliminate the risk of messing up the format of the cover page,

&#x200B;

and when you need to print them out, print them separately,

i was accused of talking during a practice exam. this exam is not graded. these kids who don't like me decided to sabotoge me and falsely report me to the teacher saying i was discussing with a peer during the practice exam. i did not talk at all during the practice. my peer said generally that the practice is going to be hard when the formula sheets were being passed out yet i did not reply to that. my teacher was not present during the exam, only a substitute. now, the vice principal has gotten involved and has put an infraction on my record saying that she cannot prove i cheated but that i am presenting group work as individual work and is putting a level one offence on me. she refuses to disclose evidence, just that she talked with the kids in the class and that she has ""substantial evidence."" though, when the kids were notified today, most were shocked and surprised and did not believe that we talked at all. i vehemently repeated during the first meeting that i did not talk, yet now, the vice prez is saying that i ADMITTED to talking. i don't know what to do anymore. i explicitly said i did not talk multiple times and that it was a misunderstanding. also, i told them that i was being bullied by multiple kids in the class and they are reporting me because of that, but they did not take my concerns seriously. we have another meeting tomorrow with my parents and they are ready to defend me, but scared to anger the vp or admin. right now, it is just one person's word against another.

for some background, there have been incidents of the vice principal saying the ""n"" word and the teacher is universally hated for not teaching and preparing students for exams. again, i did not talk nor cheat.

please help me with this situation urgently as my meeting is tomorrow. ps: my school does not have an appeals process. i will have to escalate it to the dean if tmrw doesn't work out which i don't want to do.",Useful-Knowledge-218,0,3,1.0

Dear High School Student,

We invite you to participate in a research study aimed at exploring the reasons why high schoolers dislike math. This survey is part of a research project that seeks to understand the factors that contribute to math aversion among high school students. Here is the link to the survey: [https://forms.gle/n4GvhwYKmZmh712p6](https://forms.gle/n4GvhwYKmZmh712p6)

The purpose of this survey is to gather information about your experiences and perceptions related to math. We want to know what you think about math, what you find difficult about it, and what factors may influence your dislike of the subject. Your honest and thoughtful responses will help us gain insight into the issues surrounding math aversion among high school students.

Your participation in this survey is entirely voluntary, and you may choose to skip any questions that you do not wish to answer. Your responses will be kept anonymous and confidential. Only the researchers involved in this study will have access to the collected data.

We appreciate your willingness to take the time to complete this survey. Your participation will help us gain a better understanding of the challenges high school students face when it comes to math.

Thank you for your participation!

42,Struggling to make friends even as a junior,11t9th2,"I'm in band and play a sport (so trying to join more activities kind of goes out the window because I'm already pretty busy) and do my best to talk to people but most of them have their friend groups and aren't that welcoming to conversations even if I try. I'm not sure what to do but on the bright side, my grades are great. I just feel like I'm missing out on a social life so it's hard for me to be happy even while I doing some of the things I love. Haven't really went out with people besides anything arranged through school or been to birthday parties since 5th grade. I'm not naturally very social but I really enjoy being with and talking to other people. I think two issues I'm having are I'm too worried about what other people think about me and I'm not very similar to my peers (despite being asian at a largely asian school and doing other activities, although my sport takes up so much of my time) so there's less for me to have conversations about. I'd like to make plans with people at least occasionally but how do people escalate their friendships to that level and actually figure something out? Any tips for talking to people in general? I don't understand how people just go up to each other and talk so much. I think I have a false perception that everyone is so sociable because I don't realize that there might beother people that might be standing in a corner alone, but I'd like to improve, at least before I get to college.",Worried-Dentist-857,1,1,1.0

47,Is she most likely to end up w a black boy/male?,11tfm07,"I met her when I was a junior, and she was a sophomore. She was in my Art class. I believe we sat next to one another due to assigned seating. 

I remember her as having what I perceived to be behavioral problems (but as someone who has a mental health english course with her this year, it seems like there have been improvements in regards to that. I’ve noticed that the two times wherein she seemed bothered by something - like I think once bc I was glancing at her - she just quietly got up and went downstairs, I presume to see the school conflict resolutions guide. This was toward the start of the school year.) 

I remember that when I had art w her, she openly disliked the teacher, and would complain about little things the teacher did (like saying “y’all” once.) However, she was not one of those students who was good at biting down her frustrations and simply focusing on her work. Even though I had the class a year ago, I do remember she was sent out maybe once or twice (to go see someone in the office, I think, or that someone had to come in. She never got violent, but just wasn’t someone who I remember as having actively been ‘calm.’) 

I remember that she could get annoyed with me, one specific incident that sticks out is that she seemed upset or irritated (well, both) about how I sound white (I am black, and she is - if I am going based off her appearance - 1/2 black 1/2 white.) And also bc I once asked the same question twice. I think she “understood” that I deal with internalized racism, and that this really bothered her even though I *assume* that one of her parents is white. 

I remember her mentioning complaining about racism in the office as well? 

I seem to remember overhearing her mention in her junior year that she did not pass Algebra 1, or something like that - like that she is behind in math. In class, she sits next to this girl who I think is potentially mixed with black (either a white passing biracial or 3/4 white 1/4 black - or just a white girl who’s parents are into black culture as I remember this girl’s white looking friend mentioned her mom played Rihanna for her when she was little and that her hair is or was naturally curly so I assumed we friend was mixed with black.) 

I remember that my former boyfriend (either an ISFP or ISTP) actually seemed to know who she was when I mentioned her, and said she seemed like a “bitch” even though I don’t think he ever sat near her. 

She has a black boyfriend (or had a black boyfriend, even though we go to school w white and Asian people.) 

She actually performed recently in my school’s performing arts assembly. She and everyone else there did a good job (seemed to know the moves - she is a part of our school’s dance team, though she is technically a little overweight/somewhat overweight.)

 Now the thing with this teacher... she speed runs through exercises whenever giving examples on how to properly solve them, usually one topic = one solved exercise on the board (as an example) and then we move onto the next topic. Now the tests are usually comprised of all the advanced equations we haven't practiced, since our textbook only provides medium-difficulty tasks. 

We wrote a test today and there was one chapter in the textbook we skipped and yet she proceeded to put it in the test, claiming she showed us ONE example on how to solve it. Nobody had it written down, yet she didn't accept any complaints and just shut us all up.

So first is English 2 honors, I'm in English 1 honors rn and I go back and forth between a D and C so yea not the best position rn so yeah and there no real way to study for that


Next is algebra 2 honors, now I have a C in geometry honors but back in 8th grade I got straight As in algebra 1 so hopefully i do good there, I know it one of the easier to study but like I don't know how much more advanced it gonna be 


Next is physics, note this is regular physics not AP physics since we not allow to take that till junior year so I'll have to wait till then. I know it involves math but idk like how it works exactly or the difficulty. I made usually straight A's chemistry honors so hopefully it won't be too much harder but idk and it seems easy to study but I think most ways to study is for AP physics in which idk if that a good idea cause it cane skip beyond basic stuff but can better prepare. Would like to know which is better to study, I also plan to take AP physics junior year

Next is AP World history, now I'm in honor world geography and get straight A's and I also did back in middle school taking advanced history courses and I look at a few questions from previous AP test and I already know the answer to quite a decent number of them. I'm more concerned about the homework in general and how much work exactly it is, I study history in my free time so yeah.


Th other 3 are straight foward so I won't get into detail  but they are AP computer science A, PE, and Spanish 2

Anyways yeah I wojld like to know what the work is like exactly and also is there any website or YouTube channel that goes over these things and are easy to follow.

Also mostly for AP world history but would be helpful for future to but is there anyway to take practice AP  test like from previous years online?

My daughter panicked & I told her to remain calm because he’d more than likely bump her grade since he did assign the wrong essay & took points off and that most teachers would bump it. She wanted to ensure that she was going to see if she could do anything before the grade was final to earn that 0.01% to get a B-. She reached out to him and told him she was at a 79.99% and asked if there was anything she could do to earn the 0.01% to get her grade bumped to a B-. He said no. I told her I was surprised because most teachers are willing to, but ultimately it’s his decision & not all teachers are flexible and he may feel that whatever grade a student gets it’s what they earn. So this year my youngest daughter has a friend that has him as a teacher. The semester just ended and her friend said that she absolutely loved that teacher. She said he was so nice because she had a bordering grade and he bumped it up for her. I want to email him about it because that’s unfair for him to do it for some and not others.

78,Worried son won’t be able to dual enroll,11qu63d,"So my son is a Highschool Junior he has been interested in dual enrollment since August and his meeting for dual enrollment is tomorrow. However his school is the only school in the county that requires students who are interested in dual enrollment to have at least a B average in all of their core classes and at least a 2.5 GPA. My son didn’t do well his sophomore year but he is currently doing a lot better and passing his classes with A’s B’s and a C and by the end of the school year he should have a 2.5 GPA most likely higher.

He told me today he had a pre meeting with the dual enrollment counselor and she told him that he will only be able to dual enroll history,science,math and his electives and not do full time dual enrollment like he wants to do. ELA is the only class he has a C in and it’s not even a low C it’s a high C like a 77% average. She says if he still wants the college credit for ELA he can try to take AP French literature (or it was something like that) but the class costs $100 and he only gets the college credit if he does well on the final exam which is also $100.

I know how excited he was to Dual enroll and I was excited for him especially when he told me that it was basically free college, I’m happy he has this opportunity because I never had this type of opportunity when I was in school. I want him to be able to fully dual enroll and the way he explained it is that for his senior year his only Highschool class would be English and the rest of his classes would be college classes which makes no sense that’s like a waste of gas.

I’m assuming the counselor will explain more about it tomorrow but is there like anything I can do. I really want him to be able to fully dual enroll I’ve never seen him so excited to talk about school and one C shouldn’t be that bad especially if the rest of his grades are B’s and above.",psusensus,5,2,0.75

84,Advice needed on a teacher I have,11qt58r,"Hi all!

I’m currently a junior, Female 17, in high school and I need some advice on a dilemma I’m having with a teacher of mine.

Please bear with me and read through this entire post. I need all the help I can get before it goes too far. 

He’s my science teacher, and I’m pretty sure it’s not because I’m a bad student, I always get A’s and try to keep to myself. 

Here are just a couple of the most noticeable things he does (my friends have observed him doing these things and told me): 

* He’s almost always staring at me even when he’s not teaching, I can sometimes tell out of my peripheral vision that he’s looking at me 
* If he’s talking about something with me, he’ll sometimes make me stay after class just to finish the conversation
* He subtly insists that I sit in the front of the class, even though we change our seats frequently
* When taking a test, he’s always talking to me or still staring at me or trying to initiate eye contact
* Every time he’s talking to someone else, he always looks at me too, even when I’m not a part of the conversation
* Even when he is teaching, he doesn’t call on me normally because I’m quiet in general but he continuously makes eye contact with me, which has honestly taken a toll on my confidence and I’ve stopped making eye contact with a lot of my teachers and peers and friends because of how uncomfortable I’ve been getting
* Some of my friends have told me that its a little unfair how much more he pays attention to me compared to everyone else, which I understand I think

Please let me know what I can do about this situation. I really used to like him as a teacher and wanted to ask to be his student aide but I just don’t know how comfortable I am around him anymore. It’s come to the point where it’s disrupting my education because of the part where he talks to me during tests. 

I will accept any and all advice! Thank you all.",Ill-Boot-7670,1,1,1.0

However, everyone including my math teacher says most universities don't like it if you don't do precalc and he said business math is not as well known and universities probably won't know what it is, even though I feel like stats is a lot more usefel for me as I don't wanna do anything STEM related in the future and I'm planning on doing AP stats in g12, regardless of whether I do pre calc or business math in g11, as pre calc or stats and business math can be used as prerequisite for ap stats)

HOWEVER, since then, I’ve been getting SEVERE anxiety about it (chest pain + increased heart rate + bad butterflies + jitters). It’s genuinely affecting my health and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been to a dance with a date before, but my physical reaction wasn’t nearly this bad that time. I struggle with a little bit of social anxiety, but this is so much more than my usual levels. Maybe it’s because I only want to be friends with him; maybe I’m not mentally/emotionally ready to go on a date.

The anxiety is bad but bearable. I’m not sure if I should stick it through or back out. It’s senior year and we’re going to different colleges (he’s studying abroad) so I would feel bad for backing out after he finally worked up the courage to ask me before graduation.

Thoughts on what I should do? At the time of typing this, I’m leaning toward backing out by letting him know about my severe anxiety regarding this.

i just received a letter from my school letting me know that i’ve been dismissed from our chapter of the NHS for my GPA of 3.432 last semester. (for anyone who’s not aware, you must maintain a GPA of 3.5 to meet NHS’s standards)

let it be known that i understand NHS is a total scam that just looks good on applications for college and scholarships, and that’s exactly what i need it for. i’m graduating in june and i’m relying on scholarships and grants to cover the cost of school. my parents can’t afford to pitch in and i work 18-25 hours a week to put away money for school. not that reddit needs to hear my entire sob story but i miss out on a lot of things other teens don’t: sleeping in, concerts, parties, and hanging out with friends are all out of the question because of my rigorous course load (comprised of AP classes…no, our GPA isn’t weighted) and work. it makes me so angry and sad that all of my hard work is for nothing, especially so close to graduation. 

beyond the financial aspect, i’m insecure about the rumors that will swirl if i just suddenly drop out of NHS. my friends are in it, i’m involved in current committees. i’m mortified that there will be talk of my sudden disappearance. 

on the bright side, there is an appeals process. the only thing is that i just didn’t meet the standards of NHS which i understand. i’m not the exception, but i am an exceptional student and person. i feel like i need to advocate for myself. does anyone here have experience with appealing dismissals? 

i really hope that i’ll be able to plead my case and not just end up making a fool of myself. i’ve worked too hard these past 4 years to not be recognized for it.

102,Hey y’all - I’ve run myself into a problem!,11ptrwt,"I’m almost done with junior year, and it’s been my most brutal year. I got diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and OCD all at once over Christmas break. The first semester was okay, but my anxiety kept getting worse. I am on meds now and meeting w a therapist, but I have missed a lot of school.

I’ve always been a sick kid - I missed the first two weeks of school from Covid, then a few scattered days throughout the first semester from anxiety/depression-caused illness. Now, in the second semester, I had a bad breakdown. I missed two weeks of school, returned for two weeks, then missed another, and now two weeks later, I am sick with the flu.

My parents just tell me to do better, but even when I try, I can’t seem to do any better. I go to a hard private school that I’ve had trouble with since I started back in first grade, but my parents say leaving is not an option. Now, I have so much makeup work that it takes over my everyday work. I can’t seem to catch up, or when I do, then I just miss out again.

I don’t know what to do. When we talk to the school, they just tell me to speak to teachers and stay after school. I do just that. I talk to my teachers, ask for help, work that I’ve missed, and do anything else that would help. A few teachers get back and actively help me, but the others say they will, but never do. I complain to my parents, but they just say it’s me being lazy. My physics teacher is the worst about this - I ask him every class period for access to the work I missed (he doesn’t post it) and notes I missed, but all he says is that he will get back to me. Others in that same physics class feel the same, but the school just ignores it. 
When I do go after school for classes like math, there are usually so many people in there that I never get help. I’ve had this same teacher since 6th grade and have never been able to learn from him. He’s way too fast - I’ve asked him to slow down, and talked to the administration and my parents, but everyone brushes it off. 

The amount of work I’m given on top of my missing piece is so hard to complete. I live an hour away from school, so I have early mornings, and with all of my homework, I have late nights as well. Because of this mess, I barely get any sleep, which I know isn’t helping! 

I’m at a loss as to what to do. Sophomore year was my best year, but with the loss of my grandma, two pets, a best friend moving away, and a teacher leaving the school bc of corruption within the school, junior year has been the worst. All my parents tell me is that I will fail, and that I’m lazy. In two classes, I’ve been able to keep up with A grades, and even through all this, I won a silver key at the scholastic awards for writing, but I’m still told I’m just lazy.

I’m going to talk about what happened today.

This is Sunday (no school). Today I woke up and called him because I missed him. Things escalated and we started having a phone make out session. After he said he has to eat breakfast so I let him go. Then an hour later I call back expecting to talk to him but now he says he has to eat breakfast. He wanted to watch Harry Potter clips. I felt betrayed so I didnt get to talk to him. I got mad and didn’t text him after. It aggravates me because I know next thing he has to leave for church with his parents at 12. Usually he’ll get home at 2 and eat and lie in bed. (I would get time to talk to him usually) However today he went to Costco and went home at 3. He fell asleep till 6. He usually spends time with his parents every night and gets tired after. 

I feel very cramped if this is the right word. I never get the full energized boyfriend. I also feel the reason why we are so sexual is because he’s too tired to talk.

I remember I met her in freshman year (she and the other girl - who was guessed to be an ESFJ on this sub, but who I actually think may be an ENFP - were sophomores.) She and this other girl came up to me when I was alone at the chemistry table and had no one to work with. I think they felt bad.

I remember my impression of her when I was a freshman was that she was nice and intelligent. She tended to get v high scores on tests in the class, yet had astoundingly low grades (a C in Chemistry) bc she did not do homework. I was told by a girl who had had classes w her before that she was like that when she was in middle school, too, or that she had always been that way. 

I’d say she was like average looking from what I remember (just literally average, face and body wise. She is what I think most people would agree to be a 5/10, objectively. Latina yet white passing, once mentioned to me that that was why one of her boyfriends who was black liked her or something. She was aware of the fact that she was white passing/looked white.) Overweight but not insanely so (you could see by looking at her that she was not “skinny.”) I remember she once mentioned the only guys who have asked her out have been black and said before she wasn’t sure if it was offensive or wrong to say. It’s odd since we actually don’t live around black ppl (we live around white and Asian people. She suggested that she’s had different people w crushes on her, or who were attracted to her, but that only black boys had asked her out.) 

I remember she once mentioned that she once got a truancy letter (I think in either 8th or 9th grade) for like skipping class to spend time w her boyfriend. Something like that

In her junior yr during online schooling I remember she gave me advice like a lot/a fair amount? Tho she once posted to her spam that she unfollowed someone bc they asked her for things a lot and didn’t seem to care abt her. I realized I might be someone doing that, texted her and asked abt it. She said yeah and that she was sorry and should have j “told me.” That she gets tired sometimes. I started asking her abt how day was after

In her junior yr I remember she took a lot of AP’s and her grades in them were low? Like D’s and F’s low (on Zoom.) Her highest grade was in Pre Cal, a C (or maybe it was an A idk - actually, I do think it was an A.) I remember she struck me as being someone who probably should have just planned to start at community college.

I remember she tended to kind of sound sad sometimes on her private spam acc and like she regretted certain things idk? Like she once mentioned in her junior yr, when she was taking a lot of AP’s, that she feels our school isn’t the best and sometimes regrets going to it or choosing it over another school (she went to the same school for middle and high school - my high school also has a middle school.) 

She eventually ended up cutting me off (or “splitting ties” with me) after I vented on my private spam acc abt how I felt certain people had ignored my feelings in a situation w this guy (she followed it, as did our friend who sent the message saying it was time to split ties. Neither accepted my apology.) The situation w the guy partly started bc I mentioned in a group chat we had. the other girl from chem I wasn’t sure that he was a co founder of our org. She said ask him, I said I had no way of contacting him she gave me his number

I remember I once showed her the comment section on our sophomore class t shirt during online schooling (we had hundreds of comments where people were hating on the “sophomore universe” shirt.) she responded and seemed to think that the comment section was bad, I remember she said “wow. Your class is terrible. I’ve never seen anything like this before where the entire class is like this.” I mentioned that a lot of people hate our class or have before. She remembered this, as I remember she kind of mentioned it I think when she was arguing the guy’s side (below)

I texted him (ppl who read it said it was polite) and he got defensive and attacked my own position. It led to me feeling suicidal, I voice call messaged the friend from chem crying abt it and admitting I felt suicidal. The cops were called over to my place by a friend of mine

It caused org drama, I was told it was likely people in the org would be biased in his favor and 3 org members said “sides would be taken.”

Two weeks later we talked again and I kind of brought up the issue but didn’t blame her for it. She mentioned after it happened she texted him and apologized for going me his number. She actually “argued his side” when I mentioned friends of mine and a teacher said it was wrong and that our org had a bad approach. She claimed she wasn’t biased. But she was.

I mentioned another org member tried to argue his side and that the teacher and my friends said the person’s argument didn’t make logical sense. She defended their argument. Actually, even though I think that she was wrong for doing what she did, I think that she is the only person who effectively argued his side (still biased, and I suggested so when she asked. And I think I was right about that.)

I remember two things she said that pissed me off were her agreeing w the person from the org who suggested that me telling people abt the situation was “gossiping” and defending the person’s perspective when I mentioned that the person brought up that me complaining abt the BLM spread to the yearbook squad was supposedly a good reason for the guy to have some hard feelings toward me (he made the spread.) And she said after that that I “call a lot of things that aren’t racist racist”

I was upset at the time which led to me making a spam post where I mentioned I feel certain people ignored my feelings or side. I didn’t implicate I was talking about her. I was actually technically referring to people who were in the organization. I didn’t even directly mention the situation. 

But our other friend from chem texted me and said that she sent screenshots of our conversation, that they saw my spam post, that it was best we “split ties.” I apologized, they both cut me off and blocked me anyhow (I had mentioned to the girl I’ve been describing that this is how I had recently taken to handling situations where someone upset me so much I no longer wanted to talk to them.) The other friend from Chem sided w the guy blatantly even though she seemed to be on my side before the screenshots situation. The other friend from chem might have done it bc I laughed and apologized a few months before when she said she once came home from summer camp and learned her cat died. But no one specified or thoroughly explained their reasons, so I am actually uncertain. 

I seem to remember the other friend said smthn abt me “ruining the girl’s reputation” but when I texted someone in my grade who hangs out w people in their grade a lot (they are a yr older) they mentioned that “no one in their class cares abt them” (that neither girl who is being described happened to be popular.) 

I do think that the fact that I had vented on my private spam account months beforehand about having lost BSU president to the most popular guy in her grade and being the one who did all the work after I was appointed was a factor in why she decided to split ties, even though she did not blatantly take a side when I mentioned this to her (but did seem to feel bad for him, and kind of made me feel bad about it in a way but I don’t know how to explain it?) 

I never did have the impression that this girl was popular, even though our other friend talked about how I was impacting her “reputation” (and making her “look like a bad person.”) She did not have as many social media followers as some people in her grade had (not thousands or even like 600,) and did not seem to immediately know grade-wide gossip (like I mentioned to her that people within her class were upset about the popular boy who won BSU president over me winning vice president of their grade, and about this goofball kid winning president of her grade, and she didn’t seem to already know this.) 

The guy (who is either an ESFJ or ESFP) quit the org a few months later (5 months later, in October 2021) when his junior yr ended. I believe she is still friends w him. I started holding a grudge bc of it. I once saw her and said “oh no!”

She saw me in the halls a few days later and stared at me, a slight glare but also j looked irritated. I stared back, without fear, bc she had her “stance” and I have mine. In her senior yr she started dating this half black half white boy who I feel is likely introverted, and who I did not find attractive even though I am a black girl.

I ended up having PE w her in the last semester of her senior year (she was class of 2022.) I remember she made a face (not a disgusted one exactly but idk) like she “knew” who I was by my hair. She was fake toward me once or twice (I had never noticed in freshman yr that she is fake. She may have changed.) For example, I once missed the ball and she made a face like “ouch” like she felt bcd (but it was also like fake I don’t know.) She also said something to me on her last day but I can’t remember what, I just think I sort o ignored her. When I think of her now I actually don’t like her. 

She also once simply looked amused when I was complaining to my friend about men of my race, I think bc of how often I complained abt internalized racism (in PE, 2022.) I remember she didn’t “come off” like an adult.

But they were middle school ones so it wasn't committed. We started dating over the summer to our senior year and we are both committed to each other. However during the school year, we experienced a lot of problems, how he has to sleep early and is always tired talking to me. I also had high expectations and I cried a lot because they weren't met. He became very busy for us and I couldn't keep up with it. So we broke up. I can't handle avoiding him because it hurt even more. So we talked as friends and I had less expectations from him. I became better at accepting that he has to sleep early. I focused on myself and did other activities as well. We are both okay, but we both still really like each other. It feels difficult because we are both experiencing senioritis.

129,From a current Senior & UPenn'27: Don't focus on In-School Clubs! Free Consultation 03/18 @2PM,11ooymg,"Now that I'm a senior, I'm reflecting on the advice others have told me when I was a freshman in H.S. The biggest one: Join as many clubs in 9th grade and narrow it down to a couple. I don't disagree but I think there is more complex factors that isn't said to this advice.

1. Leadership: The main point of narrowing down your clubs to 1-3 is to increase your chance of coveting a leadership position as you maintain all of them throughout your 4 years. This is key for colleges. It demonstrates your dedication, community involvement, and ability to lead others. A hidden factor is also the *size of the club*. If you're joining popular school clubs with dozens of people, it's harder to get leadership position because you're competing with sm other people.
2. Uniqueness: This is when I say *explore clubs outside of school*. Countless high schooler across the country will be part of the school's newspaper or student union BUT what about a non-profit that you start ground-up for teaching others how to code or an internship at a well-known museum? It might seem difficult to accomplish but it's not rocket science. Put in the time, research well, and most importantly - reach out and talk with others. Most people are happy to share their experiences if you just say hi and ask.
3. Passion: Named as the secret formula for college applications, Passion Projects allows one individual to stand out in a crowd of 50,000+ applicants. This ties well with both uniqueness & leadership as it demonstrates your creativity, perseverance (starting something on your own as a teen is hard), and passion (your interests and your character).

Whether you're a current freshman or sophomore, it's not too late to start.

If you want to learn more about Passion Projects and have questions on how to start your own OR want help on making ideas, JOIN **GYEF NYC** (insta @ gyefnyc) on 03/18 @ 2PM with Steven Li, incoming freshman to **UPenn Wharton** who started his own passion project and raised 40k for giving low income students internship funds.

138,what third quarter out of the way I guess I should reflect on my classes,11o7tku,"I said second semester would be better but now I'm just trying to keep my grades equal, guess I'll say how things went since spring break has started now

Chemistry honors: 86, last year I ace this class but this semester haw been alot harder due to stochiometry, I was aceing everything but then I drown. It Just a mess and honestly I think it something that more AP chem level Imo but anyways I'm surprised my grade wasn't worse. We now started gases and shit and when our teacher show us Boyle and Charles law I think it was call and when the teacher  review it it seem so easy but our teacher had to go somewhere and the assignment was confusing, first Boyle law was confusing and literally like everyone was confused and when I did the math, the predicted and measure volume were the exact same and the labels were confusing, then we did Charles law for a day and somehow everyone seem to understand it better but it just confusing, o know I can do algebra so I guess it was label weird and like I either got answers showing an indirect relationship or something like (insert number here) Kelvin equals negative volume do maybe I'll ask the teacher about stuff when break ends but I'm

Drawing 2: 69, went from B's to a D because we did like one project this quarter and I did jack shit cause I was scared of idk it a long story and what worse my grade is gonna drop since 4 grades are due today and I only did one which was this little paper, I hope it isn't in because otherwise I'm completely unprotected by 3 1's in the grade book

Spanish1: 90 something, was confusing but end up recovering to first semester levels 

World geography honors : maintain and continue to make A's 

English 1 honors: 69, English is hard, yeah basically things were ok but I didn't do a  project at all because I didn't know what to writer about do yeah, then barley finished another project and that was ok but then  there a paper I didn't do do to confusion situations but hopefully it wasn't a bug grade, I hope it already in the grade book cause I wrote another ""essay "" and IT was kinda half ass but we only had 1 day to do it, suppose to have like 2 I think but our class fell behind and alot f people didn't finish so hopefully that brings me to passing

AP computer science principles: 95, I don't deserve this grade, I don't understand coding at alk and it not completely our fault cause there supposed to be a computer science class before this but it was full so our school put freshmen with little to no coding experience into this one and the teacher basically gave us free 100s for the first month or two but NOW we have to compete like a semester worth of school work in half the time.


Geometry honors: 78, semester was kinda unfair, first it threw proofs at us which I suck at then circles which I also suck at so yeah and the last thing we learn was 10 tines easier and save me and I'll take the 78.

141,Are we really in the wrong?,11o5851,"Kind of a big rant here, but I really would need some advice. So basically, me and my best friend (who I will call Polly), made this new friend (who I will call Alexis) at the start of the year. Polly and I have been friends for 1.5 years, and we have been friends with Alexis for about 8 months. Alexis is one of those people who you can't really have a proper conversation with.  At the start of the year, she at least tried and put some effort into our friendship, but now is starting to put less and less effort. For starters, she never initiates the conversation and neglects when either Polly or I talk about something. She never reveals her scores and expects us in a way to share them, she dismisses our accomplishments, views everything as a competition, does not talk about general teen talk, and she never really shares anything personal with us. When we try and share something personal, she always just goes on her phone, or interrupts us and dismisses it. She also takes forever to change in the locker room, and gets angry when we don't wait for her, but also gets angry when we do. This was kind of annoying me, so I stopped putting so much effort into her. However, about a month ago, Alexis lashed out on us about excluding her, and not treating her as a best friend. Keep in mind, we were not trying to exclude her at all. We always sit with her at lunch, we have introduced her to our other friends, I invited her for my birthday party, and we always try and initiate conversations. We were just a little pissed on putting in so much effort for someone who was not returning it back.

Anyway, fast forward to yesterday, were the three of us were at this after-school event. The after-school event was supposed to be a fun event where students could socialize, eat, dance, and participate in fun activities. We would also get some extra credit for one of our classes if we attended. Alexis dislikes all of the above and was only there for the extra credit. She asked me and Polly at the event if she could join us, and we said yes. We didn't really want to, but we didn't want to be rude. About five minutes in, we were all kind of in this awkward place, where none of us were talking, we were just awkwardly staring, and since Alexis didn't want to eat, dance, or do the activities we were just walking around. Polly and I couldn't really talk too because then she would make a fuss about how we always exclude her. She was already in a pissed-off state since she did not like to socialize and dance, so her negative vibe kind of just spread. Anyway, Alexis sees another friend and talks to her for two minutes. AT this point, subtly, Polly and I just go in the other direction and start having the food and vibing to the music. The rest of the night, we never ran into Alexis, and she never found us. However, today, she seemed really pissed and mad at us because we left and excluded her. I get that we did technically leave, but is it really our fault?",Beneficial-Menu7517,3,0,0.43

146,"I have a 2.75 GPA, is my future fucked?",11n86ox,"So as the title implies, yes I have a 2.75 unweighted GPA. I am currently a junior in hs (writing this on 3/9/23) and I'm coming up on the end of the first quarter of my second semester. People always told me growing up that grades were important but I just kind of shrugged them off cause yk, who wants to do homework. But when I started my freshman year, my teachers told us that this was an important year, grades-wise, to set ourselves up for a good GPA and a good future. At the time, I again, shrugged this off because I'd heard this all of my life and nothing had really happened to me because of it. And before I go on, I want to explain that I'm not just some hopeless kid who struggles to get D's, in elementary, I was in the honor society, and in middle school, I did fairly well. As for standardized tests, I've always excelled in them. I've never gotten below a B in any state test (I live in Florida so the FSA and EOC). But the problem is that I never tried. I never tried to get good grades and I never tried to raise them and I never cared for them because my only concern was passing to the next grade at the time. So I guess I never saw the value and the benefits of having good grades and maintaining them. But at the end of my sophomore year, I was just like, huh, I wonder what would happen if I devoted some time to do at least half of the homework that I was given, and my grades skyrocketed. Right then and there I realized the importance of getting good grades and most importantly, turning in homework. So ever since then, I've been actually trying in my classes. Right now I'm taking 2 AP classes (AP English Language and AP US History) and I plan to take 6 next year since the ones I have now aren't really challenging. This is my first year taking any AP class but now I'm absolutely devoted to getting my grades up and showing at least a smidgen of self-improvement and an upwards trend in my grades. Before I was maybe a (C) to (B-) student but now I'm easily a B+ student, and I still think I could get better grades but yk, but I also have a life. I took the PSAT twice already and in freshman year I got a 1040 (1120 SAT conversion) and in sophomore year I got an 1140 (1220 SAT conversion). I took the SAT on March 1st so I'm really praying that I got a 1300 but if I don't, I can take it again, and then for sure I will. (When I get my score ill update this thread :) ) But I know that even if I get a 1500, I won't be able to become what I want to be. It sounds silly now but I've always wanted to become a surgeon since I could remember. I'm taking an EMT course at my school that started my freshman year and I get my EMR or EMT certification next year. Funny enough I've always made sure to do extra well in that class since that was my passion but I'm worried now that it was all in vain. I've done calculations and for me to get a 3.0 GPA, I would have to get about a 3.7 GPA my senior year and if you've read anything above, you would know that that would be next to impossible. But at least if I had a 3.0, colleges would at least look at my submission and I think then I would have a chance because I've always done well on standardized tests. And I do not want to go to just some ratty-tatty alleyway college, I just want to go to a respectable school, somewhere I won't be embarrassed to tell family and friends and somewhere I can build myself up and, as cliche as it is, follow my dreams. So my question is really, what can I do? What colleges should I realistically apply to or aim for? Can I still follow my dreams of becoming a doctor and if not what other career choices could I realistically aim for? And most importantly, what can I do now to help improve my grades and my GPA as a whole?",Nextaus,42,31,0.92

149,Honestly what do I do now?,11nriqy,"The story goes all the way back to November’22 so I’m just gonna shorten it a bit. Just know a lot more happened than just this and it’s worse than you think.

Racist kid tries to hit me,no detention
Principal told us to both stay out of each others face
Racist kid doesn’t listen and doesn’t get any punishment 

(I get detention for the smallest things)

Again,racist kid comes to FIND ME and called me a racist slur and tried to hit me (every time I had witnesses defending me) principal still doesn’t want to punish her and decided to yell at me as if he’s insane but what he DIDNT know is that my older brother was in a phone call with me the WHOLE TIME and heard everything how he treats me like shit. He and his friends immediately drove to my school and picked me up. Scolded the secretary because they treat me the same and we left. 

That kid wants to “beat me up”

I can fight but honestly it’s so hard at my school,there’s cameras and u immediately get caught because my school is small.

 The principal is a pussy and heard from someone that my family knows everything about how he treats me and said he refuses to have an appointment with us because he knows my mom is gonna flame the hell out of him. We’re definitely gonna report this and complain somewhere higher than the principal because they can’t get away with this again. The kids at my school are filled with shit,and my school simply sucks.

I also don’t have many friends and kinda by choice due to the fact i am moving schools in the county. He has like a whole friend group in 3rd period and when i talked to him once for a class assignment he just seemed short and pissy with me.

I threw a party and invited a lot of classmates. We will call our little problem child 21 because that's how he act like and talk like. So he was one of the classmates that came. Now 21 while we were off doing whatever was snooping through my house he found my mom's stash and took it. That's not the first time through the second time he stole a cart. So the drama all start when my best friend breaks up with this girl. 21 starts harassing her and stolking on snap. I tried to be the middle man and keep everything calm for awhile. It all hit the fan yesterday when 21 threatened my friends 6 year old nephew. I was fucking done at this point so I came to school mad as shit and 21s friends overheard the conversation. So now 21 wants to go toe to toe. The problem is that I'm 6 foot tall and a twig and I'm also blind in one eye. I just don't know what to do. I already reported the ordeal. But he will start jumping my friends and harassing them if I don't do anything. I don't wanna end up I'm County jail because I'm 19 and I don't need an assault charge.

158,How to get my firing overturned?,11nq6tn,"I was just fired as English Teacher and Head Basketball coach as my school. The school is grieving after one of the nicest kids in the school, a Sophomore named Jessica, was murdered my a classmate. Jessica played and started on my basketball team, along with her sister Jennifer. The thing is, Jennifer has always been difficult. Her grades were always terrible, she had a bad attitude, and she’s a snob. However, my mentor who had a soft spot for Jessica, always got her off the hook and looked out for her. It came out that Jennifer was bullying and borderline torturing a classmate. She made her do her all her work, made her wait on her hand and foot, even made her bow in her presence(not kidding). This went on all Senior year and basically resulted in the girl she bullied having a mental breakdown. This girl later decided to get retribution. Jennifer is out of state, so she decided to punish her through Jessica. She waited for Jessica to get home from a recent dance and stabbed her. Jessica died, but the school blames me. Our Principal says that because my mentor and I “held a torch” for Jennifer and protected her, we enabled this behavior. She said without the behavior, there would be no retaliation. They said I’m gone and am never to step foot on this campus again. This hurts because I went to this school and played on multiple championship basketball teams.",cunnx67,3,0,0.14

She spends the whole class talking to this one kid who is a complete delinquent and literally DITCHES class to hang out in her classroom all day, and ignores us except to yell at us. She yells at us to “sit down and be quiet” and then laughs affectionately at said delinquent boy when he literally breaks her equipment right in front of her. Then she tells us how pathetic we are.

I HAVE reported her. THE WHOLE SCHOOL has reported her, including parents. Nobody cares. 

Because she is so insane and ridiculous my class has started just laughing every time she talks. This is not how we behave in other classes and not how we used to be in hers but we are done. We are so finished. She’s cracked us.

She is arrogant enough to think that we are not laughing at her but at some classmate of ours, and then she scolds us for ’bullying’.

I am DYING to tell her how pathetic of a teacher she is and who we’re really laughing at.

186,Seeking Student Advice: Best Ways to Study and Top Recommended Study Apps,11mcdhl," 

Hey there, fellow students! As we all know, studying is a critical part of our academic journey. With exams and assignments constantly looming over our heads, it's important to find ways to make studying more effective and efficient. That's why I'm reaching out to this community for some advice.

What are the best ways to study? Are there any study tips or tricks that have worked for you? Do you have any favorite study apps that you'd recommend to your fellow students? I'm curious to hear your thoughts and suggestions.

As for me, I've found that taking breaks every 45-60 minutes helps me stay focused and retain information better. I also like to use flashcards and practice quizzes to test my knowledge. However, I find that most of this isn't enough, so I'm also developing an app where I can create mind maps, and flashcards, and use space repetition and active recall in the same app, let me know if you'd like to talk more about it.

But I know there are plenty of other ways to study and apps out there that I haven't tried yet. So, I'd love to hear from you! Share your study tips and recommendations for apps in the comments below",papanwqq,0,2,0.75

Last year I was freaking out about doing the exams for my dream high school and was overflowing with joy when I got accepted. In my country, a high school starts with 10th grade so that's where I'm at a year later. I have been studying at this high school since last September. It is a public school in Central Europe and considered one of the prestigious ones. Yet, I found myself regretting my choice quite a lot and I'm not sure whether I can do something about it.

The first 2 months were great. I made a lot of friends and my popularity status was far better than I've ever expected. I became one of the ""class clowns"" and it felt like a refreshing start for a new chapter of my life. Our assigned teachers were acceptable. Learning became more fun because my class is bilingual, which means a lot of english classes through the week. I love english so that was nice for me.

After the warm welcome in my school, things started to get worse in every sense.

In our english classes, we often do group assingments when the teacher forms groups randomly. I remember being in a group with one of my classmates. Her english is very advanced and she's got a great accent + pronounciation. It came down to me to discuss the subject with my group members and that classmate stopped me throughout and mocked my accent in a VERY rude manner. I can't explain how much it boosted down my ego. It caused me to be insecure about reading something aloud in english classes. It's far better now but sometimes I was legit shaking before reading my part.

Soon enough, my grades and overall intelligence became a trouble for me. Since the school is considered prestigious, it's quite hard to get accepted. Most of those who do are intelligent people who learn quickly. That is NOT my case. Let's just say, half of my classmates are those who would fall within the ""nerds"" range. I feel so incredibly dumb any time I talk to them because they either put me down or I embarass myself by saying some stupid shit. I feel like they tie my extroverted nature to not being smart. I have many friends, but for the dear life I can't talk to the nerds because they judge me really easily.

I started having worse grades after that. It became hard for me to pass some exams succesfully, especially chemistry and math exams. I felt like a failure and had absolutely no interest to learn. I became depressed and doubted if I will ever belong in this ""smart"" school.

Things got better after a while, but then another problem occured. PE classes. I have no idea why our school is so keen on physical education. We have PE three times a week and our teacher is horrible. She acts like we're in a damn army. Our PE gets graded solely on our score, not participation or trying your best. Which means that if you're generally bad at sports, which I am, you basically won't pass the classes. We did gymnastics and I felt like Dwayne Rock after finally getting a good grade. But after that, we started volleyball and I literally can't play it. Our teacher doesn't show us how to properly throw the ball across the gym, she just orders us to do it. I started having literal panic attacks at home a day before the classes. I am so anxious to perform anything because I fear like I'm going to embarass myself infront of all my classmates. It's terrible. A few weeks ago I had a panic attack before throwing the ball and excused myself to the bathroom. I lied that I suddenly feel sick and my stomach hurts.

The school assingments keep getting harder. I had covid for the last week and now that I'm healthy I don't understand any shit from chemistry and math that was explained in school when I was sick. I don't know what I'm going to do, our teachers are inconsiderate and will just give me more tests and exams and from PE I'm going to get graded from volleyball next week. I feel like I'm locked in a loop plus high expectations from parents won't help. I have considered changing schools but that will be hurtful because I've made so many great friends. I have also considered studying abroad for 6 months to get a break but it costs thousands of money and my parents are doing bad financially so I could never afford it. I'm not sure what I can do at this point I'm supposed to stay in this school for 5 years (because bilingual graduation from high school requires more school years) and I'm already unstable in the first grade. 

Any help would be appreciated because I legit cry all day and I'm not far from starting the wrong path. Vaping, smoking, drinking, partying, drugs are a very common occurence in our school and I feel like if I started doing that shit maybe it would recover me from everyday problems I face. But I know how badly it would hurt my life. I just worry that I will fall down significantly if I'm not able to fix my issues in school. Thank you.",thoughtful_redditor,2,6,0.88

193,Freshman year ruined my GPA,11lklch,"It's as simple as the title says. I was really going through some personal issues in my freshman year and struggled with almost 90% of it being online, leading to abysmal grades and at least 3 failed classes.  I'm currently a 17-year-old junior looking to become an accountant, but my cumulative GPA is dreadful. I'm taking 3 AP courses right now, but I'm absolutely terrible at AP Calc and don't feel confident about passing the coming exam.

 In my freshman year, I ended with a 0.88 cumulative GPA, before attempting to get back on track and raising it to a 2.1 by the end of my mostly B average sophomore year. I don't think that I'm academically stupid and I've done pretty well this year getting almost all A's, especially in my business-oriented classes like accounting, but my current 2.1 feels like a looming shadow over me. My entire family thinks I've got amazing grades and my classmates seem to believe so too, so it makes me feel like a fraud every time someone asks me or mentions grades to me, so much so that I sometimes just blatantly lie about them or exit out my tabs if someone has a chance of seeing them. 

There are obviously worse situations people have been in when it comes to grades, but I feel really worried about not being able to get into a good college and then disappointing my parents or being looked down upon by my friends. I've heard some people say that colleges don't care too much about freshman year or that they look for improvement just as much as consistency, but I'm not sure about how much weight that holds. 

If I managed to maintain A's and B's with maybe a bit of C's would I be able to crawl out of this? Has anybody else gone through something similar? How did you recover and how'd things turn out?",robqzc,19,19,0.89

198,Can I switch subjects mid-way on my senior year?,11ltejf,"So at the start of my year, students who planned on taking advanced courses (like medicine/engineering/cs) were required to take 2 APs in order to be able to get into a uni with the desired course (as per the ministry in the country). Our school offered AP Calculus and AP Biology, so I had no choice but to take the two. Further, those who took AP Calculus were mandated to take AP Physics, but dont have to sit for the collegeboard exam. The first semester is now over, and I got an average of 93.9% with straight As, except for physics being 78 (sad)

Today morning the counsellor entered our class and informed us that this onligation about the requirement of AP courses are no longer required. I was really frustrated because my goal is to take computer science and I dont need biology at all. The stress and hardword i've put into getting a 98% in biology just went directly to the drain- but I don't want to complain about it much lol

My question here is, actually first let me give you context: The other option students had instead of Bio (for those who didnt plan on taking the advanced course) is Astrology. And the other option for physics is Business or ICT. Those two subjects are way easier for me, and since I dont need bio or physics (im planning on doing software engineering) I want to switch to those two subjects, as I need my report card average to be at least 95% (my parents want it). So my question is, will switching subjects be affecting my chance of getting into a unicersity? I spoke to my counsellor and he advised me to still take the subjects I was already doing, because otherwise my report card would show a half-credit for the two subjects I planned to switch. I don't want to be working and stressing out on subjects I don't really need, but at the same time if getting half credits for the subjects is going to affect me, then I'd have to rethink thrice

edit: the reason I might be oddly too stressed (you guys might probably wonder why im so stressed with just 2 subjects idk no judgement pls) is because 1, this is actually me first year doing any AP course, 2, I have some personal conditions I have to deal with on my own and therapy doesnt really help, and 3, some of the students in my class just slack off which makes it hard for the teacher to stay on track, hence we're behind plan and we really have to go on a fast-track, meaning we're sent videos to self-study and when we go back to school we start on the next lesson with no revision because theres no time, and to top that off we have useless homework tasks given from other subjects",baguuu_,0,1,1.0
199,Which decade will I talk about in the 2030s?,11lkyzw,"I’m almost 18. I actually had to turn off IT: Part One (2017) earlier today because I was already feeling sad (I actually read the book and finished it yesterday which is part of why I had plans to rewatch it) but also bc it reminded me of middle school and got me thinking about how different everything is now. I remember that in middle school, I saw IT (2017) twice in theaters - once w my father, the other time w a girl who I don’t hang around anymore. I remember I watched sharp objects after and was rlly into the film and felt to be one of the best horror movies I’d ever seen. But even though I liked it this time (and didn’t finish, but will rewatch Friday) I was still just thinking about how I can’t “relate” to the characters anymore. And comparing it to the novel. 

I’ve changed a lot since the pandemic started. I’m no longer super obsessed w one specific decade. I am also always quite tired and am noticing that a love of reading has replaced my interest in watching films and tv all the time like I did in middle school.

Myself and my other teammate (let's call him Michael) asked our teacher to have a two person team. However, he put us with another student (lets call him James), making it a 3 person team. Fast forward 180 days, and James has done exactly nothing to contribute to the project and myself and Michael are finished with the project. It's not that we ignored him, it's that we gave him various tasks to do and after it not being started weeks after we initially asked him, we did it ourselves. I am confident (I can assure you that you would agree if you knew the context) that we will win the $3000 which will be distributed three ways by our teacher on our behalf. The problem is that I don't think it's fair that myself and my teammate have put in half of the work and are not given an equivalent proportion of the reward, while James freerides to claim a third.

Many of the people at my school on the other hand were annoying and would make fun of me for stuff like my race, being ""weird"", liking and playing Nintendo games (mainly Mario), etc. I still remember one time when a group of ""friends"" were only friends with me until one of them got their driver's license and they all of a sudden decided to ditch me for no reason. The way my classmates treated me made me feel like I was socially awkward.

234,Community Service Hours in High School Research Survey,11k39ab,"Hi!

My name is Madeline Ruzicka, and I am a student from a high school in Wisconsin, who is taking the class, AP Research. My class requires that I perform a year-long research project and gather data for my research paper at the end of April.

Right now, my research is focused on required service hours that are mandated for graduation from high school and how they influence people’s willingness to continue with volunteer work in their young adulthood. 

I am looking to collect data from the classes of ‘13, ‘14, ‘15, ‘16, and ‘17 from students that were required to complete community service hours in high school in order to graduate.

I’m messaging this group to ask a favor: would you be willing to fill out [my survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwg2QBgGVifBKvcFmJakmDzllqYGz-F-zjeqhyyIwuuA4KXw/viewform?usp=sf_link) about your experience in high school and motivation to volunteer? Or, if you know anyone who completed community service hours during high school, if you could send them [this link?](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwg2QBgGVifBKvcFmJakmDzllqYGz-F-zjeqhyyIwuuA4KXw/viewform?usp=sf_link) It is relatively short and would take about 5 minutes for you to complete.

I am a 16 year old girl who lives in the Netherlands. I love acting and drawing, and to just be creative!  I am going to be an acting/drama teacher, and my new college program will also learn me how to create shows and entertain people. I have a dog called Froemer (boemer dog) and she is a small black and white dog-

Some other things that are kind of 'funny' to work with-

The meaning of my last name is head (in dutch), so you are able to make some jokes with that (please do you worst- I want to laugh), I chose subjects to follow in school that are everything but creative like biology and science, but i don't plan to do anything with those things in the future.

for context, i am a sophomore and i’m taking Algebra I. for some reason i passed algebra I 2/4 quarters my freshman year but my old school didn’t provide the credits on my transcript so i just restarted fresh.

^ unfournately for that, i did not past algebra the first 2 quarters this year since i was in the hospital 90% of the time due to sickness from me or family. We are in Q3 ending this friday and i have a 59, meaning if i don’t get a 60 i fail the class.

I am already taking summer school to get the remaining credits but in order for that i needed to pass algebra this quarter and next, and now i am on the verge of failing. i don’t wanna take algebra 1 as a junior and i feel like i will be considered a failure and i have no chance at college.

what should i do to fix this issue?

As for what happened:

(We'll call the boy R). We had lunch together on Saturday as we agreed and he was very nervous. I showed up dressed pretty casual because I wanted to keep it friendly and didn't want him to think it's a date or anything(even though he's a cutie) and he was wearing a button up shirt and slacks which I found adorable, I showed up 10 minutes early hoping to be there before him and he was already sitting at the table and I think he got embarrassed that I knew he was there so early.

He pulled my seat out for me which I loved and he stuttered as he greeted me. We sat and spoke about our families, our hobbies our childhoods and I discovered a really interesting person! He is in an Aerospace group based in Brisbane, he's a Corporal in the Air Force Cadets and wants to be an Aerospace engineer. He started explaining the mechanics of fighter jets and how the RAAF ordered new twin-engine stealth jets or something like that and I couldn't wrap my head around it but I loved watching his eyes light up and his smile as he rambled on about it using words I've never even heard before.

He said that his sister studies law at the university where his Aerospace group is based and he visits her every time they have a seminar and he showed me really cute photos of them together when he was little. He told me that his Mum is battling breast cancer for the second time and she seems to be healing so I gave him my sympathies but wished him the best on her recovery.

One of my friends walked past and locked eyes with me so I waved at her and she just nodded back with this weird look on her face. I don't think he noticed her but I heard my phone ding right after she did and I knew it was her but I didn't check it because I'm not rude.

We sat and spoke for nearly 2 hours until the waiter asked us to move on because we were sitting there too long and there were other people waiting which we both chuckled about. We agreed to split the bill on text the day before. As we said goodbye, I leaned in to hug him and he stepped back so I quickly wrapped my arms around him and said ""No you don't!"". He went all stiff and awkward but laughed with me and said ""D-do you wanna do this again sometime?"" and looked down at me like a convict waiting to hear an innocent or guilty verdict. I went ""Hmm well..."" and I saw the disappointment washing over him but then said ""Of course I do, I had a great time getting to know you"". He gave me the cutest smile and nervously said ""Oh, well, good."" I laughed and said ""I'll see you at school"". We said bye and I walked back to the carpark and called Mum to come pick me up.

Now here's where the problem started:

While I was waiting, I looked at my Insta to see the message and yes it was from her, we'll call her (W). She wrote ""What are you doing with that creep?"". I immediately sighed and felt not only angry and offended but worried because I knew it was gonna be straight down-hill from there. I replied ""What exactly do you mean by creep and why do you care who I hang out with?"" She replied ""What I mean is why are you hanging out with that pinkie-dick weirdo and I care because I wondered what was mentally wrong with you when I saw you sitting there with him"". I didn't reply because I didn't want to start a feud with her but I refused to apologize or validate her nasty comments so I didn't know what to say. I immediately felt very anxious imagining the drama that was awaiting me when I returned to school.

When Mum came to pick me up and asked how my ""date"" went I said fine and looked out the window, so she said ""What happened???"" and I just kept saying fine but she wouldn't let it go so I said ""Look Mum will you just let it go!?"" so she stopped and we stayed silent.

I started to cry as we pulled up at home so she gave me a hug and I explained the situation to her and showed her the DMs, she said to just explain that you want to be friends with him and if she doesn't want anything to do with him then that's fine. But I still didn't reply because I knew she could screenshot the DMs and send them to anyone. I said ""I don't wanna start getting bullied and lose all of my friends"" so she said ""Yeah I don't know darlin', it's hard isn't it?"".

I felt bad about not standing up for him(and myself) but knew that it was only gonna get worse if I responded and probably cause him more embarrassment. I'd love to give you the ""I don't care what anyone thinks of me, I'll stand up for what's right!"" speech that everyone's hoping for but in reality I was scared of how my social life was gonna be at school now that W has an issue with me hanging out with ""the pinkie-dick weirdo"". I then saw that she screenshotted the DMs and set it as her story.

I was so afraid that I didn't go to school on Monday but I texted him to ask how his day was and he said it was fine and nothing more but I think he just didn't want to bring up how it really went and asked why I wasn't there, I told him I was sick and that I wouldn't be there tomorrow either and he bought it, or at least pretended to.

I went back on Wednesday and saw her with my group of friends in roll class and I sat down and said hi as if nothing happened as I usually would. One of my other friends said ""Hey, how'd it go with pinkie-dick? Did he show you how big it really get's?"" and they all laughed at me. I said ""He was much better company than any of you are"", then W said ""Howbout you find somewhere else to sit then?"". I put on a brave face but inside I was devastated and terrified of what was to come, I said ""Fine, thanks for showing me all who you really are"" ""*Fine, thanks for showing me all who you really are*"" she repeated back to me in a mocking voice, they laughed at me as I walked away, sat at the back of the room and got on with my day.

2 of my classes had one or more of them that day and they just gave me dirty looks and ignored me, luckily I've got plenty of work to do on assignments so I stayed in the library to work on them during break time while they went to their usual spot and probably bitched about me. I saw R in there and he could tell I was upset but I tried to brush it off because I didn't have the heart to tell him what was going on or rather why it was going on. I just politely asked him to leave me be to work on my assignments and he looked worried like he thought he was the problem or something. As we were exiting the library, some asshole said ""Hey pinkie dick!"" and put his finger through the zipper of his shorts. I immediately said ""Well if you're so proud why don't you let it hang then!?"" he looked at me shocked so I went ""Come one then. Show us! I wanna see it."" He got embarrassed and said ""Just, shut up bitch"" and walked away as people laughed at him. I looked back at R and I could see he was upset from his comment but he smiled at me for my reaction.

Yesterday we had English which was the worst because all 5 of my friends from that group are in there and so is R. As we were getting our stuff outside the room, people were saying things like ""Can you even feel it inside you?"", ""Your babies will be short and have tiny dicks"", then W said ""I don't think that little thing could get her pregnant anyway"". Half of the class laughed and one boy said ""Leave her alone"" but he instantly got verbally abused from every direction so he went quiet.

Poor R walked away with his head held low and I lost my temper and shouted ""Shut the fuck up!"". Then everyone laughed so I walked away. Just before I did the teacher opened the door and called my name so I sped up and ran around the corner, I just slid to the floor and sat there crying. The teacher's aid came to speak with me and asked what was wrong so I told her everyone is picking on me because I'm hanging out with R. ""Why are they picking on you just for hanging out with him"" she asked, I gave her a look equivalent of ""Are you stupid?"" but I didn't wanna say ""because he has a tiny dick"" so I just kept balling my eyes out. After a minute or two she walked me back and we completed the lesson. R was in there when I got back.

He got up as soon as the bell went and rushed out the door before everyone and being 5ft 1in I couldn't get past everyone so I lost him when I got out. I asked him to meet me in the library and he didn't respond or show up. It's Friday morning in Australia and I didn't go today because I hate the thought of being there and I texted him explaining what happened and he hasn't responded.

Please tell me what to do, I feel so alone and ostracized, it must be how poor R has felt throughout all of highschool. I'm so worried about R and I don't know what to say to him and everyone else. Please help me.",flavourlessjellybean,42,5,0.69
288,summer courses,11gu5jk,"hi! i was wondering how you all went about bringing up the idea of taking highschool courses for credit during the summer to your advisor/counselor. my schools different than a traditional highschool, it’s early college, but we still have set requirements for what highschool courses we have to take. currently i’m in my second semester sophomore year and my last required highschool course is geometry. i could’ve taken it this semester but my advisor chose to put me in a college math course instead. for a few reasons i just really don’t want to have to wait until next school year to take it (convenience with scheduling mostly- if i took it there would be entire days in my schedule i’d have to come to campus just for an hour long geometry class, and it’s kind of hard to get someone to drop you off at 1:00 and pick you up at 2:00 or whatever the timeframe is). my only other option
would be during our little spring/summer semester we do from may-june but it’s very unlikely that they’ll have a geometry course in that time. i would really like to get the credit over with and i’m pretty good with math so i thought i’d be easiest to just take an online course over the summer, but everytime i’ve brought up the idea, my advisor dismisses it without really giving a reason. if anyone has any experience with taking summer courses id really like to hear your input!",deelikesbees,0,1,1.0

290,Should I upgrade my iPhone SE (2020)?,11gsxnx,"I got my iphone SE (2020) in November of 2020, so I've used it for about 2 years and \~3, 4 months.

I've always used android phones before my SE so I went for a lower end iphone at the time to test it out. In the end I fell in love with the UI/UX and it's really easy to use.

But now it's 2023 and the design also looks very outdated (I'm not a big fan of the oversized bezels) and it's missing some features I would like to use (the 0.5x camera for example). And my macbook, airpods and ipad are all new but it feels like my iphone is stuck in 2017 (even though I probably use it the most out of all my devices except for my mac). Not to mention I only get around 4\~5 hours of battery per day.

Should I get a new phone? (I'll probably buy the iPhone 15 pro max when it's released in September and use it for many years), but I feel kind of guilty for wanting to upgrade after only \~2, 3 years, but everyone seems to have a newer looking phone.

291,Honors Precalculus Help!,11gn4vs,"&#x200B;

Hi,

I'm a high school junior taking honors precalculus and I'm having hard time when it comes to taking tests. Even if I'm able to do the practice problems at home and understand the concepts on my time, I'm still not able to execute that in my test. My teacher is also giving me a tough time because she makes me feel like I'm inferior to everyone and is also unapproachable so I don't feel comfortable asking her for help either. I recently got a tutor and my dad whose an engineer also spends time with me to review my coursework yet I'm still struggling. Can you please give me so tips, advice, and resources to help me fix this? Please let me know as I'm a junior and I'm scared for my future.

Also, my school has recently updated the honors precalculus curriculum to make it more challenging in order to help kids become better prepared to take AP Calc AB and BC. The topics we are covering are supposed to be challenging as they delve deeper into Conics, Polar Coordinates, and Limits. I hope to get better and feel more confident for the future topics.

292,Issue with spanish teaching at school.,11gdtoq,"Ive been taking Spanish at school for 3 years. We are a small class of 4 girls. The rest of the class picked a different subject. We do not have a proper teacher. We are face timing a teacher from another school. She lives far away and cant come physically. This makes it incredibly hard. She talks to us, and sends us assignments to do. Her teaching ways are already really disappointing. We have 3 hours of Spanish each week and have been for 3 years. But still i know basically nothing. I feel like its way to hard for me. I can only count to 10. And she already wants me to learn the clock. I feel like im rushing, she gives me assignments to read a full text and then answer questions about that text. When i only understand like 3 words. Ive told her this so many times, i feel like i need a little more time. And i need to learn the basics first. But she does NOT understand. I use so many hours each day On duolingo and other apps and stuff to try and learn Spanish. I dont have time to do this out of school. Im 15 and i also have a job. It gets to much for me. And in my opinion i should learn spanish at school as they promised me. Ofc i need to do a little at home. But my mom says that i need to learn Spanish on my own. She wants me to do full time studies. I do not agree, when i take a Spanish class with 4 students the least they should do is teach me Spanish. (Also i do not at all want to learn Spanish. The only reason i took the class is bcs in the next grade you are required another language. I want to learn my mother’s language but ofc they did not offer this at school. Most schools offer both german and Spanish and tons of More languages but here i am only with spansih as my pick)",HalboAngel,2,2,1.0
293,I got valedictorian and I feel nothing.,11fq8k6,"I feel like an asshole if I say this to anyone in person, so I’m just going to say it here. 

A couple days ago I was told by my principal that I am valedictorian. I keep trying to feel something for it but I can’t feel anything but guilt. 

My school base’s valedictorian off of the top 3% of students by GPA. There are 7 of them this year and I’m pretty sure I’m number 6, but I’ve never felt more stupid standing in a room with the rest of them.

To put it plain and simple, they are smart and I am not. I’ve had to work HARD to get here. Endless hours of peer tutoring till I cried about every day, having the #1 (my best friend) student review any papers I wrote, pretending like I knew what was happening in class when I actually had no idea and hoping the rest wouldn’t catch on to my slowness. I have the lowest ACT out of all of them; a 24 in a sea of 30+’s. 

Today I found out that one of the salutatorians cried her eyes out after finding out she didn’t make val. I wish I could switch places with her because I know she’s smarter than me and honestly deserves it.

I’m just an average student who was pushed by her parents to have a perfect GPA and to take all the hardest classes. How can I stand on the stage at graduation giving a speech pretending to be someone I’m not? I’m the same as the students that won’t be on stage. 

I also don’t mean to sound like an ungrateful prick. I understand the title is great, but i don’t feel like it’s mine. Thanks for reading if you made it this far lol. While you’re here you should tell me what I should write this speech about.

Edit: Sorry, i’ve been busy and it was hard to keep up with this post. Thank you all for the kind messages! I really just wanted to get my feelings off my chest, but that’s hard to do with this topic without sounding like an ass. “Ugh, got valedictorian. Pity me” 🤦‍♀️.

I plan to study for a bachelor's degree at top universities in the EU, e.g., the Netherlands (UoA, Utrecht University, Erasmus University of Rotterdam...) or Denmark (Copenhagen Business School, Aarhus University...) 

I just don't know whether I should add an extra year of HS because I feel I will be behind my current classmates.... However, my family is supporting me to move to Denmark/Canada, and completing the IB or receiving OSSD will give me an advantage in admissions at unis since the Czech Maturita is not widely recognized internationally.

Last year (grade 9) I barely paid attention in class, never studied, and yet, I got straight A's. I was in the top 5 of my class and ended with a 94%. This year (grade 10) I just recently started my math class and am already at a 75%. Everyrhing we've been doing do far has just been a reveiw of last year and seemed easy. On my most recent test, I spent the week before studying for an hour before school, and around 40 minutes to an hour after school. Dispite this, I only got about 80%. That, mixed with my 50% and my (approximately) 60%, landed me a 75%. 

I usually love learning and spend a lot of my free time watching videos and doing research on topics that interest me. Recently, I've found myself not doing that anymore because I feel too stupid and not worthy of information. After typing it out, it sounds stupid, but that's what I'm constantly telling myself.

I take notes in class, do my homework and study for hours and it's not working.

I think I  need easier classes but idk maybe I’m just saying that cause I’m struggling, my parents would never just understand that maybe advanced and gifted just aren’t for me I feel like they just don’t understand. All I want to do is do track and play football next year but I can’t even do that cause my parents aren’t gonna let me. What am I gonna do if I fail 9th grade my parents will kill me and my GPA will be terrible holy sh*t everything feels so pointless. I don’t even feel depressed most of the time like when I’m at school and talking to friends and at track practice, I just don’t think about my grades but then I go home and am constantly in fear of that text from my parents that my phone is getting taken away or my mom calling me to her room to talk to me about my grades like I hate it so much. But then I just don’t do my work despite that. I’ve tried therapy and that stuff just doesn’t work for me. I just want to go to the gym with my football friends and go to track with my track friends and play football next year but soon I won’t even be able to do that cause of my parents and grades. Ik I sound extremely depressed and depressed probably but most of the time I don’t even feel sad or empty like I do at home sometimes and I don’t want to label myself as depressed. Idk I love my parents a lot but just don’t know it’s not like their bad parents or even that strict they just expect more from me than I feel like I can produce like idk and I’ve even told them that almost straight up but idk they kind just don’t understand ig.

323,Urgent Advice Needed,11eufsw,"So I’ve been struggling with finding motivation to do school and it’s gotten to a point where I’ve been skipping schools for weeks. I got back to going to school after the semester was over, but now I’m starting the same habit again during my second semester…it’s been a week since I haven’t gone back.
To give context, before the pandemic I was a pretty well rounded student, then I slowly started falling apart once the pandemic hit. I started missing a lot of work and it brought my GPA down a lot. Now that we’re back in person I’m doing a lot better but don’t see a point of doing school. I screwed up my GPA and attendance, and I’m completely unprepared for the SAT. I’m more than halfway through my junior year but honestly at this point idk what to do. 
Since I haven’t been doing any school work and I’m constantly absent, I’m extremely anxious to go back to school and face my teachers and classmates. I talked to my school counselor last semester but she didn’t seem to understand how I felt and basically told me to just do my work and get it over with.
Recently I’ve gotten back into a habit of self loathing, and I haven’t been properly taking care of myself. I constantly have horrible thoughts because of the fact I’m not doing well in school. At home, it feels like no one has much expectations of me anymore and gave up on me. I’m disappointed with myself because of the fact I know I have so much more potential but instead I’m putting myself down. It doesn’t help that I’m in a school where the expectations are high. I was an honors student before but now I’m someone who can barely stay above average and has no motivation or ambitions.

My mother said it was best if I stayed homeschooled and I don’t even know why I listened to her in the first place! I’m a teen (or at least I was a teen) and I’m supposed to be rebellious! I wish I could travel back in time and stop myself from being homeschooled! I’m so jealous of him!

351,I'm doing worst in my second semester after a mediocre first. semester,11d78hh,"So yeah I came in my second semester hoping to keep the good grades I got last calendar year as well as improving my less ideal grades but yeah that not working out and I'll just say why  and say every class basically


First is chemistry honors, last semester I pretty much got straight A's on every test and stuff and found it fun but in the second semester we started stoichimetoy and it completely wreck me, I'm starting to understand it a bit slowly but I'm just waiting to move on


Drawing 2.... Use to get B's mostly but now I haven't done anything cause of personal reasons and fears and I rather not talk about that in a public forum but yeah...


Spanish 1, use to get As now getting B's, alot of it is I'm just less interested in what we learning and I have an assignment or two I didn't do cause I didn't understand the instructions so yeah


World geography honors, the only class I have maintained my As in, not much else to say


English 1 honors, I struggle alot first semester and wss borderline failing for mothers second quarter, I somehow ended up with a 80 despite never turning in anything that good, now second semester I turn in some stuff but I didn't do the last assignment cause I couldn't think of how to start it so a week of nothing and that goes in as the lowest grade you can get  in the grade book, now we have to write an essay and the teacher said we have to write an introduction paragraph this weekend but idk what exactly we supposed to write and the teacher might of said but don't remember and the paper for the assignment gives no clues, the reason she wanted us to of it so we don't fail behind which is my biggest reason for not doing work so idk this essay probably another 1 in the grade book.


AP computer science principles, made a 72 first semester but now making mid 90s this semester, my biggest approvement but eh not impressive, last year our teacher left at the beginning of the year so we had to learn completely on our own and now our  curent teacher is my grades will remain good but I don't think I'm learning anything, I don't understand basic code despite being in this class for months and my grades are not affected cause our teacher doesn't work with code and instead of completely unrelated activities in which simply parpitioning is enough to get a 100.



Finally geometry honors, barley pass first semester and plan to study more but the second semester started with proofs and I absolutely despite them and went to a very low C and then we did another unit about circles in which I absolutely suck at and I had like a dentist appointment on a day we review alot so I didn't understand alot and bomb one test and was failing and then at the end of the unit we had a final test on circles and I didn't understand like most questions on the test st all but somehow I did decent and bounce up back to passing, now the next unit according to my teacher is short but so far I find it pretty easy so hopefully I can use this as a recovery unit


Yeah my goals went from approving to maintaining and my freshman year GPA is mediocre as hell, I already plan to watch a bunch of video s about my classes next year like over the summer so my sophomore year is hopefully better but just yeah idk",2007erTheSpudFan,1,2,0.75

I haven’t taken any AP’s yet, but I’m probably going to take APEL and Honors Pre-Calc my junior year. I’ve debated adding APUSH and I’m more likely not going to take it because I’m already somewhat busy with honors classes and I don’t want to end up regretting it later dropping the class if I don’t like it. From what juniors have told me at my school, APUSH has one of the most rigorous workloads and the teacher isn’t good nor bad. My school works on a trimester based system so considering my schedule and the elective courses I have to fulfill I can take up to 2 AP’s 1 honors max. APES (I plan on taking senior year maybe), and AP Physics are my other option but people tend to feel neutral towards course too.

I tell my Case manager/homeroom teacher and Counselor that I'm interested in DE and they're telling me the exact opposite like ""The workload is a lot since it is college"" and that ""It'd better if you could take like a honors or AP class first to prepare for it.""  
Just need a bit of clarity on your guys' experience, as although I'm prolly gonna go with my friends suggestions but ofc extra confirmation is always good.

My Dad hasn’t spoken to me since Friday night. I snuck out to a party in the city, but panicked and called my friend’s Mom, who picked me up but made me tell my dad in front of her. He nodded, shook hands with my friend Mom, and walked off. The next day, I got a long text from my Aunt saying she’s coming to get me Tuesday and I’ll live with her until graduation. I’m 18, my Dad has decided he no longer wants me. He told my aunt the reason is because I don’t want to be parented, so he’s done parenting. He says this because:

1. I yelled at him in public because he had my gf removed from a family gathering. We were all together for my Grandma’s 85th birthday. I asked to bring my GF, but my family doesn’t know I’m out. He said he didn’t care I was lesbian, but since my Grandma just got into remission and it was her birthday, this wasn’t the day to come out to the family. I brought her anyway, he told her to leave, my gf said she’d only leave if I said to, so my Dad called security.

2. My Dad grounded me for 1, so he took my phone. I went into his drawer and took it back(he is an admin at my school. He just told me that was drive two, then shut my phone off.

3. This was sneaking to the party.

My aunt is coming from 2 states away to get me and said my Dad has no intention of dealing with me once I’m picked up.

368,An Open Letter to Students,11btnv9,"Hello Students, 

Good heavens I sound like a teacher - which I am not. I (25M) think I earn the same as a teacher earns annually ($47k, Zippia.com). I actually earn just a little bit less by working a 9-5 job at a NY insurance company since late 2021. Last thing to mention is I saved a lot of that salary by living with my parents right after college (2019). 

So, money isn’t really a problem for me. 

Here’s the kicker: I barely got by with high school (from 2.5 to 3.5 GPA) and college (2.9 GPA). 

Another kicker: I was bullied for being in special-ed (that is until I did what my guidance counselor told me not to do what I wanted to do - that is by declassifying myself). 

Peers of mine use to call me a “window licker” after going into and leaving the short bus. 

I used that to motivate myself in school. Still use that memory to motivate myself to this day. 

I might need threapy. 

Anyways, enough about my background. 

This is about you. The majority of you anyways. This isn’t for those with great grades and 5 AP Class schedules. I’ll go back to this shortly. 

This is for the ones who are struggling. 

Struggling educationally, physically, emotionally, etc. 

Please understand kid, you aren’t the only one struggling. Millions before you and definitely after you will struggle. 

That is unless the department of education overhauls the entire education system and miraculously improves the NAEP’s National Report Card. Highly unlikely but hey…we have to hope for the best, right?

Listen kid: don’t beat yourself up for the things that are out of your control. The way the school system is set up is so archaic and, honestly, limiting that you feel like you can’t shine - especially when you put in your all and it doesn’t show. 

Standardized tests/ exams/ quizzes are pretty much hoops for each of you to pass thru - hopefully with flying colors. Some of you won’t make it each time. And guess what: that’s fine. 

What’s important to remember is to use that result to motivate yourself and to do better the next time around. I want to believe teachers and faculty care about a student’s educational progression/ direction - that is the “they where here and now they are there” mindset - and not that singular result. 

So if you get that 30,40,50 percent on a test. A failing grade right. It’s okay. What matters most is after that. Just make sure you get a 51 next time and or a much higher percentage you know. You want to end as strong as possible.

If you were a waiter/ waitress and you accidentally overfilled a customer’s glass with water, you not only apologize but you add “I always give 110% on the things I do.”

They won’t get(that) mad. 

Kid, you have to give it your all - to the end. 

As long as you finish, employers will reward you accordingly. I’m literally living proof. 

Remember I said I would come back to those who got good grades and had like 5 AP classes in their schedules?

Well,

As you focus on your own educational route, there is one major pothole you have to avoid. This is the hardest part: 

Don’t focus on others. Pay them no mind. 

Psychologists agree with the phrase “compare and despair.” People do this by putting up their lives against others and then getting upset when it doesn’t match up. 

I’m telling you, as someone who use to be in your shoes and did just that, it gets much worse later on. I did it earlier with money - didn’t I? Good heavens I still compare myself. 

I definitely need threapy. 

Take it day by day. The goal is to look back at your life and just smile. 

I’ll end it with this:

Life is not really this twisted exam where you enter this classroom (i.e., this world), you are given a pencil (your brain) and then told to take this exam. And, after you sit down and view your exam, you recognize that not only are there no answers to select but also there are no questions given. 

The test is blank. 

It’s blank canvas. 

And you have the pencil. 

I just hope you are proud of your canvas - the one that use to be blank. 

I’m half-way done with mine!

Here I come Psychology Today. 

Warmly,

369,Math difficulty differs for each high school,11bozk4,"As a student who attended 2 high schools last year, Honors Algebra was my easiest class at my first high school and then it became my hardest class at my second high school. The first high school gave us typed guided notes on google slides and gave us an easy review for quizzes/tests which were straightforward. While the second high gave us a huge algebra book every night with lots of complex questions and forced us to look through every single question in class notes to review for quizzes/tests.

Greenie cheats and gets keys for everything which is the only reason he's passing. Napoleon is known for never putting effort into anything.

They have not and I've already completed all the research and slideshow on my own. When we were in class, we had half the period to work on it (day it was assigned). I couldn't get their attention and they were looking up memes. During that time, I did all the needed research for the project and read all the documents and went over the information out loud. We are making the story and slides on Google docs and slides, so I know I could prove that they didn't help since it records that. The only thing they've done is make jokes about which part in the story should go to who and how to make it funny. We haven't even decided on how the story will go or started writing it.

I do find math really easy if I'm being honest, not trying to brag, I did try to request to go to a higher math level in middle school one time although they denied with my 6th grade math grade being there.

Less than 48 hours ago I posted this and it got much more attention than I anticipated, thank you all so much for the support and sorry I couldn't reply to all the comments and DMs, there were just so many. I posted an update edit on the post but I checked the post insights and the views have plummeted since I edited it and only 2 new comments. Then I've seen some people posting new posts and linking the old ones back instead so that the people who commented on the first one will see there's an update, new to Reddit here.

This is what I wrote:

UPDATE: Wow I am overwhelmed by all of the comments and DMs! I never expected the posts both here and on [r/smalldickproblems](https://www.reddit.com/r/smalldickproblems/) to get so much attention. Currently the posts have a combined 23.3K views, 129 comments, 26 shares and I have received 10 DMs. I'm sorry I won't be able to keep up with all of the comments and I'd like to say thanks to everyone for the support and advice but please settle down with the DMs, it's gonna take me a while to answer all of them.

On the situation, he didn't come to school yesterday(Monday) and as I'm writing this it's Tuesday morning(Australia). I am really struggling what to decide what to do because I've had such mixed advice, but I've had some other guys with small dicks DM me and most of them said to pass a note to him to talk later and explain that I though what happened to him was terrible and that I think he's great just the way he is. Then I'll ask him to go out for lunch with me on the weekend or after school. To the people telling me to take him in to bathroom and ""see how big it really get's"", sorry to let you down but that's not gonna happen, at least not yet. You're also right, I was being cowardly by not sticking up for him more and considering ignoring him because I was afraid how it would affect my social life, at the very least, I'm gonna make sure I'll be friends with him and if any of my friends aren't okay with that then they can fuck off.

As for the legal and administrative action, I'll wait until I've spoken to him and we'll see how it goes, I'll support him but I won't do anything behind his back because ultimately it's his choice how he wants to proceed. Hopefully he's at school today and if so I'll tell you how it went this arvo(remember the time difference). Thanks again everyone, I feel so empowered to make this right after feeling all the encouragement and humanity this initiated. Wish me luck.

UPDATE 2: Okay so I had English last period and was expecting to see him then and hand him the note but after I got out of Mum's car I saw him straight away ahead of me so I sped up to catch up to him. I said ""Hey"" when I reached him and he got startled because he was walking alone and I was catching my breath. He said hey back and he stopped to look me in the eye with nervous anticipation. I asked him if he wanted to come meet me down at the farm after school and he hesitantly said yes. I was strongly hoping no-one else would be there. I texted Mum during break and told her I was going to walk home with my friends.

I walked in to English and I waved at him(he was already seated when I walked in). After the lesson finished I was walking out and chatting with my friends and walked to the carpark expecting to see Mum there because I almost forgot but then suddenly remembered and started walking over to the farm. Poor guy must've thought I stood him up because I saw him standing there looking for me, but I waved at him and he stood there waiting for me to catch up. As we were walking I asked how his day was and he asked me how mine was. He said he was nervous to come but felt great after seeing me this morning. We weren't quite there but no-one was around so we stopped to begin talking.

I grabbed his hands and asked ""So how are you feeling since last week?"", he responded ""Oh well, I'm fine"" but I could tell he wasn't and he looked terrified of me. Now luckily I remembered somebody called ""u/johnlucas-selfimage"" on the post on smalldickproblems, advising me what to say: ""**Those people had NO RIGHT to do that to you. I am so sorry for what you went through. You do not deserve this. Nobody deserves this. I want to be your friend. I will support you through this. I will stand up for you. If you ever need someone to talk to or rely on, I'm here for you. I want to be your friend. I'm not going to hurt you like they did.**""(thank you for this comment). I didn't remember it word for word but I repeated it as accurately as I could. The poor thing looked down and stuttered so I held his face and said ""It's okay, you've got no reason to be ashamed, I think you've got a beautiful penis."" He looked up at me, his face trembled and a few tears came out of his eyes ""Really?"" he said. I nodded and he tried to hold his crying back, I hugged him and he still tried to hold it back. He said ""Thank you so much for this. I was horrified at the thought of coming back and I thought only my friends were gonna comfort me, I never thought a pretty girl like you would"". I said ""Aww that's okay"" and he said ""You promise you're not trying to set me up or anything?"" I assured him I wasn't and I hugged him again. I asked ""Do you wanna grab lunch with me on Saturday"" and he said yes. I gave him my phone number and we said goodbye, I winked at him as I walked away and he got all embarrassed which I thought was really cute.

It was about a 20 minute walk home and I explained the whole situation to Mum and Dad when I got home, they were shocked and commended me for the way I acted. I texted him later to ask if he knew what happened to the 3 people that pantsed him and he said the principle called his mother to explain to him what happened and that the 3 students got a 2 week suspension.

442,Has anyone gotten out of truancy for good grades?,118cxqc,"Don’t really know where to ask this, so if you have any recommendations of other places please let me know.

I’m a senior in high school who just recently got a letter in the mail for truancy. This makes sense—I am usually marked absent at least once a day, if not more (sometimes just because I’m super late, tho). However, I’m also a senior who has a 3.82 unweighted GPA who is only taking AP classes this year (AP gov, AP Lit, AP Calc BC, and AP Bio). It’s safe to say my poor attendance does not affect my ability to excel.

I skip a lot of school because attending school has actually made my grades drop in the past. When I regularly attend class, I feel incredibly drained for the rest of the day. When I’m drained, I struggle to do my homework or attend my extracurriculars (volunteering at the hospital and tutoring 2 other students). 

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and I suspect this is a symptom of my anxiety (however I don’t actually feel anxious while at school, so I’m not sure). My mom and I have considered asking for a 504 plan several times, but we’ve never decided to go through with asking for it since we didn’t feel that my ability to succeed was being heavily impacted by it.

Apparently, the district disagrees. We haven’t been fined yet (thank goodness) but we did receive the long letter in the mail which is basically one step before receiving a fine.

So, I’m asking anyone who sees this: can you get out of truancy as a senior with a high GPA/good grades (almost all As)? I want to continue taking these classes because I enjoy the subjects, so I don’t want to graduate early (plus I’d have to get an alternative diploma which would close many doors for me).

Attending class more often will likely not be a viable option, because I don’t want my grades or enjoyment of the subjects to be hindered by attending school more often. I know it sounds backwards but it’s just how I learn.

Edit: would it be worth pursuing a 504 plan for this?

Edit 2: I wasn’t very clear about my anxiety issues, so I will clarify. My anxiety has manifested itself primarily as performance anxiety, however it has popped up differently throughout my life. I don’t feel anxious just being at school, however I do feel incredibly anxious before school. The usual “school dread” is much more significant for me than it is for someone without anxiety.

When I say I feel drained, I don’t just mean I wanna relax and sit on my phone or something stupid like that. I mean after attending school, even for just an hour, I literally feel like I’m going to collapse and like I need to sleep for a million years. I often get somewhere between 6-8 hours of sleep every night, however even on nights where I get 10+ hours of sleep I still feel like collapsing after getting home from school. Oftentimes I will fall asleep. I will sleep for 6-8 hours at night (11pm to 7am usually) and then get home from school and sleep for another 5-6 hours.

This only happens with school. I had a job over the summer and was fine. I volunteer at the hospital and tutor other students, which does not affect me this way. It is *only* school. To be even more specific, it has only been elementary school, middle school, and high school. I also have college courses and they do not drain me. 

For those calling me “lazy but smart”… What do you spend your time doing? I’m taking 4 AP courses, self studying 3 more, taking a college course, volunteering at the hospital, tutoring 2 kids consistently, and tutoring others for drop-ins at a Writing Center. I’m by no means the most active or hardworking student out there but lazy?? I think that’s a stretch.

why is highschool so badly run compared to elementary school. 

in elementary we would have an hours recess every day to play kickball, soccer, basketball. basically whatever we wanted to play that day. 

all our classes were taught in the same room so no need to shuffle through the halls to different rooms. and when we did move classes the teacher would bring us in an orderly single file line. teacher was responsible for us arriving on time instead of being late. liability was all on the teacher. 

the same teacher taught each class so they were accountable for not putting all our tests on the same day. 

basically highschool was an all around sh*tty experience compared to elementary school.  the teachers had way more accountability and if things were not going well blame fell on the teachers. 

I feel like highschool teachers try to hide and place blame on the students

The bake sale could be held at school (I would have to ask guidance for permission, he didn't reject when I brought up the baking club), however I am worried about allergies and how it would work with my school schedule. At my school, lunch can be periods 1-5, so to get the most people to buy I would have to miss all of my classes to host this sale.
2. *Route 2:*  
Same fees and plan, however instead of selling at school, I could go door to door on the weekends. I don't have much to do on those days, but I am unsure if people would be open to buying cookies or if they would be upset I bothered them on the weekend.

**Considerations**

1. I am not a good baker. I think there would be a lot of screw-ups when baking with beginners at my school.
2. I don't know if people would buy the baked goods, especially considering how they might be malformed because we aren't expert bakers.
3. I don't know what a reasonable price is for a treat, ex. a cookie. I also don't know how much I would need to sell it for to be able to keep buying ingredients while also reaching X fundraiser goal.
4. There is a Food and Nutrition course at my school and they bake sometimes. I could ask the teacher there to be our sponsor and advisor. However, I haven't met her before so I'm not sure if she'd be willing to help.
5. I'm not sure how to account for how many people will buy and how many won't.
6. Baking is a big thing at our school. Many of my classmates took the aforementioned course and many are taking it this semester. If the club grows too big I'm not sure how I would manage that, so I put the entrance fee to deter some people. Then again, I'm not sure if that many people would even want to join!

**Reasons for starting this club**

1. I want to be more involved in school.
2. Good extracurricular.
3. I am a patient at SickKids and I want to give back.
4. I want to step out of my comfort zone and try something new.
5. I would like to do something special before Gr. 11 so that I can focus on my grades next year.

**Questions**

1. If I sell someone a treat without a nutrition/ingredients label and they have an allergic reaction, am I responsible? Should I just make a label or if it's at school should I make them sign their name on a form?
2. Would I be liable for any injuries? Should I send out a form first and get participants to sign it?
3. Should I get someone else to host this club with me? Should I just drop the idea?
4. If anyone else here has held a bake sale or club, what tips would you give me? For those who held a bake sale, what profits did you make and how successful/unsuccessful was it?",xaiyzu,9,3,1.0

466,"16(f) This guy at my school got his shorts pulled down and we all saw his penis, it was quite small. He got extremely embarrassed and looks mortified every time I see him. I feel so sorry for him and want to make him feel better. How do I do that?",1167lk6,"A month ago my family recently moved towns and I started going to the new local school. The new school seems a bit harsher and the people there are less friendly, there seems to be more bullying and more of a social hierarchy. Luckily even as a new kid I fitted in well quickly because I'm pretty and made friends with the relatively popular kids.

I had seen this boy around regularly and share my English class with him, he is geeky and seems very smart but he never looks happy. I knew he probably got bullied and people were often mean to him in the one class I share with him. He always seemed nervous to speak in front of the class and I noticed one of my friends was quite rude to him, but being the new girl I never really felt the courage to defend him. He is so shy that I barely even spoke with him but in any scrap of conversation we had I was always kind to him and always thought he was kinda cute.

2 days ago though, just as the break had started I was walking with my friends to our normal area. We were under the upstairs B block balcony which is usually the busiest route after breaks as some junior classes are held at A Block which is near the library where seniors usually are and the juniors usually hang out closer to the oval as that's where most of their classes are.

It was busy as usual and I saw that boy walking down the stairs about 20 meters ahead of me while some other boys were at the top yelling at him and laughing, then this one comes running down behind him just as he got to the bottom and slammed him in to the wall, about half of the people stopped to watch on while the others kept going. Then very quickly a few more came down including a girl, one of them grabbed him along with the other who already had a hold of him.

He started to struggle and try to escape but the 2 guys who were both bigger than him were holding him firmly, that's when the crowd started to quieten down and all surrounded him. I'm quite short so it was hard for me to see beyond the crowd but I walked around the side to try and get a closer look and a few seconds before I got there I heard the whole crowd gasp collectively. Then when I got there I saw exactly why.

His shorts and underwear were down to his ankles and the crowd of at least 100 students saw him exposed and yes, it was pretty small. The 2 guys were still holding him and pulled his shirt up and the girl had just walked back from closely behind him, clearly being the one who pulled them down. He had thrown his head back and I could see he was very distressed, he struggled really hard to get out but they wouldn't let him go. The girl then placed her thumb on his hip and shouted ""I think my thumb is bigger!"". The crowd roared in laughter and the most heart-breaking look came over his face.I pushed as close to the front as I could and shouted ""let him go"" but they just ignored me and then a teacher came racing over and started screaming at them. So they pushed him to the ground and the teacher yelled ""Everyone get away now!"". Everyone started to slowly leave and the poor guy burst in to tears. I looked back at him and we locked eyes for about a second but he then pulled his shorts up and ran away. I then just heard the teacher shouting at the 3 of them for as far as I was in earshot as my friends and I walked away.

Out of the 4 of them, only 1 expressed any sympathy for him and said something like ""That was so fucking mean, I can't believe they did that to him"". While the others just focused on how small it was. I've seen him around a few times and he just holds his head low looking mortified to even be there. At English class yesterday people were waving their pinkie at him as we entered and he put his face in his hands. I said hi to him as we were entering to try and be friendly but he just nodded and avoided me. He sat in his usual seat by the window silently, looking like he would rather be anywhere else.

I just feel so bad for him and despite what almost everyone else seems to think, there was no excuse for doing that to him. I just don't see how a guy having a small penis(which is obviously something he's going to be embarrassed about) justifies teasing him for it. Nor does someone being nerdy and awkward justify humiliating him like that at a place he has to attend 30 hours a week.

I thought you guys would have the best advice on how to to make him feel better, it's the weekend now and I imagine he will be spending a great deal of it crying in to his pillow wanting to die. What should I say to him? How do I comfort him? I wish I had said something earlier but I wasn't going to do it in front of everyone and the only way around it was to somehow approach him in public as those were the only times I saw him and ask to speak to him in private which just seemed too god-damn awkward to do and feared it would embarrass him further. Do you think he would maybe just want to forget about it as soon as possible and not want me to bring it up? I am pretty sure people will continue to bully him for it for a long time and I thought maybe if I could be the one to share some kind words to him, it would be of comfort and relief for him. Or am I wrong? I don't know. Any advice would be greatly appreciated to help me decide ultimately what to do. Thank you!

EDIT: Wow I am overwhelmed by all of the comments and DMs! I never expected the posts both here and on r/smalldickproblems to get so much attention. Currently the posts have a combined 23.3K views, 129 comments, 26 shares and I have received 10 DMs. I'm sorry I won't be able to keep up with all of the comments and I'd like to say thanks to everyone for the support and advice but please settle down with the DMs, it's gonna take me a while to answer all of them.

On the situation, he didn't come to school yesterday(Monday) and as I'm writing this it's Tuesday morning(Australia). I am really struggling what to decide what to do because I've had such mixed advice, but I've had some other guys with small dicks DM me and most of them said to pass a note to him to talk later and explain that I though what happened to him was terrible and that I think he's great just the way he is. Then I'll ask him to go out for lunch with me on the weekend or after school. To the people telling me to take him in to bathroom and ""see how big it really get's"", sorry to let you down but that's not gonna happen, at least not yet. You're also right, I was being cowardly by not sticking up for him more and considering ignoring him because I was afraid how it would affect my social life, at the very least, I'm gonna make sure I'll be friends with him and if any of my friends aren't okay with that then they can fuck off.

As for the legal and administrative action, I'll wait until I've spoken to him and we'll see how it goes, I'll support him but I won't do anything behind his back because ultimately it's his choice how he wants to proceed. Hopefully he's at school today and if so I'll tell you how it went this arvo(remember the time difference). Thanks again everyone, I feel so empowered to make this right after feeling all the encouragement and humanity this initiated. Wish me luck.",flavourlessjellybean,113,94,0.89

480,How do I survive second semester of senior year?,116msoh,"Hello, I'm a senior in High School and I am struggling academically and socially.

I have been involved in my schools music (choir) and theatre program for the past 3 years, and I loved it. But I have burned out of my interest in theatre in particular. I got a chorus role in my schools musical, and I really have disliked this years production. We perform in two weeks, and I really wanna call it quits. Rehearsals are long and unproductive, cast members and directors are complete bullies, and I am not having fun like I used to.

The bigger reason I am struggling, is that I have been a completely different person in high school than who I wanna be, and on top of that, I have realized that most of my choir / musical friends are incredibly mean and toxic, and have been leaving me out of events, hang outs, etc. for the past year and a half. I've never had a social life in HS, but I easily could've if I would've not have been left out of everything. These so called friends dump all of their drama to me, are chronic complainers, and are incredibly negative in general. I really can't be friends with these people anymore.

In regards to the ""completely different person"" thing, I have been pressured to only do musical theatre by my friend group. I have been really interested in visual art for the past couple of months and really want to explore that more, but I feel like it's too late.

493,I don't think I'll get enough hours for my school's NHS (National Honor Society) Chapter,115tt6w,"For background: If you don't know what NHS is I'll explain it in the most simple way possible...

National Honor Society is a special club that requires students to volunteer a certain number of hours. You have to have a clean slate and a high GPA to get in. I believe for my school it's a 3.5 unweighted at least. The teachers who host it have to follow certain rules that the organization puts in place. Some high schools probably don't offer it though.

This is my first year in National Honor Society, and while I love going out a helping people from volunteering I just don't think I'm going to make the required hours needed. I can easily get individual hours without a problem but club hours are what I really struggle to get.

For starters, there are so many people in the club. So it feels like your competing with everyone else to get a certain event. Our events feel few and far between too, so there are less opportunties. When one is posted, it's almost a race to see who can get on the sign up website first. (It doesn't really feel fair.) When I'm lucky enough to get the event sign up in time, it's usually something I can't make because I already have plans.

What's even more stressful is that every quarter there's a certain amount of hours you have to complete. If it's the end of the quarter and you miss a few, those double and just make things worse. It's like credit card debt!

The whole thing is just a mess. Even if I do make the hours needed it might be even harder next year for my junior year when I'll be much busier with an afterschool job and harder classes. But I feel like I'm stuck in it. I'm not in all AP classes (I'll probably only take 2 at most my entire high school years) so I feel like I'm at a disadvantage when it comes to looking good for colleges. NHS feels like it might be one of the only things going for me besides my A's.

Is anyone else on here in NHS and can relate to my experience? Were you able to make all your hours despite being in a large club?

495,I'm about to fail my math class. What do I do?,115nu6p,"I (14F) am a freshman taking Precalculus. I was a straight A student until I hit high school. Currently, all my other classes (Biology, English, AP Chinese, Latin) are in the A range––but my math grade is a lovely C minus.

I will say that I'm not the only person who's on the brink––the majority of my math class is hanging on for dear life. Our class recently took two tests and both of them had class averages of 60-70. This led our teacher to chide us for ""not using our brains"" and having the poorest performance he's seen in his seventeen years of teaching Precalc. 

When my mom found out about my math grade, she signed me up for an out-of-school math tutor. I also check in regularly with my parents about what and how I'm doing in math class. (They grew up in China, where math education is hardcore.) Thankfully, they're not the kind of parents who freak out about bad grades, but, quite frankly, I wouldn't blame them if they were. My math grade is *abysmal.*

I swear I study. I do all the homework. I meet with my tutor weekly. I watch Khan Academy videos when I don't understand. I take careful notes. I have realized that I have some destructive study habits (such as not checking my homework or reviewing old assessments) and I'm working on overcoming them, but it's a process. I used to ask for extra help from my math teacher, but after he lost his temper in front of the class, he unnerves me. I suppose I've got to suck it up at some point. I am making progress––as in, one test was a 60 and the subsequent one was a 79––which counts for something, but it doesn't feel like enough. I still feel stupid. I still feel hopeless.

I have no idea what to do. I can't believe I let myself fall this far. I literally feel my heart rate climb whenever I step into the math classroom. I can't move down to a lower level math class because it would mess with my schedule. So far, my game plan is to continue with tutoring, and at the end of the year, either go to Calc AB or take Precalculus again. I hope I can drag my grade up in the spring term; there's no saving it for winter.

I assume y’all know what a student council is or all least have an idea of what it is. Anyways, I am a member of the student parlement at my school with 9 other kids. We debate about stuff like school lunches, clubs, and gender tolerance. Sometimes kind of serious, other times not. And then we pressure the school into changing whatever the parlement voted on.

Getting to the point, one of the topics that has been discussed but not resolved in the schools safety drills. After the shooting in Texas last year, we decided that we needed to improve our safety drills.

Here are some viewpoints that the other kids have.

- Two kids say that a fake shooter should be hired in order to test the current drills capabilities and improve after the test.

- One kid said that the drills are fine as they are.

- Another kid said to ask the school to form stronger ties with the police station.

- Three kids said that more viewpoints should be collected from the student body.

- And the final three, including me, abstained from voting but everyone needs to vote in order for ‘proper calculations’.

I honestly don’t know what to do. I sort of agree with all of them but they all have their cons for me. The next parlement meeting is on Wednesday next week for the final vote and so I really really really wouldn’t mind other peoples opinions on the whole thing.

**I, however, have seen further potential in the Internet than that:**

- More online services exist, such as Brilliant, though that is premium.

- YouTube has other channels, like 3Blue1Brown, Action Lab, Stand-up Maths, Tom Scott, Veritasium, and Vsauce. MindYourDecisions encourages practicing the problems shown. The comments also tend to contain intelligent insight.

- Discord servers exist for academic disciplines, like the Mathematics server and the Science and Technology server.

- Reddit has plenty of subs that cover academic disciplines, like r/biology, r/chemistry, r/compsci, r/literature, r/math, and r/Physics. This can also include asksubs, like r/AskComputerScience, r/AskHistorians, r/AskPhysics, and r/askscience, and the learnsubs, like r/learnmachinelearning, r/learnmath, and r/learnspanish. The massive help sub r/explainlikeimfive can also work.

- Twitter can work well if you follow individuals or organizations dedicated to educational content; this also includes the corresponding Twitter accounts of the aforementioned educational services and YouTube channels. Following enthusiasts, experts, instructors, and PhDs in certain fields leads to more accurate information regarding said fields, and I do not doubt that, like YouTube, their posts will also attract intelligent comments.

- Even other social media has the potential, like [this TikTok channel](https://www.tiktok.com/@tutorzed?lang=en) and [this other TikTok channel](https://www.tiktok.com/@why_axis_), as well as the corresponding social media accounts of the educational services mentioned above. Again, I don't doubt that the comments are positively influenced by the audience they attract. And I don't doubt that at least some field enthusiasts, experts, instructors, and PhDs use social media to post educational content.

Correlation does not equal causation, but I am curious to see the results for the sake of this project! This survey is completely voluntary and you may think of yourself or someone you know well when answering questions. I write this due to the fact that sexting is text messages and/or sexual visual content, which texting is protected speech while the visual content is not (it is illegal and considered child pornography for those under the age of 18).

Here's info on my situation. I am a high school student whos courseload was changed towards the beginning of the year and was forced upon some courses that I did not intend to take.  I talked to assistant principals, but they wouldn't budge, claiming that my schedule was now set in stone. With no other options, I talked to my counselor, who allowed me to switch out of the program and choose an AP course load that reflected my STEM interests. However, my program coordinator stepped in and changed my schedule to bar me from my original path, arguing that I needed to take other courses that I was not interested in taking this year. The coordinator expressed feelings of betrayal and reprimanded me for my actions. She then proceeded to destroy my relationships with my counselor and administrators. She forced my principal's hand into rejecting my switch in an attempt to teach me a lesson, and subsequently destroyed all hope of ever establishing a relationship with any of the administration by labeling me as nothing more than an unruly child. I've been trying to fix my situation for the past three months, talking to each of my administrators, but unfortunately, all have been unable or unwilling to help. I've even set up a meeting between my parents and the school administration, which also got me nowhere. I can't help but remain anxious about my academic future, constantly worrying about if I can meet my academic goals because of my coordinator's influence. As a last resort, I want to set a transfer to go to a different school within my county. Any ideas?

Should I take grade 11 physics in August and grade 12 English in the following year?

Should I take grade 12 English in August and grade 11 physics in the following year?

Should I cancel the summer program and take both courses in July and August?

but the dorms are a hell. i have been feeling left out since i came here from day one. i tried talking to the dorm head but the b!tch turned me down. she literally said that i am ""not adjusting"" with others, when one of my roommates told me to ""to d!e"", constantly bullies me, keeps the light on all night, makes loud noises till 3am in the morning, cracks very vulgar jokes with my other roommate all day. both of them paired up against me and made my friendship with a very close friend shatter.

i am loosing sleep, the pills don't work anymore. i keep having panic attacks around people and i don't feel any appetite anymore. but i can't tell the dorm head anything since she's biased towards my roommates.

I am under the impression that world issues would be easier, but I am thinking I might not be so interested in it? 

 Although, my only course the uni would take is last semesters data management, where I had an 88. (I think they take both functions and calc for science based courses.) So I need higher than an 88 in either world issues or kin.

I have a dilemma. I currently attend a public high school and recently applied to a good private high school close by.  I was wondering what should I do if I get accepted into this private school? Should I go there? Or should I stay in my current public high school? My current public high school has a few clubs, few AP classes, and overall is an okay high school. They value school spirit and tradition instead of what other schools value (students achievements and other honors). But the biggest problem with school is the lack of clubs and competitions. Next year, I am aiming to do the most and try to compete in some competitions. I want to apply to Ivy league schools and major in biology, but I don't know if this decision matters as much. This private school has a lot of difficult classes and clubs and it also has a great soccer team. But this school is not as diverse as the one I am attending. All I want to do is would attending this private school change anything? Would it give me a better opportunity? I have not been accepted to this school and I don't think I will be accepted to this school, but I am only asking if this scenario should happen. 

Another thing I am not sure about is whether I should go do an internship or go to a summer camp at a private high school and do their college summer classes?

594,Highschool is literally the easiest but hardest year of my life!,110vuqp,"I'm freshmen. I think that should say alot about me. I'm currently in my second term. And I used to be this topper and prodigy student before. And also in the first term. But the second term came... I started dating. OK I'm not blaming my problems on the fact I started dating but... I mean come on it kinda makes sense. My boyfriend vapes and smokes and does all of that kinda stuff so I was influenced to also get into it and started smoking, vaping, drinking and so on. So like at first everything was fine, it was new, it was nice, cute, but then fights started happening. I constantly got distracted by them that I started falling back in studies. I already had family issues and my boyfriend didn't want me to talk to him about it and I also didn't have any friend I was comfortable telling either, and when my grades dropped I completely broke down. My escape from home and school became the streets. I'd tell my parents I'm off to walks and runs but I'd light up a cigarette or smth. One of my biggest fears is loosing my virginity so I never let that slip, which I'm very thankful for. My boyfriend isn't a complete jerk but he's just... weird! Sometimes he's acting all nice, sweet and caring but suddenly he's moody and gets mad and acts like I killed his cat! And on... Thursday, February 10th I think, I asked him if he liked a classmate of mine and he didn't want to answer it. He never responded but the answer was clear. He said he was embarrassed. I was so mad cuz then he said that he cared about us both which really pissed me off. But what pissed me off actually was that the same girl is someone I considered a friend! She knows I'm dating him yet she still openly has a crush on him. Also in the fast I've trusted her too much which ended in her telling everyone a secret of mine which made my family issues worse. I hated her for it but I decided to let it go. And now she's crushing on my boyfriend, I consider that crossing the line. My close friends who also know about our relationship tell me to break-up and honestly idk if I can do it cuz i really love him and it'd break me and make me go worse but they say it's better. Also my parents don't know about my relationship or anything, they think I'm still the nerdy prodigy they always knew. The school also doesn't know since dating is forbidden. It's literally Valentines tomorrow (it's 3:20 AM Monday February 13th for me) and I've no idea what's gonna happen. I'll have to see him at school tomorrow along with that girl. I really don't want to tho. Idk what's gonna happen but I'm afraid if I break-up with him this time I'll hit rock bottom and end up actually failing a class or smth. I've had multiple mental illnesses in the past and still suffer from some. I have depression, insomnia, anorexia and self-harming. I really don't wanna mess things up I just wish everything was just as before!! Also the ""easy"" part is that my lessons this year aren't hard and honestly super easy, past me would've had it really easy but current me is struggling even if all the classes are considered easy by everyone


Edit:- thanks to all of you in the comments, it makes me feel more confident knowing it's not just me who goes through smth like this and thanks for all the support. My boyfriend and I decided that we would break-up after valentines, and for one day we'll be just like friends and the next day we don't have to ever see each other ever again. It's like a parting gift I guess? And today I talked that friend of mine and explained to her my feelings and said my last words before dropping her. I actually opened up to my two best friends about alot of my problems and yes they jokingly bullied me at first (that's just how our friendship is) but then were really supportive and cheered me up and kept my mind off things. That's the best thing about them, they're better than any cigarette or vape or drug. I think I'll need time with that one. I'll have to eventually tell my parents and idk what's gonna happen.

618,How much should I charge to do mathworks?,10zxrey,"I have a friend (not a close friend) who is not good at math and he asked me for help solving some of his math and physics problems.

However, I had (and still have) many requests of this type and he told me that he would pay me if I did it just for him. That's fine with me because I really hate solving people's math problems, especially when they give me nothing in return, but I don't know **How much should I charge to do it just for him?**

I know it could be detrimental to him in the long run, but he's good at other kinds of things, like drawing and music, and he's not really interested in getting better at math, he just wants to pass the grade.

I want to be fair to him because he is a very kind person, but I am saving money to buy a video game and obviously I need money.",IAmBatman899,3,1,0.66
619,Bilingualism survey for Texas High School Students,10zrax6," 

Hello! I am an AP Research student at Tomball Memorial High School. AP research is a College Board-created class that allows students to design, plan, and conduct a year-long research-based investigation to address a student-created research topic. I am gathering information about the correlation between being an Asian bilingual or multilingual high school student and academic success. As a part of my research, I would love for you to spread the word about my questionnaire! It should only take two minutes to complete, and all information, including information about your personal identity, will remain confidential. I have two surveys: one for high school students in Texas who are fluent in an Asian-based language, and one for high school students in texas who are not fluent in an Asian-based language. I have attached both survey flyers below. Thank you so much for your time, and I hope you have an amazing day!

620,Will bad grades for a Freshman High School year effect my chances of getting into a good college?,10zuqvr,"So, last semester I did bad. I'm talking about a 2.8 GPA. Long story short, I remade my work and got most of my grades up for most classes. But for 2 classes they had the same teacher (who resigned and therefore couldn't change my or a few other of my classmate's grades) which SEVERLY lowered my first semester GPA, although the grades weren't Fs. And for another class which was in-general just bad. I had a bit of a low grade for Algbera 2 as well (a C) which is NOT good because I want to go down an engineering career, or something similar.

This semester I'm doing good for most classes but my Math class (...again) and that isn't too good. The semester has been on-going for over a month now so I definitely got a good chance of bringing my grades back up for this semester.

Due to my school being pretty small we don't have many AP classes in-school, and outside of school I'm fairly busy. And due to my school being as small as it is, I can't redo my previous semester's classes.

Next year I'm probably gonna take AP classes even if they don't offer them in-school and I have to do them online. I don't know if this is gonna help but it's probably gonna help my GPA up.

My concerns are:

Are these grades gonna effect my chances of getting into a good college?

How can I fix my grades from the first semester without having the ability to redo them from the school directly?

If I choose an engineering path, will I have a lower chance of being accepted into engineering programs because of my GPA? Or can future semesters help bring back the GPA?",wxld94,19,1,0.57

622,what classes should i take for ux/ui design? am i suited?,10zt40k,"i've always been artistically inclined, and i think i have a good eye for graphic design. i've considered ui design because of this. i dont have much experience working with ui design softwares, but i'm only a freshman in school right now. currently i am taking an art class as well and i do enjoy it a lot. 

i especially am thinking of ux/ui design because it can combine my design aspect with  a tech related field--and it makes for a higher salary than if i were to be specifically art focused.

i've tried out coding html on freecodecamp, so just the bare basics, and i can't say i enjoy it too too much. however, im willing to give it another shot.

currently, i am doing pretty well in all areas of my academics, and ive always been sort of an all-rounder when it comes to academics. i'm just not really sure where my interests lie, but i know for sure that i am more of an artistic person. i'm not that worried about college right now, but i am considering the ivies.

Focusing more on Junior year,10zgl79,"Educational aspect : Here, when you're a freshman, You don't get to choose what you're studying - You study Physics, chem, biology, maths, history, geography, pol science, English same for sophomore year. In your junior year you get to choose between Maths and biology but Physics and chemistry are mandatory. Are American high schools any different? I've heard American juniors get to study a lot of interesting subjects in their junior year such as psychology and stuff. Is it true?

Social aspect : schools here suck - People don't talk to anyone, besides their best friends. Bullies, racists everywhere and junkies. The nerds are approachable but they are boring AF. From what i saw on Max resinger's vlogs American schooks seem to be the PERFECT schools. Everyone is very friendly, social, and they seem to help the shy peeps a lot.

625,My history teacher would rather let the room become a biohazard than let me leave during a test.,10yxrba,"Blood tw if anyone needs it.

This is completely insane and I wish it was fake. I know this was incredibly stupid and petty of me, but I'm sick of my history teacher.

I'm anemic, and I get pretty severe nosebleeds, especially in the winter when the weather's cold and dry. No, cauterization hasn't worked. I get nosebleeds a couple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day. My teachers know about this, and by now i dont even have to ask to go to the nurse, I can just get a tissue and leave the room and they know. I've never faked a nosebleed to get out of a test, as I know getting caught faking once would ruin my teachers trust in me forever.

My history teacher is kind of an annoying hardass and acts like it's a personal offense to leave his class. Some kid has to leave early for a doctor appointment? He acts like they've just insulted his mother. It's kind of weird. I've gone to the nurse a few times and he's always let me go.

My school has recently had some pretty crazy cheating rings revealed among the juniors (I'm a junior) so the teachers are all kind of on edge, which I understand. 

I had a unit history test today, sneezed really hard, blew a blood vessel, felt the telltale feeling, and got a tissue and asked to leave, because i didn't want just to leave without asking during a test. My teacher asked where i was going, and told me to sit back down and finish my test, since no one was allowed to leave the room. I was totally appalled, since this had never happened to me before. I figured it wasn't worth fighting so i grabbed the tissue box to finish my test.

Nope. Not allowed apparently. He told me to put the box back, since i already had a tissue. He probably thought someone wrote on the tissue box to cheat? What the actual hell.

I was so sick of my history teacher being a dick for various other reasons to other students, and i figured if he wasn't going to let me take care of the literal biohazard, I was going to make him regret it.

If you have frequent nosebleeds, you know that one tissue is never enough, even for light ones that last a minute or two, and this was a GUSHER.

Because of the cheating, part of the new system, at least in my history class, was to move half the kids to the library with another teacher and half the kids (including me) would stay to make more space. Since there were only 10 kids in the room now, we were all pretty far apart, and i was sitting in the back. Turning to look around the room was forbidden and would be assumed as cheating, so this is why no one noticed what happened.

I went through the one tissue in about 30 seconds. Since i couldn't go get more, I kept bleeding, and blood got all over my test. I mean everywhere. It went through the paper and soaked everything. I eventually just gave up on holding the tissue and my test started to look more red than white. My bright yellow sweater front turned red. I looked like I got in a fight and broke my nose. I looked like I was a zombie for Halloween. I'm used to blood, so i wasn't freaking out, I was just really, really angry. I finished my test and turned it in, and my teacher finally looked up from his computer, noticed me, and was really taken aback.

Mr. S: What the hell happened to you?

Me: I went through the tissue. Can I go to the nurse?

Mr. S: Go. Just go.

Me, dragging this out as long as possible, dripping blood on the fucking floor: Do i need to make a pass? 

Mr. S: GET OUT NOW.

So i left. The nurse, who I'm friends with since I'm there so often, asked what happened, i told her. She just sighed and said she would talk to someone, and told me that if a teacher wouldn't let me leave to just ignore them. Since I wasn't pinching my nose to stop the blood, I lost a lot more than usual and had to stay with the nurse for longer because i felt faint.

I know what I did was wrong, and extremely mean and petty, but i really think my goddamn history teacher needed to be taken down a peg. But now my yellow sweater is fucking covered in blood and I couldn't wear it for the rest of the day and I wasn't binding that day and I felt terrible since I couldn't hide it. Fuck this fucking place.",chillcatcryptid,7,32,0.93
626,Course Selection in high school is too hard,10zg6hz,"I know its long, but it really helps to have advice. 

Hi, to bullet point my situation. 

* Freshman year:
   * Have completed Chinese 1, but will be taking AP Japanese (my native language), which will fulfill my language requirements.
   * All honors and accelerated math + AP Human Geography
   * Extracurriculars: Track, Orchestra
   * Currently a freshman, honestly feels barely harder than middle school.
* Now for course selection
   * Thinking of taking AP Lang, AP World, Honors Chemistry, orchestra, and accelerated math 3(incorporates pre-calc as well), which will all be 5 GPA classes. I also do not need to study for math as I find it very easy.
   * As for extracurriculars: Orchestra is a must and also as the number of classes you can take does not change even if you take athletics, will be taking track. (just longer school time) 
      * I also wish to join teams of either science olympiad or robotics.
   * THE PROBLEM: As I will be taking AP Japanese, Chinese will only give me elective points, and have nothing to do with the requirements.
   * **Is it doable to take AP Lang, AP World, H Chem, Accelerated math 3, Chinese 2, Orchestra, Track, and an academics team sophomore year? I think extracurriculars would take an estimated 3-4 hours a day, with school ending at around 2:30. With some rest and eating, with 2 hours of studying a day(which I think is good enough), it would be barely fine to be able to finish everything at around 11.** ***Am I being too optimistic with my work ethic and time I would be able to finish all the work in?***
* Extra Stuff:
   * Junior Year:
      * I think thinking this far ahead is a bit unrealistic, but...
      * I want to take AP Calc BC, H Literature, AP Physics, APUSH, and a second science class (probably AP Chem or a harder AP Physics course), plus orchestra. This would make me even busier. I feel like this is unrealistic if I keep doing track and orchestra. **Is it better to prioritize extracurriculars or harder classes?**",pokosure,2,0,0.5

I wouldn’t consider myself a lazy student, I really do try, but I have some concentration issues. I might study for maybe 30 minutes and decide to take a break, only for the break to be longer than my actual study session. I also have begun to do more extracurriculars because I didn’t really have that many in my freshman year of highschool. I have almost no missing assignments, aside from two which is because my teacher didn’t accept late work and I forgot to contact them while I was absent. I’m only taking honors classes at the moment which doesn’t boost my GPA sadly and the only options for AP’s for sophmores at my school were AP World and AP Art History. I’m not really a history person so I only went with Honors World. I’m thinking of what classes to sign up for next year (sign ups are due in about a month) to boost my GPA a bit so I have higher chance of getting into colleges, but I’m not sure how motivated I’ll be by then to actually put in more effort. 

Turning in assignments, getting work done is not a problem for me. Studying for exams however can be difficult and I’m not sure if it’s because I’m used to cramming things in one or two nights and usually that’s worked out fine for me. But I’m also not really motivated to do the work at much as I used to. Still, I kind of gave up on trying to get my grades perfect when I only have 1 week left and then finals to turn things around.

My US Gov teacher is constantly giving us assignments which I believe are meant to be relatable to our generation. Last week he gave us an assignment where we had to make a ""TikTok style video that briefly goes over the influence on US government from historical English political documents and colonial governments"". I'm usually fine with out of the box types of assignments, but what bothered me is that he couldn't give us an example video or at least a rubric of what he expects. Then when I thought it was over, this week he gives us an assignment where we have to make a ""meme or social media post about one or more of the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation"" (no guide or rubric for this one either).

I don't have social media ( I created this account, just cuz I wanted to talk about this somewhere, I'm probably gonna delete this soon anyway), so maybe that's why I don't really understand what I'm supposed to do. But these attempts just feel like a failed attempt at trying to connect with a younger generation through something ""fun"" and ""relatable"" like memes and TikTok. Honestly, I'd much rather have a test or even write a paragraph length response than do this. I don't really feel like I'm learning anything. It honestly just feels like a waste of time compared to my other homework. 

I feel like it should be mentioned that this teacher also gave us a semester long project where we have to write a policy proposal about some contemporary government issue. This is supposed to be a well researched article with multiple sources. On it's own this is a reasonable assignment, however, we're expected to do this for homework. I just wish that rather than those social media assignments he would give us class time to work on this instead. We are only half-way into the quarter and this is already the most stressful class I have (for context this is an honors class, of my other classes 4 are AP and one is honors).

Overall, I just wanted to know if other people have a similar experience to a teacher like this, and what they feel about assignments like these.",CharacterRaise5790,0,1,0.6

Am I doing this right? Usually I'm good at physics, but this exam is stumping me. Are there any other resources with practice problems that you all would recommend? To clarify I know like 90% of the equations and concepts on the F=ma, just I'm still learning how to practice them.

There's this cute quiet girl who sits next to me in a class which I have a crush on, I'm not much of a talker myself but I'm not scared to talk to people to get to know them better but she's different. I have never talked to her besides for business purposes ( such as asking which question we were supposed to work on and when we bought fundraising sweets from each other, she in fact trusted me to give her the money the next day when I didn't have any with me, is this a sign or me just overreacting?) Once she bought a fundraising sweet from me for a class she smiled at me, and I noticed she had braces just like me, which was the moment a light sparked inside of me, I smiled back at her so she can see I had braces too. Anyways I want to know how to talk to her, I tried to build up the guts to at least say hi to her before she sits down but my heart was beating like crazy and my confidence keeps goin up and down.
She seems smart, and sometimes I do stuff in class which I would never do in my life, like saying the correct answer when nobody speaks up, just a way to try and impress her I guess. Plus i'm a senior and i'm not sure it she's a junior or senior, but would it be weird if a senior was dating a junior? Thanks to anyone one who genuinely helps",Big-Carpet4514,20,27,0.97

668,why i quit my wrestling team. the highschool chronicle...,10xk4vi,"i was never excelling at sports. in fact, i guess i could say i wasn't really good at them to begin with, even playing little league as a wee lad. while my peers were hitting home runs, i was zoning out in the field somewhere.. picking away at the grass. then there was basketball, and i also wasn't great at that, but by the end i actually started to improve. i really didn't like neither. my parents just kinda made me do it but but eh, atleast i experienced it. after a while they let me stop with sports for a bit and let me do my own thing which was, at the time, playing videogames. then my freshman year at highschool rolls by..

come november 2019. my freshman year. i'm ready to make a change. i had always wanted to become a wrestler of sorts. i actually started taking mma classes for a short bit. i became obsessed with mma.. but this all happened so fast. i was still kind of an unathletic kid and i'd spent years without sports up until now. so you can imagine what my first practice was like. i couldn't feel my entire body the day after while everyone else pretty much just.. whizzed by. cause they've been doing it for years, and me, i was just a beginner.

but i tread on. attended every practice. even when i was injured. during the matches, i never did so good. i never won very many. i stayed on jv for a long time and the only time i got varsity was when i was the only 180 lb kid on the team that they just threw onto the line-up cause they needed someone, anyone. and all throughout these two years of wrestling, i still didn't really know what i was doing. shit i didn't even know a lot of the rules. but yeah, i trucked through all of that until the end of my sophomore year. i found it extremely difficult to stay motivated. especially since i dealt with a lot of bullshit from my teammates. tough love will make you stronger for sure, but a lot of times i felt like i was being targeted and it made me feel like total shit. i never stood for it but often times when i stood up for myself, they just shook their heads at me. losing interest, then eventually starting to hate what was once my passion, i started thinking about it.. what if i quit? so, junior year eventually rolls by and my thought process is different, like, im thinking, i'm not going really anywhere with this anyway. maybe i should start anew.

oh yeah and i forgot to mention, one of my (much) older cousins were one of the coaches there. so by quitting, obviously that upset them.. including part of my family who had had a history of wrestling. 

anyway i found something even better to do with my time since losing all of those matches got fucking OLD, and it was working. i honestly feel like i should've been doing this from the start. so once the season started getting closer and closer i had to break the bad news, and my cousin just so happens to be the head coach so it was him who i had to tell. and he was trying to convince me otherwise, telling me i could add wrestling and working a part-time job into my schedule, but i genuinely didn't want that. afterward, he felt like he had somewhat failed to coach me properly and i still feel a bit bad for that to this day. but the one thing that's gonna stick with me forever is one of the other coaches asking me ' Are you proud of yourself? '

and to be honest, i kind of was! i was starting my first job. i was finally gonna have money, and time to experience so many more things. i mean shit, i've had my ups and downs, but i can say it's just been better overall since once i quit, i felt free. to this day my family still isn't the happiest with my decision, but i know i am and thats what matters. i'm eighteen now and i still receive a bit of grief for it. what matters is my parents supported me in it, i'm glad to have supportive parents like that because i know a lot who would shut their kid down for it. like i said, i'm glad i made this decision, i mean, i got my first job out of it. i'm able to maintain an amazing relationship with this girl that i've been with for three months and a half now. she's the light of my life right now.

 i quit that job not long ago and since then money has been tight for me and i was on and off with jobs for a couple months, however i recently got hired at again and i'm working at a bar now. it's much more fast-paced and relatively better than any other job i've worked.

so, in conclusion, majority of my high school experience was pretty shit in general but it actually got better once i quit sports. i'm just happy i had the confidence to not follow the crowd and do my own thing, because in the long run that ended up being the much, MUCH better choice for me... i just can't wait until hell (high school) is over so i can move onto trade school.

I am gathering information about the correlation between being an Asian bilingual or multilingual high school student and academic success. As a part of my research, I would love for you to spread the word about my questionnaire! It should only take two minutes to complete, and all information, including information about your personal identity, will remain confidential. I have two surveys: one for high school students in Texas who are fluent in an Asian-based language, and one for high school students in texas who are not fluent in an Asian-based language. I have attached both survey flyers below. Thank you so much for your time, and I hope you have an amazing day!

689,I find my friend really annoying,10vyyw5,"I have a friend who I've been friends with since birth since she's like a family friend. Lately I've been finding her really annoying because she always shit talks everyone, complains about everything, acts pretty bratty and spoiled (I don't know if this is as a joke but either way it's pretty annoying) and she treats her parents like crap and doesn't have any respect for them. She also hangs out with people who are just blatantly mean and judges everyone (which she kind've does too) and just calls everyone emo when they do anything she doesn't like or acts a bit emotional. I don't know if I'm the one being mean or too judgy cause I feel kinda bad for feeling this way. I haven't said any of this to her but I had to get it off my chest.

698,How to handle this student athlete?,10vrkvy,"We had a conversation about her potential and attitude. I see her as being really talented, but she’s not getting D1 offers because her grades suck, she doesn’t try on defense, she cherry picks, and doesn’t try to get rebounds. I also hate how she pads her stats when we are blowing teams out. I was telling her to fix her focus, but she came back at me. Here are a list of hurtful things she said:

- She mentioned how my twin sister, one of the best girls in school history(I’m coaching at our Alma matter) was the better athlete and how I’m in her shadow, as well as my younger brother who plays pro ball.

- She spoke about how’s she’s a sophomore putting up better stats than I ever did and how I was never as good as she is or will be

- She threw it in my face that my wife is leaving me(idk how she knew that)

My mentor who helps coach said I need to run her half to death, but not suspend her. He said suspending her gives her power and makes it seem like she’s won. He said I need to run her and push her, since laziness needs to be handled with stiff boundaries and a high bar, not me putting her in timeout for being mean. Thoughts?",hhg79,2,2,1.0

I cant even think straight right now so I run off and post incoherent nonsense on reddit instead of study. Why is everything so hard? Why is just working a little on the weekend hard? Why does every little thing feel like its beating me down?

How do yall work on the weekend when you're so numb you can't even feel the pencil in your hand?

How do you confide in your therapist when you know theres nothing they can do to make you feel something?

How do you deal with the fact that you're never gonna be fucking happy, not even just okay. 
That you've already thrown away your shot at a full tuition scholarship because youre too stupid to pull your grades up. That you probably can't even get into college anymore because youve screwed up so much.

700,I wasn't a great high school and still got a full ride at a Top 30 Univ,10vfhvk,"I regretted that I hadn't been a more involved high school student. I wasn't top 10% and had no real extracurricular.

If you're freaking out because (like me) you realized super late how college admissions work, starting at a cheap community college can “wipe your slate” clean. I became a super competitive community college student and still got over $200,000 in scholarships and into [Yale](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/yale-university/566) for my masters!

Despite being a CC transfer student, I was still able to base my entire college strategy on getting into the universities that offer financial aid guarantees promises for your family’s income level (“full need met schools”. As long I got in sometime, I could graduate with a guaranteed mostly full ride.

Because of these promises, I knew my local university (University of Texas at El Paso, $8,000 a year) was more expensive than the $54,000+ universities that offer financial aid guarantees. Crazy that the top schools that charge $50,000+ a year have money to give students full scholarships - and those scholarships include dorm, daily meals, and study abroad – making them a better deal for me.

**I was super motivated because these financial aid promises shifted my mindset**. I started thinking about my grades as guarantees for scholarship money. If I landed 5 As every semester for 3 semesters, I get the automatic scholarships. Every A, then, was like $10,000.

I drew up a plan to establish myself as competitive student in the four semesters before applying to top universities. Honestly, these 2-4 semesters could be your senior year + your 1st year at a community college/university, your 1st two years of community college/university, or your even last 2 years of high school.

The strategy I used: 1. Look for power vacuums or empty leadership positions to fill in school clubs or organizations like the student senate or debate club. Aim to hold two or three leadership positions. 2. Get great grades by doing school work daily (even weekends), and using Evernote/Anki flashcards for lecture and reading notes, use text-to-speech apps to turn your reading into audiobooks, and stuff like avoiding professors who give <10% of students As and turning in essays early for feedback, etc. Shift your mindset and pretend every A = $10,000. 3. Find unique volunteering in your community such as teaching ESL at churches, free tax preparation assistance for low-to-moderate income families, tutoring youths, or anything that uses your specific skills.

By doing this for three college semesters, I got into multiple $50,000+ schools with automatic full or nearly full scholarships.

I think others can copy this strategy too of transferring to a Top 25 to save money, though the financial aid guarantees only happen if their family makes under $70,000 a year, the median family income in the U.S.

Also, these top schools aren’t just the Ivy League schools. It also includes Oberlin College, Smiths College, UChicago, Occidental College where Obama went, the gorgeous University of Richmond where I went, Wesleyan University, George Washington Univ in Washington, DC, etc. These non-Ivy League schools have acceptance rates between 15-50%, much easier than the Harvard/Yale’s 4-6%.",catcatdogdog4,0,7,0.82
701,I Need Advice on Prom,10vnb13,"Okay so prom is coming up and I'm single. Most of my friends are coupled up, and those who aren't are pairing with another friend. I don't really feel comfortable talking or dancing unless I am doing it with my friends and I can't handle third wheeling. HOCO this year was just me wandering aimlessly and crying about being lonely then eventually joining in to dance for a bit. Nothing can compare to HOCO of '21 and I don't want to waste money if I won't have fun.

On the other hand, I have a really nice dress that I can't necessarily dance in but is really pretty. If I can't feel good enough to dance might as well take that one opportunity to wear this dress.

703,My principal told me I should leave the program I'm in because I won't be attending the field trip,10vsmd1,"So this Thursday I'll be having a field trip with a program I'm in to improve the school, I will not identify the place of the trip but I will say it's at a huge coorperation. The program I'm in gives me an opportunity to apply for a scholarship as well as a course credit, but I could also apply to that scholarship without the use that program.

I emailed the coordinators of the program that I will not be coming due to my physics quiz being on that same Friday and having my student council meeting at 3:15pm. My principal emailed me the weekend before the trip and asked me to see her in her office - mind you I had no context what so ever about what she wanted to see me about because of how vague her email was, so I freaked out about why she wanted to see me.

I went to her office at lunch and she asked me why I couldn't attend the field trip, I explained to her the situation with my physics class and how if it were a half day - which is when the program would take half my classes for that day - it'd be easier for me because I could talk to my teachers about what I missed. That day is also a course fair where students can see and apply for what courses will be available for next school year and I wanted to apply for ap chem and physics and possibly ap calculus. She did say she'd inform my teachers to accommodate me, but I also feel reluctant about that because physics is such a heavy course, my teacher would be lucky to even be able to cover 4 units within a semester - yes this is something he's complained about. She continues on and says that if I were to miss one day, who is to say that I won't miss another day, and says if I decide not to show up for this field trip that I should consider leaving the program.

I told my partner, friend and parents about the situation. My partner, who's attending my physics class, thinks she overreacted and that if it's necessary to go on that trip then he'll take notes for me. My friend, who's part of the student council and wants me to become prez, told me to go on the trip to get on my principal's good side. My parents believe that I should discuss this with my physics teacher and ask him what he thinks, depending on his answer I would decide whether or not to go on the trip.",mymypotato321,1,1,0.6

705,What is your School Security like at your high school?,10vrf9o,"Things changed a lot at the high school I go to after Uvalde happened. I’ve always been curious but redditors what is your school security like for you? For me they introduced two new things: 1:ID Badges and 2:(I think) 4 security guards.
The reason they introduced ID badges for us is because some kids who I go to high school with look like fully grown adults with beards, mustaches(etc), and so the security guards would always mistake them for adults or people who weren’t supposed to be on campus and also the second reason for the badges is because over 2200 kids go to the high school and the number is continuing to grow.
The ID badges can be used to check out a book in the library, paying for your lunch, or used for identification. They also had the suicidal number hotline on the back of them.
Things you could not do with the ID badges(you could change the lanyard though)1:we couldn’t have anything on the badge that includes stickers, writing, or anything covering your face. We also had a colorful border around our picture to indicate if we were a senior, junior(etc).
2:The reason for the guards was because they could constantly keep watch over the students, faculty and guests. 
There was also this one guard who had the job of making sure every classroom door was locked from the outside. Every time a new class period started and the bell rang he would go walking around the school making sure every classroom door was locked from outside. If it wasn’t he would pop in and say hey please close your door and make sure it’s locked. The other 3 would patrol the hallways.",ILikeRibs970,3,1,1.0

707,Generally what happens between prom and graduation?,10vljgw,"Ok so for context, I am a high school senior graduating in about 5 months. We’ve already gotten a confirmation on the dates for both the prom and the graduation. The prom is on June 3rd and graduation is June 7th. From what I’ve seen, many schools have their prom pretty early into May so they can take their finals afterwards and then graduate. My school does finals first, and also we’re one of those schools where the seniors start summer early so in general our finals take place around May and then the Prom and Graduation happen pretty close to each other in the first week of June. I guess it depends on the school but once you have all your finals cleared out, Is there really a point in attending school once Prom is over? I mean you have all your credits, your final grades are in, you have college or military enlistment secured by now, and you’ve gotten past the prom. Now all that’s left is for you to show up at the graduation and get your diploma. So what even is the point of showing up to school in those few days? Like when I was a junior, I took a few classes with some seniors and on the last week after prom before their graduation, none of them showed up to school. Pretty sure their graduation took place on a Saturday, so the last time I technically saw them in person was the week before prom. Idk, I’m on my last semester where grades for college applications technically don’t even count so the senioritis has been hitting me pretty hard. I’m working hard enough to get good grades cause I still need to pass my credits to graduate but its not like I’m gonna loose my head just cause theres a C amongst the A’s and B’s like I did with the previous semesters.

For reference, the other classes I plan on taking will be Honors Spanish, Honors Precalculus, AP Lang, and Orchestra. I don't want to overload my schedule with a bunch of difficult classes, so I thought I'd ask. 

For science (picking one)

AP Biology - I hated honors bio

AP Computer Science Principles - I hate computer science

AP Chemistry - I love honors chem, it's pretty easy for me. However our school apparently doesn't go over one of the necessary units for this course, so I won't do good on the AP test. And I hate not doing good. 

AP Physics C - Heard it's super hard. Hated honors physical science (if there's any similarity)

AP Environmental Science - I definitely want to take this class because it's so easy, but I want to save it for my senior year so I don't have to try hard

For Social Studies (picking two!) 

AP US History - First time it's being offered at my school, so no previous knowledge of its difficulty. My favorite teacher ever (like I actually love her she's amazing) is teaching it. I am interested in taking it

AP World History - Really want to take this class. Two possible teachers teach this one, one of which is the APUSH teacher I love so much. I think I'd be disappointed if I got my schedule and I didn't get her as my teacher. 

AP European History - I want to take this. Heard it's hard though. 

IB World Religions - I want to take this. Plus, a great teacher teaches this, and he's retiring after next year. I don't want to risk not taking it next year, and then be stuck having an awful teacher for it my senior year.

Bit of background, I’m autistic, in my last year at a small school (~50 people in the year now), and I’ve got no friends. I had some, but they’re really toxic (group A). after moving on from them, i started hanging out with group B, until i rejected a guy in the group and he spread a rumour that i said something sexual about my other friend, and they told all my friends. So i went back to group A.

Group A doesn’t like me because I did really well in this was assignment and they don’t think I deserved it.

719,How to Throw a Decent Graduation Party?,10unb4q,"I'm going to graduate from high school in a few months, and I just realized grad parties are a thing I need to be planning right now. I'm a first generation kid, and my parents are from a different culture where graduation isn't as heavily celebrated. Therefore though they have the means to pay for it, they have no idea and most of the planning will probably fall to me. First of all, I'm considering not having one. I'm an extremely socially anxious person who hates these kinds of events; I'm thinking by the grad party my social battery will be dead. I don't have that many friends, so aside from the few I have and a few teachers, the party will probably mostly be made up of my dad's work friends (we don't have that much family in this country so no extended family really), which makes it even worse. Second of all, with my parents already paying for college and goodness knows what else I need this year, I'm not too keen on spending a whole lot of money on one day. But I kind of have to have one; I come from a pretty small school, so everyone will know if I don't throw one. But I digress. So assuming I will be having one, what are the essentials I need for a grad party? And any ways to bring the cost down a bit (I'm considering designing and printing my own grad cards, but I don't want them to look stupid)?",purplepastelpangolin,11,5,1.0

I need to get a 100 average second semester for math(to qualify for a special program) and a 100 average in chem (so i don't ruin my gpa......)  
anyway, does *anyone* have a way to fix this?? literally anyone pls .  i have a tendency to waste time, i'm working on it  so that would be a great thing too  and also like motivation to do stuff lololol

its just

idek what to do anymore

bc ik i can be better in every single class- i just never put in the effort to do it

it's just so frustrating   
like people consider a 93 a good grade, don't get me wrong, but its not good enough because i KNOW my best is easily an A+ or better  
and i can get it.  
it's just that I'm not.  
perfectionism combined with disappointment and the fact that i know my best is far far better than this  


  
also- this is all combined with fear. I'm a first gen college applicant (from south Asia, parents know nothing, so i have to figure this out on my own). like, if i get a 85-89 average in chem this year, I'm kinda screwed, am I not??

So, some backstory.
In my 6th hour, I sit next to my friend and his two other friends who are girls, and the other day one of them asked for my snap, and when I handed her my phone my friend said ""She likes you"" as a joke. 
The next day, we were talking (My friend, her and me) and I said one of her teachers were boring to me and she said 'I don't think we can be friends anymore' as a joke.

Now, I'm the type of person that thinks if a girl talks to me she doesn't like me, just wants to be my friend, but my friend is making me feel like she likes me, which is making me feeling like I have to do something. 
But sometimes when I snap her like just now she doesn't answer them and leaves me on open, which makes me think that she doesn't like me, and just wants to be friends.

766,I absolutely hate grouped projects,10rsd9x,"Usually id just start my grouped projects early most of the time, but this time, I had so much work that I literally had 0 time to focus on it. I wanted to start, but I just couldnt because of my huge workload for other subjects. Im doing 8 subjects right now.

I was hoping at least 1 guy would type in the group, but no. No one said a thing. On the night before the presentation, I said in the group chat that we had to start this now, and if anyone can give any info whatsoever. No response for the entire night. Idk if they were sleeping or something, but no one gave a single response. The group chat was empty, so I decided to just start it. I worked my ass off and slept at like 4am, barely got sleep, and now when i begged them to start this morning, 1 guy sent like 3 sentences and thats it. I asked him to send more and he just wont budge.

Its so unfair man. I work my ass off, sacrificing my time and sleep, and stressing over my work, while they can just have things easy..? Just why? My mom even started to get concerned because of the late hours ive been staying up. I hate this man. Why do they not care? If I didnt send anything in the group chat and if I didnt ask anyone to start, they wouldve just taken the 0 and not care. Why do they just leave the work to someone else?

The presentation slaps, with really good animation and everything. Its the best presentation the teacher is ever gonna see, and I put my all into it. When I felt like sleeping, I stayed up. I put in so much work while they just dont wanna do anything. I hate grouped projects so much man. Now theyll get a 100 for doing basically nothing.",3sperr,3,4,0.7

Hangout with friends make relationships, all that stuff, and I’ve always wanted to go to the typical Hollywood high school because I thought id be interesting, 

But all that goes out the window, my new high school is massive, vertically, yes it’s very tall and it’s entirely technological based Eg. 

all homework/updates on school will be sent via a school assigned computer so always have to check that, and couple that with the fact that I’ve also recently moved houses and I feel overwhelmed. 

Expectations have all gone out the window, not to say I didn’t expect something to go wrong but this is way too much.

I also get home around 5 which I think is pretty late and I get really sad when I think about how much time I have left in the day, how little days I get for weekends/breaks, and how long I’ll have to do this for

I’ve always known that lots of people get depressed in high school but right now I’m not sure what I’m feeling,

Please not that I am not condoning this in any way but if your gonna do it, might as well do it right! Also I am in Sweden so might be a bit different but should work other places too.

No More Calls home:

This is actually pretty simple! First make a new Email which looks like your parent/parents email so something like this:

[Jane-Doe@gmail.com](mailto:Jane-Doe@gmail.com)

And then get a friends phone number or a yours(doesn't really matter, although if bot your parents are registered in the school you will need 2 numbers and 2 mails)

Now just simply go to the person in control of these systems and say that your parents had to switch phone number and mail due to losing access or something, then give them the new mail and phone number.

Please note that if you are going to do both parents you should do them a few months/weeks apart so it is not suspicious.

Also make sure you are active in responding to these mails so they don't get suspicious!

Cheating on tests:

So me and my friends have a technique where we call each other before the test and use a small earbud connected to the phone. then walk in with it in your hand and put it in during the test.

Cough a little so your friend knows you are ready.

Now you can either whisper the question or if you give them a text beforehand they will read it to you.

1 tap with a pencil means wait

2 taps means re-read

3 taps means spell it out

4 taps means re-read the whole passage.

We usually do this for French tests and Spanish tests but it has also worked for science and math.

2nd method

If you and your friend has the same test before you, they write the questions down so you can use google to solve them and then you just memorize it or use the other technique.

Skipping school:

Either do the normal sick method or wait until thee halls are crowded and then walk out through a remote door and no one will suspect a thing.

Keeping your phone through out the day:

Just say that your phone is at home or give them a dummy phone :)

That being said even if I retake Spanish next year instead of just doing summer school to pass I'll have all my required classes done; only thing I would need to do senior year would be English 12 but, if I do summer school I wouldn't need anything else.

I'm confused about it though? If I had passed I genuinely wouldn't have anything else to do. I don't know if I'm misinterpreting graduation requirements or something because I just don't see why everything would be laid out for be to graduate in 3 years if Highschool is supposed to be 4; its not like I did anything extra either. I know seniors usually get early dismissal but, if most people don't fail classes wouldn't they just graduate early? 

(would like to add the reason I'm so confused is because I went to a private school before where we didn't pick any classes or anything so I never really thought about my cred requirements everything was just picked out for me)",Practical_Step_3930,4,2,1.0
14,Extracurriculars for people who are not artistic or sporty,11a842q,"Hi, 

I’m not sure if this it where I should post this, but I’m hoping it’s for the best.

I’m a sophomore in high school and involved in only one extracurricular, which is my school’s French club. I am aware that college require much more than one and most likely of competitive value, however I am having trouble finding things that I would like to do without making me miserable.

I’m not an athletic or artistic person by nature, this includes anything with drama. I enjoy reading and writing the best, and spend a fair chunk of my spare time to these activities. I also enjoy photography.  I was thinking of applying to volunteer at my local library or my regional aquarium. I know that I need to start these activities before the end of my sophomore year. 

Any help is immensely appreciated!!

I'm really conflicted about it because 1) I do enjoy band(I won't be quitting music in HS, I'm staying in the guitar program) 2) it's going to look bad on college apps quitting as a sophomore 3) it would allow more time towards my academics, other EC's, and just time for myself out of school.

I have the option to move to a big school with lots of different people, more clubs, sports and opportunities. My issue is that in my current school there is a small selection of people, so I can basically join all the clubs and sports here and find that the teachers are more accommodated to everyones individuals learning styles and I guess I feel comfortable here. I just need some advice on if i should take the risk at a new big school and really meet more people of my culture and build a bigger mindset, work hard to be in different clubs (since i don’t even have to try out for anything at my current school) or stay at my small town school and just ride it out until I graduate since I feel more comfortable and “successful” here.",Limenail,0,1,1.0

I'm currently studying at a federal school, and the pressure and monotony of it all is seriously taking a toll on my mental health. So, I've been thinking about switching to a private school.

But here's the catch: one of my technical course teachers doesn't really seem to care about teaching, and a lot of students end up failing his subject. If I do switch to a private school, I'll have to repeat the academic year since they don't allow you to pass a subject that you've previously failed.

Now, I know this might sound like a whim, but I promise it's not. My psychologist even thinks that incorporating other activities into my life would be really helpful, since my current routine doesn't allow for much of that. Plus, the private schools I'm considering are in great locations, so I'll have more opportunities to get out and about.

Not only that, but at a private school, I'd also have access to extra humanities classes that would help me prepare better for college entrance exams and college itself.

But, my dad is totally against the idea. He thinks that all the stress and pressure I'm dealing with now will be good for me in the long run, both academically and financially. I'm afraid to bring up the advantages of private schools because he might only focus on the money, even though we can afford it.

First one (CAS calculator allowed):

For risk assessment and in preparation for a large music festival, the temporal evolution of the number of arriving fans on the arrival day is modeled based on measurements from previous years. The instantaneous arrival rate is described by the function 𝑓(t) with 𝑓(t)=30 • t^(4) • 𝑒^(-0.12t^2) ; 0≤t≤24 described (t time in hours after the start of admission, 𝑓(t) in fans per hour). At the start of admission, there are no fans at the entrance yet. A maximum of 1000 fans can pass the security check at the entrance per hour.

1. Calculate the number of fans arriving in the first 6 hours!
2. Calculate the time from which a queue forms at the entrance!
3. Calculate the number of fans that make up the longest queue according to the modeling!
4. Determine the time at which the queue has completely dissolved again!

second one (no calculator allowed, only brain):

The point P on the y-axis is equidistant from 𝐴(3;4;-7) and 𝐵(-1;2;1).

1. Find the coordinates of the point P!
2. Find the components of the vector 𝑣⃗=(𝑣𝑥;𝑣𝑦;3) such that |𝑣⃗|=7, the x-component is greater than the y-component by 8 LU.

why is highschool so badly run compared to elementary school.

all our classes were taught in the same room so no need to shuffle through the halls to different rooms. and when we did move classes the teacher would bring us in an orderly single file line. teacher was responsible for us arriving on time instead of being late. liability was all on the teacher. 

the same teacher taught each class so they were accountable for not putting all our tests on the same day. 

basically highschool was an all around sh*tty experience compared to elementary school.  the teachers had way more accountability and if things were not going well blame fell on the teachers.

64,Has anyone gotten out of truancy for good grades?,118cxqc,"Don’t really know where to ask this, so if you have any recommendations of other places please let me know.

I’m a senior in high school who just recently got a letter in the mail for truancy. This makes sense—I am usually marked absent at least once a day, if not more (sometimes just because I’m super late, tho). However, I’m also a senior who has a 3.82 unweighted GPA who is only taking AP classes this year (AP gov, AP Lit, AP Calc BC, and AP Bio). It’s safe to say my poor attendance does not affect my ability to excel.

I skip a lot of school because attending school has actually made my grades drop in the past. When I regularly attend class, I feel incredibly drained for the rest of the day. When I’m drained, I struggle to do my homework or attend my extracurriculars (volunteering at the hospital and tutoring 2 other students). 

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and I suspect this is a symptom of my anxiety (however I don’t actually feel anxious while at school, so I’m not sure). My mom and I have considered asking for a 504 plan several times, but we’ve never decided to go through with asking for it since we didn’t feel that my ability to succeed was being heavily impacted by it.

Apparently, the district disagrees. We haven’t been fined yet (thank goodness) but we did receive the long letter in the mail which is basically one step before receiving a fine.

So, I’m asking anyone who sees this: can you get out of truancy as a senior with a high GPA/good grades (almost all As)? I want to continue taking these classes because I enjoy the subjects, so I don’t want to graduate early (plus I’d have to get an alternative diploma which would close many doors for me).

Attending class more often will likely not be a viable option, because I don’t want my grades or enjoyment of the subjects to be hindered by attending school more often. I know it sounds backwards but it’s just how I learn.

Edit: would it be worth pursuing a 504 plan for this?

Edit 2: I wasn’t very clear about my anxiety issues, so I will clarify. My anxiety has manifested itself primarily as performance anxiety, however it has popped up differently throughout my life. I don’t feel anxious just being at school, however I do feel incredibly anxious before school. The usual “school dread” is much more significant for me than it is for someone without anxiety.

When I say I feel drained, I don’t just mean I wanna relax and sit on my phone or something stupid like that. I mean after attending school, even for just an hour, I literally feel like I’m going to collapse and like I need to sleep for a million years. I often get somewhere between 6-8 hours of sleep every night, however even on nights where I get 10+ hours of sleep I still feel like collapsing after getting home from school. Oftentimes I will fall asleep. I will sleep for 6-8 hours at night (11pm to 7am usually) and then get home from school and sleep for another 5-6 hours.

This only happens with school. I had a job over the summer and was fine. I volunteer at the hospital and tutor other students, which does not affect me this way. It is *only* school. To be even more specific, it has only been elementary school, middle school, and high school. I also have college courses and they do not drain me. 

For those calling me “lazy but smart”… What do you spend your time doing? I’m taking 4 AP courses, self studying 3 more, taking a college course, volunteering at the hospital, tutoring 2 kids consistently, and tutoring others for drop-ins at a Writing Center. I’m by no means the most active or hardworking student out there but lazy?? I think that’s a stretch.

Less than 48 hours ago I posted this and it got much more attention than I anticipated, thank you all so much for the support and sorry I couldn't reply to all the comments and DMs, there were just so many. I posted an update edit on the post but I checked the post insights and the views have plummeted since I edited it and only 2 new comments. Then I've seen some people posting new posts and linking the old ones back instead so that the people who commented on the first one will see there's an update, new to Reddit here.

This is what I wrote:

UPDATE: Wow I am overwhelmed by all of the comments and DMs! I never expected the posts both here and on [r/smalldickproblems](https://www.reddit.com/r/smalldickproblems/) to get so much attention. Currently the posts have a combined 23.3K views, 129 comments, 26 shares and I have received 10 DMs. I'm sorry I won't be able to keep up with all of the comments and I'd like to say thanks to everyone for the support and advice but please settle down with the DMs, it's gonna take me a while to answer all of them.

On the situation, he didn't come to school yesterday(Monday) and as I'm writing this it's Tuesday morning(Australia). I am really struggling what to decide what to do because I've had such mixed advice, but I've had some other guys with small dicks DM me and most of them said to pass a note to him to talk later and explain that I though what happened to him was terrible and that I think he's great just the way he is. Then I'll ask him to go out for lunch with me on the weekend or after school. To the people telling me to take him in to bathroom and ""see how big it really get's"", sorry to let you down but that's not gonna happen, at least not yet. You're also right, I was being cowardly by not sticking up for him more and considering ignoring him because I was afraid how it would affect my social life, at the very least, I'm gonna make sure I'll be friends with him and if any of my friends aren't okay with that then they can fuck off.

As for the legal and administrative action, I'll wait until I've spoken to him and we'll see how it goes, I'll support him but I won't do anything behind his back because ultimately it's his choice how he wants to proceed. Hopefully he's at school today and if so I'll tell you how it went this arvo(remember the time difference). Thanks again everyone, I feel so empowered to make this right after feeling all the encouragement and humanity this initiated. Wish me luck.

UPDATE 2: Okay so I had English last period and was expecting to see him then and hand him the note but after I got out of Mum's car I saw him straight away ahead of me so I sped up to catch up to him. I said ""Hey"" when I reached him and he got startled because he was walking alone and I was catching my breath. He said hey back and he stopped to look me in the eye with nervous anticipation. I asked him if he wanted to come meet me down at the farm after school and he hesitantly said yes. I was strongly hoping no-one else would be there. I texted Mum during break and told her I was going to walk home with my friends.

I walked in to English and I waved at him(he was already seated when I walked in). After the lesson finished I was walking out and chatting with my friends and walked to the carpark expecting to see Mum there because I almost forgot but then suddenly remembered and started walking over to the farm. Poor guy must've thought I stood him up because I saw him standing there looking for me, but I waved at him and he stood there waiting for me to catch up. As we were walking I asked how his day was and he asked me how mine was. He said he was nervous to come but felt great after seeing me this morning. We weren't quite there but no-one was around so we stopped to begin talking.

I grabbed his hands and asked ""So how are you feeling since last week?"", he responded ""Oh well, I'm fine"" but I could tell he wasn't and he looked terrified of me. Now luckily I remembered somebody called ""u/johnlucas-selfimage"" on the post on smalldickproblems, advising me what to say: ""**Those people had NO RIGHT to do that to you. I am so sorry for what you went through. You do not deserve this. Nobody deserves this. I want to be your friend. I will support you through this. I will stand up for you. If you ever need someone to talk to or rely on, I'm here for you. I want to be your friend. I'm not going to hurt you like they did.**""(thank you for this comment). I didn't remember it word for word but I repeated it as accurately as I could. The poor thing looked down and stuttered so I held his face and said ""It's okay, you've got no reason to be ashamed, I think you've got a beautiful penis."" He looked up at me, his face trembled and a few tears came out of his eyes ""Really?"" he said. I nodded and he tried to hold his crying back, I hugged him and he still tried to hold it back. He said ""Thank you so much for this. I was horrified at the thought of coming back and I thought only my friends were gonna comfort me, I never thought a pretty girl like you would"". I said ""Aww that's okay"" and he said ""You promise you're not trying to set me up or anything?"" I assured him I wasn't and I hugged him again. I asked ""Do you wanna grab lunch with me on Saturday"" and he said yes. I gave him my phone number and we said goodbye, I winked at him as I walked away and he got all embarrassed which I thought was really cute.

It was about a 20 minute walk home and I explained the whole situation to Mum and Dad when I got home, they were shocked and commended me for the way I acted. I texted him later to ask if he knew what happened to the 3 people that pantsed him and he said the principle called his mother to explain to him what happened and that the 3 students got a 2 week suspension.

83,I (15F) want to start a baking club at school to host a biweekly bake sale fundraiser for SickKids Hospital. Is this a good idea considering the following factors?,117kk4u,"Hello! I am 15 years old and a Gr. 10 high school student in Ontario. This semester I don't have many challenging classes so I have more free time to do other things. Club idea forms are going out now for my school and I thought I could start a baking club and then sell the baked goods for a SickKids fundraiser. Is this too optimistic? I've never held a bake sale before so I'm not sure how much people would pay and I'm not sure what a reasonable fundraising goal is.

**Plans**

1. *Route 1:*  
Host a baking club biweekly with an entrance fee of $10-$15 to get ingredients. Thereafter I will use 50% of profits to buy more ingredients and 50% to go to the fundraiser. Any leftover money will be put into the fundraiser. The bake sale could be held at school (I would have to ask guidance for permission, he didn't reject when I brought up the baking club), however I am worried about allergies and how it would work with my school schedule. At my school, lunch can be periods 1-5, so to get the most people to buy I would have to miss all of my classes to host this sale.
2. *Route 2:*  
Same fees and plan, however instead of selling at school, I could go door to door on the weekends. I don't have much to do on those days, but I am unsure if people would be open to buying cookies or if they would be upset I bothered them on the weekend.

**Considerations**

1. I am not a good baker. I think there would be a lot of screw-ups when baking with beginners at my school.
2. I don't know if people would buy the baked goods, especially considering how they might be malformed because we aren't expert bakers.
3. I don't know what a reasonable price is for a treat, ex. a cookie. I also don't know how much I would need to sell it for to be able to keep buying ingredients while also reaching X fundraiser goal.
4. There is a Food and Nutrition course at my school and they bake sometimes. I could ask the teacher there to be our sponsor and advisor. However, I haven't met her before so I'm not sure if she'd be willing to help.
5. I'm not sure how to account for how many people will buy and how many won't.
6. Baking is a big thing at our school. Many of my classmates took the aforementioned course and many are taking it this semester. If the club grows too big I'm not sure how I would manage that, so I put the entrance fee to deter some people. Then again, I'm not sure if that many people would even want to join!

**Reasons for starting this club**

1. I want to be more involved in school.
2. Good extracurricular.
3. I am a patient at SickKids and I want to give back.
4. I want to step out of my comfort zone and try something new.
5. I would like to do something special before Gr. 11 so that I can focus on my grades next year.

**Questions**

1. If I sell someone a treat without a nutrition/ingredients label and they have an allergic reaction, am I responsible? Should I just make a label or if it's at school should I make them sign their name on a form?
2. Would I be liable for any injuries? Should I send out a form first and get participants to sign it?
3. Should I get someone else to host this club with me? Should I just drop the idea?
4. If anyone else here has held a bake sale or club, what tips would you give me? For those who held a bake sale, what profits did you make and how successful/unsuccessful was it?",xaiyzu,9,3,1.0

103,How do I survive second semester of senior year?,116msoh,"Hello, I'm a senior in High School and I am struggling academically and socially.

I have been involved in my schools music (choir) and theatre program for the past 3 years, and I loved it. But I have burned out of my interest in theatre in particular. I got a chorus role in my schools musical, and I really have disliked this years production. We perform in two weeks, and I really wanna call it quits. Rehearsals are long and unproductive, cast members and directors are complete bullies, and I am not having fun like I used to.

The bigger reason I am struggling, is that I have been a completely different person in high school than who I wanna be, and on top of that, I have realized that most of my choir / musical friends are incredibly mean and toxic, and have been leaving me out of events, hang outs, etc. for the past year and a half. I've never had a social life in HS, but I easily could've if I would've not have been left out of everything. These so called friends dump all of their drama to me, are chronic complainers, and are incredibly negative in general. I really can't be friends with these people anymore.

In regards to the ""completely different person"" thing, I have been pressured to only do musical theatre by my friend group. I have been really interested in visual art for the past couple of months and really want to explore that more, but I feel like it's too late. And as always, senioritis is kicking my ass, and I'm flunking a class or two.

110,"16(f) This guy at my school got his shorts pulled down and we all saw his penis, it was quite small. He got extremely embarrassed and looks mortified every time I see him. I feel so sorry for him and want to make him feel better. How do I do that?",1167lk6,"A month ago my family recently moved towns and I started going to the new local school. The new school seems a bit harsher and the people there are less friendly, there seems to be more bullying and more of a social hierarchy. Luckily even as a new kid I fitted in well quickly because I'm pretty and made friends with the relatively popular kids.

I had seen this boy around regularly and share my English class with him, he is geeky and seems very smart but he never looks happy. I knew he probably got bullied and people were often mean to him in the one class I share with him. He always seemed nervous to speak in front of the class and I noticed one of my friends was quite rude to him, but being the new girl I never really felt the courage to defend him. He is so shy that I barely even spoke with him but in any scrap of conversation we had I was always kind to him and always thought he was kinda cute.

2 days ago though, just as the break had started I was walking with my friends to our normal area. We were under the upstairs B block balcony which is usually the busiest route after breaks as some junior classes are held at A Block which is near the library where seniors usually are and the juniors usually hang out closer to the oval as that's where most of their classes are.

It was busy as usual and I saw that boy walking down the stairs about 20 meters ahead of me while some other boys were at the top yelling at him and laughing, then this one comes running down behind him just as he got to the bottom and slammed him in to the wall, about half of the people stopped to watch on while the others kept going. Then very quickly a few more came down including a girl, one of them grabbed him along with the other who already had a hold of him.

He started to struggle and try to escape but the 2 guys who were both bigger than him were holding him firmly, that's when the crowd started to quieten down and all surrounded him. I'm quite short so it was hard for me to see beyond the crowd but I walked around the side to try and get a closer look and a few seconds before I got there I heard the whole crowd gasp collectively. Then when I got there I saw exactly why.

His shorts and underwear were down to his ankles and the crowd of at least 100 students saw him exposed and yes, it was pretty small. The 2 guys were still holding him and pulled his shirt up and the girl had just walked back from closely behind him, clearly being the one who pulled them down. He had thrown his head back and I could see he was very distressed, he struggled really hard to get out but they wouldn't let him go. The girl then placed her thumb on his hip and shouted ""I think my thumb is bigger!"". The crowd roared in laughter and the most heart-breaking look came over his face.I pushed as close to the front as I could and shouted ""let him go"" but they just ignored me and then a teacher came racing over and started screaming at them. So they pushed him to the ground and the teacher yelled ""Everyone get away now!"". Everyone started to slowly leave and the poor guy burst in to tears. I looked back at him and we locked eyes for about a second but he then pulled his shorts up and ran away. I then just heard the teacher shouting at the 3 of them for as far as I was in earshot as my friends and I walked away.

Out of the 4 of them, only 1 expressed any sympathy for him and said something like ""That was so fucking mean, I can't believe they did that to him"". While the others just focused on how small it was. I've seen him around a few times and he just holds his head low looking mortified to even be there. At English class yesterday people were waving their pinkie at him as we entered and he put his face in his hands. I said hi to him as we were entering to try and be friendly but he just nodded and avoided me. He sat in his usual seat by the window silently, looking like he would rather be anywhere else.

I just feel so bad for him and despite what almost everyone else seems to think, there was no excuse for doing that to him. I just don't see how a guy having a small penis(which is obviously something he's going to be embarrassed about) justifies teasing him for it. Nor does someone being nerdy and awkward justify humiliating him like that at a place he has to attend 30 hours a week.

I thought you guys would have the best advice on how to to make him feel better, it's the weekend now and I imagine he will be spending a great deal of it crying in to his pillow wanting to die. What should I say to him? How do I comfort him? I wish I had said something earlier but I wasn't going to do it in front of everyone and the only way around it was to somehow approach him in public as those were the only times I saw him and ask to speak to him in private which just seemed too god-damn awkward to do and feared it would embarrass him further. Do you think he would maybe just want to forget about it as soon as possible and not want me to bring it up? I am pretty sure people will continue to bully him for it for a long time and I thought maybe if I could be the one to share some kind words to him, it would be of comfort and relief for him. Or am I wrong? I don't know. Any advice would be greatly appreciated to help me decide ultimately what to do. Thank you!

Currently the posts have a combined 23.3K views, 129 comments, 26 shares and I have received 10 DMs. I'm sorry I won't be able to keep up with all of the comments and I'd like to say thanks to everyone for the support and advice but please settle down with the DMs, it's gonna take me a while to answer all of them.

On the situation, he didn't come to school yesterday(Monday) and as I'm writing this it's Tuesday morning(Australia). I am really struggling what to decide what to do because I've had such mixed advice, but I've had some other guys with small dicks DM me and most of them said to pass a note to him to talk later and explain that I though what happened to him was terrible and that I think he's great just the way he is. Then I'll ask him to go out for lunch with me on the weekend or after school. To the people telling me to take him in to bathroom and ""see how big it really get's"", sorry to let you down but that's not gonna happen, at least not yet. You're also right, I was being cowardly by not sticking up for him more and considering ignoring him because I was afraid how it would affect my social life, at the very least, I'm gonna make sure I'll be friends with him and if any of my friends aren't okay with that then they can fuck off.

As for the legal and administrative action, I'll wait until I've spoken to him and we'll see how it goes, I'll support him but I won't do anything behind his back because ultimately it's his choice how he wants to proceed. Hopefully he's at school today and if so I'll tell you how it went this arvo(remember the time difference).

119,I don't think I'll get enough hours for my school's NHS (National Honor Society) Chapter,115tt6w,"For background: If you don't know what NHS is I'll explain it in the most simple way possible...

National Honor Society is a special club that requires students to volunteer a certain number of hours. You have to have a clean slate and a high GPA to get in. I believe for my school it's a 3.5 unweighted at least. The teachers who host it have to follow certain rules that the organization puts in place. Some high schools probably don't offer it though.

This is my first year in National Honor Society, and while I love going out a helping people from volunteering I just don't think I'm going to make the required hours needed. I can easily get individual hours without a problem but club hours are what I really struggle to get.

For starters, there are so many people in the club. So it feels like your competing with everyone else to get a certain event. Our events feel few and far between too, so there are less opportunties. When one is posted, it's almost a race to see who can get on the sign up website first. (It doesn't really feel fair.) When I'm lucky enough to get the event sign up in time, it's usually something I can't make because I already have plans.

What's even more stressful is that every quarter there's a certain amount of hours you have to complete. If it's the end of the quarter and you miss a few, those double and just make things worse. It's like credit card debt!

The whole thing is just a mess. Even if I do make the hours needed it might be even harder next year for my junior year when I'll be much busier with an afterschool job and harder classes. But I feel like I'm stuck in it. I'm not in all AP classes (I'll probably only take 2 at most my entire high school years) so I feel like I'm at a disadvantage when it comes to looking good for colleges. NHS feels like it might be one of the only things going for me besides my A's.

Is anyone else on here in NHS and can relate to my experience? Were you able to make all your hours despite being in a large club?

124,I'm about to fail my math class. What do I do?,115nu6p,"I (14F) am a freshman taking Precalculus. I was a straight A student until I hit high school. Currently, all my other classes (Biology, English, AP Chinese, Latin) are in the A range––but my math grade is a lovely C minus.

I will say that I'm not the only person who's on the brink––the majority of my math class is hanging on for dear life. Our class recently took two tests and both of them had class averages of 60-70. This led our teacher to chide us for ""not using our brains"" and having the poorest performance he's seen in his seventeen years of teaching Precalc. 

When my mom found out about my math grade, she signed me up for an out-of-school math tutor. I also check in regularly with my parents about what and how I'm doing in math class. (They grew up in China, where math education is hardcore.) Thankfully, they're not the kind of parents who freak out about bad grades, but, quite frankly, I wouldn't blame them if they were. My math grade is *abysmal.*

I swear I study. I do all the homework. I meet with my tutor weekly. I watch Khan Academy videos when I don't understand. I take careful notes. I have realized that I have some destructive study habits (such as not checking my homework or reviewing old assessments) and I'm working on overcoming them, but it's a process. I used to ask for extra help from my math teacher, but after he lost his temper in front of the class, he unnerves me. I suppose I've got to suck it up at some point. I am making progress––as in, one test was a 60 and the subsequent one was a 79––which counts for something, but it doesn't feel like enough. I still feel stupid. I still feel hopeless.

I have no idea what to do. I can't believe I let myself fall this far. I literally feel my heart rate climb whenever I step into the math classroom. I can't move down to a lower level math class because it would mess with my schedule. So far, my game plan is to continue with tutoring, and at the end of the year, either go to Calc AB or take Precalculus again. I hope I can drag my grade up in the spring term; there's no saving it for winter.

131,Student Parlement Debate,115809s,"Hi, just joined Reddit because I needed some outside counsel regarding my situation so please excuse me being naïve.

I assume y’all know what a student council is or all least have an idea of what it is. Anyways, I am a member of the student parlement at my school with 9 other kids. We debate about stuff like school lunches, clubs, and gender tolerance. Sometimes kind of serious, other times not. And then we pressure the school into changing whatever the parlement voted on.

Getting to the point, one of the topics that has been discussed but not resolved in the schools safety drills. After the shooting in Texas last year, we decided that we needed to improve our safety drills.

Here are some viewpoints that the other kids have.

- Two kids say that a fake shooter should be hired in order to test the current drills capabilities and improve after the test.

- One kid said that the drills are fine as they are.

- Another kid said to ask the school to form stronger ties with the police station.

- Three kids said that more viewpoints should be collected from the student body.

- And the final three, including me, abstained from voting but everyone needs to vote in order for ‘proper calculations’.

I honestly don’t know what to do. I sort of agree with all of them but they all have their cons for me. The next parlement meeting is on Wednesday next week for the final vote and so I really really really wouldn’t mind other peoples opinions on the whole thing.

Hi! My name is Ashley and I am a student in AP research surveying teenagers in high school in the US (freshman up to senior year). The purpose of this study is to identify any correlations between parenting styles and teen sexting (attitudes and behaviors). Correlation does not equal causation, but I am curious to see the results for the sake of this project! This survey is completely voluntary and you may think of yourself or someone you know well when answering questions. I write this due to the fact that sexting is text messages and/or sexual visual content, which texting is protected speech while the visual content is not (it is illegal and considered child pornography for those under the age of 18). Thank you so much for reading and responding to the survey if you would like to!

**I, however, have seen further potential in the Internet than that:**

- More online services exist, such as Brilliant, though that is premium.

- YouTube has other channels, like 3Blue1Brown, Action Lab, Stand-up Maths, Tom Scott, Veritasium, and Vsauce. MindYourDecisions encourages practicing the problems shown. The comments also tend to contain intelligent insight.

- Discord servers exist for academic disciplines, like the Mathematics server and the Science and Technology server.

- Reddit has plenty of subs that cover academic disciplines, like r/biology, r/chemistry, r/compsci, r/literature, r/math, and r/Physics. This can also include asksubs, like r/AskComputerScience, r/AskHistorians, r/AskPhysics, and r/askscience, and the learnsubs, like r/learnmachinelearning, r/learnmath, and r/learnspanish. The massive help sub r/explainlikeimfive can also work.

- Twitter can work well if you follow individuals or organizations dedicated to educational content; this also includes the corresponding Twitter accounts of the aforementioned educational services and YouTube channels. Following enthusiasts, experts, instructors, and PhDs in certain fields leads to more accurate information regarding said fields, and I do not doubt that, like YouTube, their posts will also attract intelligent comments.

- Even other social media has the potential, like [this TikTok channel](https://www.tiktok.com/@tutorzed?lang=en) and [this other TikTok channel](https://www.tiktok.com/@why_axis_), as well as the corresponding social media accounts of the educational services mentioned above. Again, I don't doubt that the comments are positively influenced by the audience they attract. And I don't doubt that at least some field enthusiasts, experts, instructors, and PhDs use social media to post educational content.

168,Transferring schools,113fvnj,"Hello, 

Here's info on my situation. I am a high school student whos courseload was changed towards the beginning of the year and was forced upon some courses that I did not intend to take.  I talked to assistant principals, but they wouldn't budge, claiming that my schedule was now set in stone. With no other options, I talked to my counselor, who allowed me to switch out of the program and choose an AP course load that reflected my STEM interests. However, my program coordinator stepped in and changed my schedule to bar me from my original path, arguing that I needed to take other courses that I was not interested in taking this year. The coordinator expressed feelings of betrayal and reprimanded me for my actions. She then proceeded to destroy my relationships with my counselor and administrators. She forced my principal's hand into rejecting my switch in an attempt to teach me a lesson, and subsequently destroyed all hope of ever establishing a relationship with any of the administration by labeling me as nothing more than an unruly child. I've been trying to fix my situation for the past three months, talking to each of my administrators, but unfortunately, all have been unable or unwilling to help. I've even set up a meeting between my parents and the school administration, which also got me nowhere. I can't help but remain anxious about my academic future, constantly worrying about if I can meet my academic goals because of my coordinator's influence. As a last resort, I want to set a transfer to go to a different school within my county. Any ideas?

I'm thinking of taking it for summer school, but I have a summer program in July. Thus, Ill have to take it in August, BUT im also planning to take grade 12 English for August of summer school so ill have an easier grade 12 year.

Here are my choices:

Should I take grade 11 physics in August? or grade 12 English for August?

Should I take grade 11 physics in August and grade 12 English in the following year?

Should I take grade 12 English in August and grade 11 physics in the following year?

Should I cancel the summer program and take both courses in July and August?

212,Questions about courses!,111sbu5,"so, currently (semester 2) I have Calculus and Vectors first period, then a spare, followed by world issues, and then lastly Chemistry. 

I am thinking of switching world issues out for kinesiology, because I am interested in science (especially bio type courses)  and might be more interested in kinesiology. Although, I also want to have an easier course in that spot as I don’t require either kin, or world issues. I am under the impression that world issues would be easier, but I am thinking I might not be so interested in it? 

 Although, my only course the uni would take is last semesters data management, where I had an 88. (I think they take both functions and calc for science based courses.) So I need higher than an 88 in either world issues or kin.

I have a dilemma. I currently attend a public high school and recently applied to a good private high school close by.  I was wondering what should I do if I get accepted into this private school? Should I go there? Or should I stay in my current public high school? My current public high school has a few clubs, few AP classes, and overall is an okay high school. They value school spirit and tradition instead of what other schools value (students achievements and other honors). But the biggest problem with school is the lack of clubs and competitions. Next year, I am aiming to do the most and try to compete in some competitions. I want to apply to Ivy league schools and major in biology, but I don't know if this decision matters as much. This private school has a lot of difficult classes and clubs and it also has a great soccer team. But this school is not as diverse as the one I am attending. All I want to do is would attending this private school change anything? Would it give me a better opportunity? I have not been accepted to this school and I don't think I will be accepted to this school, but I am only asking if this scenario should happen. 

Another thing I am not sure about is whether I should go do an internship or go to a summer camp at a private high school and do their college summer classes?

234,Highschool is literally the easiest but hardest year of my life!,110vuqp,"I'm freshmen. I think that should say alot about me. I'm currently in my second term. And I used to be this topper and prodigy student before. And also in the first term. But the second term came... I started dating. OK I'm not blaming my problems on the fact I started dating but... I mean come on it kinda makes sense. My boyfriend vapes and smokes and does all of that kinda stuff so I was influenced to also get into it and started smoking, vaping, drinking and so on. So like at first everything was fine, it was new, it was nice, cute, but then fights started happening. I constantly got distracted by them that I started falling back in studies. I already had family issues and my boyfriend didn't want me to talk to him about it and I also didn't have any friend I was comfortable telling either, and when my grades dropped I completely broke down. My escape from home and school became the streets. I'd tell my parents I'm off to walks and runs but I'd light up a cigarette or smth. One of my biggest fears is loosing my virginity so I never let that slip, which I'm very thankful for. My boyfriend isn't a complete jerk but he's just... weird! Sometimes he's acting all nice, sweet and caring but suddenly he's moody and gets mad and acts like I killed his cat! And on... Thursday, February 10th I think, I asked him if he liked a classmate of mine and he didn't want to answer it. He never responded but the answer was clear. He said he was embarrassed. I was so mad cuz then he said that he cared about us both which really pissed me off. But what pissed me off actually was that the same girl is someone I considered a friend! She knows I'm dating him yet she still openly has a crush on him. Also in the fast I've trusted her too much which ended in her telling everyone a secret of mine which made my family issues worse. I hated her for it but I decided to let it go. And now she's crushing on my boyfriend, I consider that crossing the line. My close friends who also know about our relationship tell me to break-up and honestly idk if I can do it cuz i really love him and it'd break me and make me go worse but they say it's better. Also my parents don't know about my relationship or anything, they think I'm still the nerdy prodigy they always knew. The school also doesn't know since dating is forbidden. It's literally Valentines tomorrow (it's 3:20 AM Monday February 13th for me) and I've no idea what's gonna happen. I'll have to see him at school tomorrow along with that girl. I really don't want to tho. Idk what's gonna happen but I'm afraid if I break-up with him this time I'll hit rock bottom and end up actually failing a class or smth. I've had multiple mental illnesses in the past and still suffer from some. I have depression, insomnia, anorexia and self-harming. I really don't wanna mess things up I just wish everything was just as before!! Also the ""easy"" part is that my lessons this year aren't hard and honestly super easy, past me would've had it really easy but current me is struggling even if all the classes are considered easy by everyone


Edit:- thanks to all of you in the comments, it makes me feel more confident knowing it's not just me who goes through smth like this and thanks for all the support. My boyfriend and I decided that we would break-up after valentines, and for one day we'll be just like friends and the next day we don't have to ever see each other ever again. It's like a parting gift I guess? And today I talked that friend of mine and explained to her my feelings and said my last words before dropping her. I actually opened up to my two best friends about alot of my problems and yes they jokingly bullied me at first (that's just how our friendship is) but then were really supportive and cheered me up and kept my mind off things. That's the best thing about them, they're better than any cigarette or vape or drug. I think I'll need time with that one. I'll have to eventually tell my parents and idk what's gonna happen. My studies, I'm currently taking a break from chemistry, I have an exam tomorrow and hopefully my studying first time in months pays off. Wish me luck.

249,Will bad grades for a Freshman High School year effect my chances of getting into a good college?,10zuqvr,"So, last semester I did bad. I'm talking about a 2.8 GPA. Long story short, I remade my work and got most of my grades up for most classes. But for 2 classes they had the same teacher (who resigned and therefore couldn't change my or a few other of my classmate's grades) which SEVERLY lowered my first semester GPA, although the grades weren't Fs. And for another class which was in-general just bad. I had a bit of a low grade for Algbera 2 as well (a C) which is NOT good because I want to go down an engineering career, or something similar.

This semester I'm doing good for most classes but my Math class (...again) and that isn't too good. The semester has been on-going for over a month now so I definitely got a good chance of bringing my grades back up for this semester.

Due to my school being pretty small we don't have many AP classes in-school, and outside of school I'm fairly busy. And due to my school being as small as it is, I can't redo my previous semester's classes.

Next year I'm probably gonna take AP classes even if they don't offer them in-school and I have to do them online. I don't know if this is gonna help but it's probably gonna help my GPA up.

My concerns are:

Are these grades gonna effect my chances of getting into a good college?

How can I fix my grades from the first semester without having the ability to redo them from the school directly?

If I choose an engineering path, will I have a lower chance of being accepted into engineering programs because of my GPA? Or can future semesters help bring back the GPA?",wxld94,19,1,0.57

251,what classes should i take for ux/ui design? am i suited?,10zt40k,"i've always been artistically inclined, and i think i have a good eye for graphic design. i've considered ui design because of this. i dont have much experience working with ui design softwares, but i'm only a freshman in school right now. currently i am taking an art class as well and i do enjoy it a lot. 

i especially am thinking of ux/ui design because it can combine my design aspect with  a tech related field--and it makes for a higher salary than if i were to be specifically art focused.

i've tried out coding html on freecodecamp, so just the bare basics, and i can't say i enjoy it too too much. however, im willing to give it another shot.

currently, i am doing pretty well in all areas of my academics, and ive always been sort of an all-rounder when it comes to academics. i'm just not really sure where my interests lie, but i know for sure that i am more of an artistic person. i'm not that worried about college right now, but i am considering the ivies. 

should i take cs classes? my school only offers java. or are there any other classes that might help ? and i'm also considering reaching for ap level art...would that be beneficial to me?",icemousse,0,1,1.0
252,Bilingualism survey for Texas High School Students,10zrax6," 

Hello! I am an AP Research student at Tomball Memorial High School. AP research is a College Board-created class that allows students to design, plan, and conduct a year-long research-based investigation to address a student-created research topic. I am gathering information about the correlation between being an Asian bilingual or multilingual high school student and academic success. As a part of my research, I would love for you to spread the word about my questionnaire! It should only take two minutes to complete, and all information, including information about your personal identity, will remain confidential. I have two surveys: one for high school students in Texas who are fluent in an Asian-based language, and one for high school students in texas who are not fluent in an Asian-based language. I have attached both survey flyers below. Thank you so much for your time, and I hope you have an amazing day!

253,How do American high schools work? Focusing more on Junior year,10zgl79,"Educational aspect : Here, when you're a freshman, You don't get to choose what you're studying - You study Physics, chem, biology, maths, history, geography, pol science, English same for sophomore year. In your junior year you get to choose between Maths and biology but Physics and chemistry are mandatory. Are American high schools any different? I've heard American juniors get to study a lot of interesting subjects in their junior year such as psychology and stuff. Is it true?

Social aspect : schools here suck - People don't talk to anyone, besides their best friends. Bullies, racists everywhere and junkies. The nerds are approachable but they are boring AF. From what i saw on Max resinger's vlogs American schooks seem to be the PERFECT schools. Everyone is very friendly, social, and they seem to help the shy peeps a lot.

254,Course Selection in high school is too hard,10zg6hz,"I know its long, but it really helps to have advice. 

Hi, to bullet point my situation. 

* Freshman year:
   * Have completed Chinese 1, but will be taking AP Japanese (my native language), which will fulfill my language requirements.
   * All honors and accelerated math + AP Human Geography
   * Extracurriculars: Track, Orchestra
   * Currently a freshman, honestly feels barely harder than middle school.
* Now for course selection
   * Thinking of taking AP Lang, AP World, Honors Chemistry, orchestra, and accelerated math 3(incorporates pre-calc as well), which will all be 5 GPA classes. I also do not need to study for math as I find it very easy.
   * As for extracurriculars: Orchestra is a must and also as the number of classes you can take does not change even if you take athletics, will be taking track. (just longer school time) 
      * I also wish to join teams of either science olympiad or robotics.
   * THE PROBLEM: As I will be taking AP Japanese, Chinese will only give me elective points, and have nothing to do with the requirements.
   * **Is it doable to take AP Lang, AP World, H Chem, Accelerated math 3, Chinese 2, Orchestra, Track, and an academics team sophomore year? I think extracurriculars would take an estimated 3-4 hours a day, with school ending at around 2:30. With some rest and eating, with 2 hours of studying a day(which I think is good enough), it would be barely fine to be able to finish everything at around 11.** ***Am I being too optimistic with my work ethic and time I would be able to finish all the work in?***
* Extra Stuff:
   * Junior Year:
      * I think thinking this far ahead is a bit unrealistic, but...
      * I want to take AP Calc BC, H Literature, AP Physics, APUSH, and a second science class (probably AP Chem or a harder AP Physics course), plus orchestra. This would make me even busier. I feel like this is unrealistic if I keep doing track and orchestra. **Is it better to prioritize extracurriculars or harder classes?**",pokosure,2,0,0.5

262,My history teacher would rather let the room become a biohazard than let me leave during a test.,10yxrba,"Blood tw if anyone needs it.

This is completely insane and I wish it was fake. I know this was incredibly stupid and petty of me, but I'm sick of my history teacher.

I'm anemic, and I get pretty severe nosebleeds, especially in the winter when the weather's cold and dry. No, cauterization hasn't worked. I get nosebleeds a couple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day. My teachers know about this, and by now i dont even have to ask to go to the nurse, I can just get a tissue and leave the room and they know. I've never faked a nosebleed to get out of a test, as I know getting caught faking once would ruin my teachers trust in me forever.

My history teacher is kind of an annoying hardass and acts like it's a personal offense to leave his class. Some kid has to leave early for a doctor appointment? He acts like they've just insulted his mother. It's kind of weird. I've gone to the nurse a few times and he's always let me go.

My school has recently had some pretty crazy cheating rings revealed among the juniors (I'm a junior) so the teachers are all kind of on edge, which I understand. 

I had a unit history test today, sneezed really hard, blew a blood vessel, felt the telltale feeling, and got a tissue and asked to leave, because i didn't want just to leave without asking during a test. My teacher asked where i was going, and told me to sit back down and finish my test, since no one was allowed to leave the room. I was totally appalled, since this had never happened to me before. I figured it wasn't worth fighting so i grabbed the tissue box to finish my test.

Nope. Not allowed apparently. He told me to put the box back, since i already had a tissue. He probably thought someone wrote on the tissue box to cheat? What the actual hell.

I was so sick of my history teacher being a dick for various other reasons to other students, and i figured if he wasn't going to let me take care of the literal biohazard, I was going to make him regret it.

If you have frequent nosebleeds, you know that one tissue is never enough, even for light ones that last a minute or two, and this was a GUSHER.

Because of the cheating, part of the new system, at least in my history class, was to move half the kids to the library with another teacher and half the kids (including me) would stay to make more space. Since there were only 10 kids in the room now, we were all pretty far apart, and i was sitting in the back. Turning to look around the room was forbidden and would be assumed as cheating, so this is why no one noticed what happened.

I went through the one tissue in about 30 seconds. Since i couldn't go get more, I kept bleeding, and blood got all over my test. I mean everywhere. It went through the paper and soaked everything. I eventually just gave up on holding the tissue and my test started to look more red than white. My bright yellow sweater front turned red. I looked like I got in a fight and broke my nose. I looked like I was a zombie for Halloween. I'm used to blood, so i wasn't freaking out, I was just really, really angry. I finished my test and turned it in, and my teacher finally looked up from his computer, noticed me, and was really taken aback.

Mr. S: What the hell happened to you?

Me: I went through the tissue. Can I go to the nurse?

Mr. S: Go. Just go.

Me, dragging this out as long as possible, dripping blood on the fucking floor: Do i need to make a pass? 

Mr. S: GET OUT NOW.

So i left. The nurse, who I'm friends with since I'm there so often, asked what happened, i told her. She just sighed and said she would talk to someone, and told me that if a teacher wouldn't let me leave to just ignore them. Since I wasn't pinching my nose to stop the blood, I lost a lot more than usual and had to stay with the nurse for longer because i felt faint.

I know what I did was wrong, and extremely mean and petty, but i really think my goddamn history teacher needed to be taken down a peg. But now my yellow sweater is fucking covered in blood and I couldn't wear it for the rest of the day and I wasn't binding that day and I felt terrible since I couldn't hide it.

I wouldn’t consider myself a lazy student, I really do try, but I have some concentration issues. I might study for maybe 30 minutes and decide to take a break, only for the break to be longer than my actual study session. I also have begun to do more extracurriculars because I didn’t really have that many in my freshman year of highschool. I have almost no missing assignments, aside from two which is because my teacher didn’t accept late work and I forgot to contact them while I was absent. I’m only taking honors classes at the moment which doesn’t boost my GPA sadly and the only options for AP’s for sophmores at my school were AP World and AP Art History. I’m not really a history person so I only went with Honors World. I’m thinking of what classes to sign up for next year (sign ups are due in about a month) to boost my GPA a bit so I have higher chance of getting into colleges, but I’m not sure how motivated I’ll be by then to actually put in more effort. 

Turning in assignments, getting work done is not a problem for me. Studying for exams however can be difficult and I’m not sure if it’s because I’m used to cramming things in one or two nights and usually that’s worked out fine for me. But I’m also not really motivated to do the work at much as I used to. Still, I kind of gave up on trying to get my grades perfect when I only have 1 week left and then finals to turn things around.

280,"Teacher who tries to make ""relatable"" assignments",10y7dmq,"This is mostly a rant post, but I'm also wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.

My US Gov teacher is constantly giving us assignments which I believe are meant to be relatable to our generation. Last week he gave us an assignment where we had to make a ""TikTok style video that briefly goes over the influence on US government from historical English political documents and colonial governments"". I'm usually fine with out of the box types of assignments, but what bothered me is that he couldn't give us an example video or at least a rubric of what he expects. Then when I thought it was over, this week he gives us an assignment where we have to make a ""meme or social media post about one or more of the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation"" (no guide or rubric for this one either).

I don't have social media ( I created this account, just cuz I wanted to talk about this somewhere, I'm probably gonna delete this soon anyway), so maybe that's why I don't really understand what I'm supposed to do. But these attempts just feel like a failed attempt at trying to connect with a younger generation through something ""fun"" and ""relatable"" like memes and TikTok. Honestly, I'd much rather have a test or even write a paragraph length response than do this. I don't really feel like I'm learning anything. It honestly just feels like a waste of time compared to my other homework. 

I feel like it should be mentioned that this teacher also gave us a semester long project where we have to write a policy proposal about some contemporary government issue. This is supposed to be a well researched article with multiple sources. On it's own this is a reasonable assignment, however, we're expected to do this for homework. I just wish that rather than those social media assignments he would give us class time to work on this instead. We are only half-way into the quarter and this is already the most stressful class I have (for context this is an honors class, of my other classes 4 are AP and one is honors).

She listed the options and mentioned that chemistry and physics was a lot of math, so I may not like them and I’d rather not do zoology or anatomy because I don’t want to to dissect animals. So it was either Earth and Space science or Astronomy, and my thought was “oh cool, studying stars and shit.” And picked Astronomy, she didn’t really describe it, she said it was what it sounded like. So I picked it and left. But I looked at the course description online and it requires geometry, I’m doing geometry now but and I’d rather not have a science class that is just glorified math.

294,why i quit my wrestling team. the highschool chronicle...,10xk4vi,"i was never excelling at sports. in fact, i guess i could say i wasn't really good at them to begin with, even playing little league as a wee lad. while my peers were hitting home runs, i was zoning out in the field somewhere.. picking away at the grass. then there was basketball, and i also wasn't great at that, but by the end i actually started to improve. i really didn't like neither. my parents just kinda made me do it but but eh, atleast i experienced it. after a while they let me stop with sports for a bit and let me do my own thing which was, at the time, playing videogames. then my freshman year at highschool rolls by..

come november 2019. my freshman year. i'm ready to make a change. i had always wanted to become a wrestler of sorts. i actually started taking mma classes for a short bit. i became obsessed with mma.. but this all happened so fast. i was still kind of an unathletic kid and i'd spent years without sports up until now. so you can imagine what my first practice was like. i couldn't feel my entire body the day after while everyone else pretty much just.. whizzed by. cause they've been doing it for years, and me, i was just a beginner.

but i tread on. attended every practice. even when i was injured. during the matches, i never did so good. i never won very many. i stayed on jv for a long time and the only time i got varsity was when i was the only 180 lb kid on the team that they just threw onto the line-up cause they needed someone, anyone. and all throughout these two years of wrestling, i still didn't really know what i was doing. shit i didn't even know a lot of the rules. but yeah, i trucked through all of that until the end of my sophomore year. i found it extremely difficult to stay motivated. especially since i dealt with a lot of bullshit from my teammates. tough love will make you stronger for sure, but a lot of times i felt like i was being targeted and it made me feel like total shit. i never stood for it but often times when i stood up for myself, they just shook their heads at me. losing interest, then eventually starting to hate what was once my passion, i started thinking about it.. what if i quit? so, junior year eventually rolls by and my thought process is different, like, im thinking, i'm not going really anywhere with this anyway. maybe i should start anew.

oh yeah and i forgot to mention, one of my (much) older cousins were one of the coaches there. so by quitting, obviously that upset them.. including part of my family who had had a history of wrestling. 

anyway i found something even better to do with my time since losing all of those matches got fucking OLD, and it was working. i honestly feel like i should've been doing this from the start. so once the season started getting closer and closer i had to break the bad news, and my cousin just so happens to be the head coach so it was him who i had to tell. and he was trying to convince me otherwise, telling me i could add wrestling and working a part-time job into my schedule, but i genuinely didn't want that. afterward, he felt like he had somewhat failed to coach me properly and i still feel a bit bad for that to this day. but the one thing that's gonna stick with me forever is one of the other coaches asking me ' Are you proud of yourself? '

and to be honest, i kind of was! i was starting my first job. i was finally gonna have money, and time to experience so many more things. i mean shit, i've had my ups and downs, but i can say it's just been better overall since once i quit, i felt free. to this day my family still isn't the happiest with my decision, but i know i am and thats what matters. i'm eighteen now and i still receive a bit of grief for it. what matters is my parents supported me in it, i'm glad to have supportive parents like that because i know a lot who would shut their kid down for it. like i said, i'm glad i made this decision, i mean, i got my first job out of it. i'm able to maintain an amazing relationship with this girl that i've been with for three months and a half now. she's the light of my life right now.

 i quit that job not long ago and since then money has been tight for me and i was on and off with jobs for a couple months, however i recently got hired at again and i'm working at a bar now. it's much more fast-paced and relatively better than any other job i've worked.

so, in conclusion, majority of my high school experience was pretty shit in general but it actually got better once i quit sports. i'm just happy i had the confidence to not follow the crowd and do my own thing, because in the long run that ended up being the much, MUCH better choice for me... i just can't wait until hell (high school) is over so i can move onto trade school.

I have never talked to her besides for business purposes ( such as asking which question we were supposed to work on and when we bought fundraising sweets from each other, she in fact trusted me to give her the money the next day when I didn't have any with me, is this a sign or me just overreacting?) Once she bought a fundraising sweet from me for a class she smiled at me, and I noticed she had braces just like me, which was the moment a light sparked inside of me, I smiled back at her so she can see I had braces too. Anyways I want to know how to talk to her, I tried to build up the guts to at least say hi to her before she sits down but my heart was beating like crazy and my confidence keeps goin up and down.
She seems smart, and sometimes I do stuff in class which I would never do in my life, like saying the correct answer when nobody speaks up, just a way to try and impress her I guess.

I am gathering information about the correlation between being an Asian bilingual or multilingual high school student and academic success. As a part of my research, I would love for you to spread the word about my questionnaire! It should only take two minutes to complete, and all information, including information about your personal identity, will remain confidential. I have two surveys: one for high school students in Texas who are fluent in an Asian-based language, and one for high school students in texas who are not fluent in an Asian-based language. I have attached both survey flyers below. Thank you so much for your time, and I hope you have an amazing day!

I think people at my school would be interested cuz ppl are always sliding 20s and 10s for nicotine vapes and weed. I'm sure I could sell my prop money to some freshmen and sophomore's that want to screw over their plugs. $200 a week isn't bad. I'm 16 and I don't plan on working till summer so its a good idea. Plus, if it doesn't sell i could buy some vapes off some freshman and then end up selling the vapes to other freshmen. Resulting in a bigger profit but way riskier.

331,My principal told me I should leave the program I'm in because I won't be attending the field trip,10vsmd1,"So this Thursday I'll be having a field trip with a program I'm in to improve the school, I will not identify the place of the trip but I will say it's at a huge coorperation. The program I'm in gives me an opportunity to apply for a scholarship as well as a course credit, but I could also apply to that scholarship without the use that program.

I emailed the coordinators of the program that I will not be coming due to my physics quiz being on that same Friday and having my student council meeting at 3:15pm. My principal emailed me the weekend before the trip and asked me to see her in her office - mind you I had no context what so ever about what she wanted to see me about because of how vague her email was, so I freaked out about why she wanted to see me.

I went to her office at lunch and she asked me why I couldn't attend the field trip, I explained to her the situation with my physics class and how if it were a half day - which is when the program would take half my classes for that day - it'd be easier for me because I could talk to my teachers about what I missed. That day is also a course fair where students can see and apply for what courses will be available for next school year and I wanted to apply for ap chem and physics and possibly ap calculus. She did say she'd inform my teachers to accommodate me, but I also feel reluctant about that because physics is such a heavy course, my teacher would be lucky to even be able to cover 4 units within a semester - yes this is something he's complained about. She continues on and says that if I were to miss one day, who is to say that I won't miss another day, and says if I decide not to show up for this field trip that I should consider leaving the program.

I told my partner, friend and parents about the situation. My partner, who's attending my physics class, thinks she overreacted and that if it's necessary to go on that trip then he'll take notes for me. My friend, who's part of the student council and wants me to become prez, told me to go on the trip to get on my principal's good side. My parents believe that I should discuss this with my physics teacher and ask him what he thinks, depending on his answer I would decide whether or not to go on the trip.",mymypotato321,1,1,0.6
332,How to handle this student athlete?,10vrkvy,"We had a conversation about her potential and attitude. I see her as being really talented, but she’s not getting D1 offers because her grades suck, she doesn’t try on defense, she cherry picks, and doesn’t try to get rebounds. I also hate how she pads her stats when we are blowing teams out. I was telling her to fix her focus, but she came back at me. Here are a list of hurtful things she said:

- She mentioned how my twin sister, one of the best girls in school history(I’m coaching at our Alma matter) was the better athlete and how I’m in her shadow, as well as my younger brother who plays pro ball.

- She spoke about how’s she’s a sophomore putting up better stats than I ever did and how I was never as good as she is or will be

- She threw it in my face that my wife is leaving me(idk how she knew that)

My mentor who helps coach said I need to run her half to death, but not suspend her. He said suspending her gives her power and makes it seem like she’s won. He said I need to run her and push her, since laziness needs to be handled with stiff boundaries and a high bar, not me putting her in timeout for being mean. Thoughts?",hhg79,2,2,1.0

334,What is your School Security like at your high school?,10vrf9o,"Things changed a lot at the high school I go to after Uvalde happened. I’ve always been curious but redditors what is your school security like for you? For me they introduced two new things: 1:ID Badges and 2:(I think) 4 security guards.
The reason they introduced ID badges for us is because some kids who I go to high school with look like fully grown adults with beards, mustaches(etc), and so the security guards would always mistake them for adults or people who weren’t supposed to be on campus and also the second reason for the badges is because over 2200 kids go to the high school and the number is continuing to grow.
The ID badges can be used to check out a book in the library, paying for your lunch, or used for identification. They also had the suicidal number hotline on the back of them.
Things you could not do with the ID badges(you could change the lanyard though)1:we couldn’t have anything on the badge that includes stickers, writing, or anything covering your face. We also had a colorful border around our picture to indicate if we were a senior, junior(etc).
2:The reason for the guards was because they could constantly keep watch over the students, faculty and guests. 
There was also this one guard who had the job of making sure every classroom door was locked from the outside. Every time a new class period started and the bell rang he would go walking around the school making sure every classroom door was locked from outside. If it wasn’t he would pop in and say hey please close your door and make sure it’s locked. The other 3 would patrol the hallways.",ILikeRibs970,3,1,1.0

341,Generally what happens between prom and graduation?,10vljgw,"Ok so for context, I am a high school senior graduating in about 5 months. We’ve already gotten a confirmation on the dates for both the prom and the graduation. The prom is on June 3rd and graduation is June 7th. From what I’ve seen, many schools have their prom pretty early into May so they can take their finals afterwards and then graduate. My school does finals first, and also we’re one of those schools where the seniors start summer early so in general our finals take place around May and then the Prom and Graduation happen pretty close to each other in the first week of June. I guess it depends on the school but once you have all your finals cleared out, Is there really a point in attending school once Prom is over? I mean you have all your credits, your final grades are in, you have college or military enlistment secured by now, and you’ve gotten past the prom. Now all that’s left is for you to show up at the graduation and get your diploma. So what even is the point of showing up to school in those few days? Like when I was a junior, I took a few classes with some seniors and on the last week after prom before their graduation, none of them showed up to school. Pretty sure their graduation took place on a Saturday, so the last time I technically saw them in person was the week before prom. Idk, I’m on my last semester where grades for college applications technically don’t even count so the senioritis has been hitting me pretty hard. I’m working hard enough to get good grades cause I still need to pass my credits to graduate but its not like I’m gonna loose my head just cause theres a C amongst the A’s and B’s like I did with the previous semesters.

343,I wasn't a great high school and still got a full ride at a Top 30 Univ,10vfhvk,"I regretted that I hadn't been a more involved high school student. I wasn't top 10% and had no real extracurricular.

If you're freaking out because (like me) you realized super late how college admissions work, starting at a cheap community college can “wipe your slate” clean. I became a super competitive community college student and still got over $200,000 in scholarships and into [Yale](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/yale-university/566) for my masters!

Despite being a CC transfer student, I was still able to base my entire college strategy on getting into the universities that offer financial aid guarantees promises for your family’s income level (“full need met schools”. As long I got in sometime, I could graduate with a guaranteed mostly full ride.

Because of these promises, I knew my local university (University of Texas at El Paso, $8,000 a year) was more expensive than the $54,000+ universities that offer financial aid guarantees. Crazy that the top schools that charge $50,000+ a year have money to give students full scholarships - and those scholarships include dorm, daily meals, and study abroad – making them a better deal for me.

**I was super motivated because these financial aid promises shifted my mindset**. I started thinking about my grades as guarantees for scholarship money. If I landed 5 As every semester for 3 semesters, I get the automatic scholarships. Every A, then, was like $10,000.

I drew up a plan to establish myself as competitive student in the four semesters before applying to top universities. Honestly, these 2-4 semesters could be your senior year + your 1st year at a community college/university, your 1st two years of community college/university, or your even last 2 years of high school.

The strategy I used: 1. Look for power vacuums or empty leadership positions to fill in school clubs or organizations like the student senate or debate club. Aim to hold two or three leadership positions. 2. Get great grades by doing school work daily (even weekends), and using Evernote/Anki flashcards for lecture and reading notes, use text-to-speech apps to turn your reading into audiobooks, and stuff like avoiding professors who give <10% of students As and turning in essays early for feedback, etc. Shift your mindset and pretend every A = $10,000. 3. Find unique volunteering in your community such as teaching ESL at churches, free tax preparation assistance for low-to-moderate income families, tutoring youths, or anything that uses your specific skills.

By doing this for three college semesters, I got into multiple $50,000+ schools with automatic full or nearly full scholarships.

I think others can copy this strategy too of transferring to a Top 25 to save money, though the financial aid guarantees only happen if their family makes under $70,000 a year, the median family income in the U.S.

Also, these top schools aren’t just the Ivy League schools. It also includes Oberlin College, Smiths College, UChicago, Occidental College where Obama went, the gorgeous University of Richmond where I went, Wesleyan University, George Washington Univ in Washington, DC, etc. These non-Ivy League schools have acceptance rates between 15-50%, much easier than the Harvard/Yale’s 4-6%.",catcatdogdog4,0,8,0.9

Bit of background, I’m autistic, in my last year at a small school (~50 people in the year now), and I’ve got no friends. I had some, but they’re really toxic (group A). after moving on from them, i started hanging out with group B, until i rejected a guy in the group and he spread a rumour that i said something sexual about my other friend, and they told all my friends. So i went back to group A.

Group A doesn’t like me because I did really well in this was assignment and they don’t think I deserved it.

For reference, the other classes I plan on taking will be Honors Spanish, Honors Precalculus, AP Lang, and Orchestra. I don't want to overload my schedule with a bunch of difficult classes, so I thought I'd ask. 

For science (picking one)

AP Biology - I hated honors bio

AP Computer Science Principles - I hate computer science

AP Chemistry - I love honors chem, it's pretty easy for me. However our school apparently doesn't go over one of the necessary units for this course, so I won't do good on the AP test. And I hate not doing good. 

AP Physics C - Heard it's super hard. Hated honors physical science (if there's any similarity)

AP Environmental Science - I definitely want to take this class because it's so easy, but I want to save it for my senior year so I don't have to try hard

For Social Studies (picking two!) 

AP US History - First time it's being offered at my school, so no previous knowledge of its difficulty. My favorite teacher ever (like I actually love her she's amazing) is teaching it. I am interested in taking it

AP World History - Really want to take this class. Two possible teachers teach this one, one of which is the APUSH teacher I love so much. I think I'd be disappointed if I got my schedule and I didn't get her as my teacher. 

AP European History - I want to take this. Heard it's hard though. 

IB World Religions - I want to take this. Plus, a great teacher teaches this, and he's retiring after next year. I don't want to risk not taking it next year, and then be stuck having an awful teacher for it my senior year.

356,grades.,10uxmib,"iii need help.  not in the way like school stuff.  well i guess kinda school related but not really. so.  im a kid who you'd consider pretty smart  (i'm not trying to brag or anything, it just is). however.  every. single. teacher says that 'wow, you have so much potential, if only you applied it.  for reference, i'm able to get 93+ in almost all of my classes with minimal effort. until now.  chem has been... different.  idk, it isn't HARD per se. i don't really like to use the term, but its been different.  to me, every single class has been, like, super easy, including chemistry. i can't achieve that perfection I want, but every single class that i'm in, no matter how hard or how easy, I manage to end up with the same overall grade- around 93,94, or 95  and my math teacher (literally amazing) explained it in a way that no one has before: I can get *concepts* super super super easily, but actually applying them/putting in practice and effort with them proves to be difficult, because I think i already know it and slack off/don't practice. however, i ended up in chem with a 81 first sem. first time ever ever ever getting a B. my parents are furious. like beyond furious.  again, i get the concepts in chem, but to me at least, chem is a lot more applying concepts than any other class...sooo yeah. i need a way to fix this. fast. I need to get a 100 average second semester for math(to qualify for a special program) and a 100 average in chem (so i don't ruin my gpa......)  
anyway, does *anyone* have a way to fix this?? literally anyone pls .  i have a tendency to waste time, i'm working on it  so that would be a great thing too  and also like motivation to do stuff lololol 

sorry if this makes no sense

its just

idek what to do anymore

bc ik i can be better in every single class- i just never put in the effort to do it

it's just so frustrating   
like people consider a 93 a good grade, don't get me wrong, but its not good enough because i KNOW my best is easily an A+ or better  
and i can get it.  
it's just that I'm not.  
perfectionism combined with disappointment and the fact that i know my best is far far better than this  


  
also- this is all combined with fear. I'm a first gen college applicant (from south Asia, parents know nothing, so i have to figure this out on my own). like, if i get a 85-89 average in chem this year, I'm kinda screwed, am I not??

360,Am I overeacting?,10uqfss,"
So, some backstory.
In my 6th hour, I sit next to my friend and his two other friends who are girls, and the other day one of them asked for my snap, and when I handed her my phone my friend said ""She likes you"" as a joke. 
The next day, we were talking (My friend, her and me) and I said one of her teachers were boring to me and she said 'I don't think we can be friends anymore' as a joke.

Now, I'm the type of person that thinks if a girl talks to me she doesn't like me, just wants to be my friend, but my friend is making me feel like she likes me, which is making me feeling like I have to do something. 
But sometimes when I snap her like just now she doesn't answer them and leaves me on open, which makes me think that she doesn't like me, and just wants to be friends.

362,How to Throw a Decent Graduation Party?,10unb4q,"I'm going to graduate from high school in a few months, and I just realized grad parties are a thing I need to be planning right now. I'm a first generation kid, and my parents are from a different culture where graduation isn't as heavily celebrated. Therefore though they have the means to pay for it, they have no idea and most of the planning will probably fall to me. First of all, I'm considering not having one. I'm an extremely socially anxious person who hates these kinds of events; I'm thinking by the grad party my social battery will be dead. I don't have that many friends, so aside from the few I have and a few teachers, the party will probably mostly be made up of my dad's work friends (we don't have that much family in this country so no extended family really), which makes it even worse. Second of all, with my parents already paying for college and goodness knows what else I need this year, I'm not too keen on spending a whole lot of money on one day. But I kind of have to have one; I come from a pretty small school, so everyone will know if I don't throw one. But I digress. So assuming I will be having one, what are the essentials I need for a grad party? And any ways to bring the cost down a bit (I'm considering designing and printing my own grad cards, but I don't want them to look stupid)?",purplepastelpangolin,11,6,0.84

So my plan was to take chemistry online during the summer to prepare, however my counselor said if I really wanted to, she might be able to waive the chem requirement for me. Also taking the class over the summer will cost $500. In addition to all of this, I'm also planning on doing 2 internships, while taking geometry online, so it might be a lot.

But the thing is, BSA has everything I'm looking for, and I've already been so invested in it. Distance wise Duke(30 mins) is better, but curriculum wise BSA is better for me(57 mins). He also says that Duke is recognized worldwide and BSA isn't, which doesn't really matter. What can I say to help him change his mind?

404,A guide to school buffoonery,10s0ntn,"I am bored so I decided to write this guide to some school buffoonery.

Please not that I am not condoning this in any way but if your gonna do it, might as well do it right! Also I am in Sweden so might be a bit different but should work other places too.

No More Calls home:

This is actually pretty simple! First make a new Email which looks like your parent/parents email so something like this:

[Jane-Doe@gmail.com](mailto:Jane-Doe@gmail.com)

And then get a friends phone number or a yours(doesn't really matter, although if bot your parents are registered in the school you will need 2 numbers and 2 mails)

Now just simply go to the person in control of these systems and say that your parents had to switch phone number and mail due to losing access or something, then give them the new mail and phone number.

Please note that if you are going to do both parents you should do them a few months/weeks apart so it is not suspicious.

Also make sure you are active in responding to these mails so they don't get suspicious!

Cheating on tests:

So me and my friends have a technique where we call each other before the test and use a small earbud connected to the phone. then walk in with it in your hand and put it in during the test.

Cough a little so your friend knows you are ready.

Now you can either whisper the question or if you give them a text beforehand they will read it to you.

1 tap with a pencil means wait

2 taps means re-read

3 taps means spell it out

4 taps means re-read the whole passage.

We usually do this for French tests and Spanish tests but it has also worked for science and math.

2nd method

If you and your friend has the same test before you, they write the questions down so you can use google to solve them and then you just memorize it or use the other technique.

Skipping school:

Either do the normal sick method or wait until thee halls are crowded and then walk out through a remote door and no one will suspect a thing.

Keeping your phone through out the day:

Just say that your phone is at home or give them a dummy phone :)

I was hoping at least 1 guy would type in the group, but no. No one said a thing. On the night before the presentation, I said in the group chat that we had to start this now, and if anyone can give any info whatsoever. No response for the entire night. Idk if they were sleeping or something, but no one gave a single response. The group chat was empty, so I decided to just start it. I worked my ass off and slept at like 4am, barely got sleep, and now when i begged them to start this morning, 1 guy sent like 3 sentences and thats it. I asked him to send more and he just wont budge.

Its so unfair man. I work my ass off, sacrificing my time and sleep, and stressing over my work, while they can just have things easy..? Just why? My mom even started to get concerned because of the late hours ive been staying up. I hate this man. Why do they not care? If I didnt send anything in the group chat and if I didnt ask anyone to start, they wouldve just taken the 0 and not care. Why do they just leave the work to someone else?

The presentation slaps, with really good animation and everything. Its the best presentation the teacher is ever gonna see, and I put my all into it. When I felt like sleeping, I stayed up.

Hangout with friends make relationships, all that stuff, and I’ve always wanted to go to the typical Hollywood high school because I thought id be interesting, 

But all that goes out the window, my new high school is massive, vertically, yes it’s very tall and it’s entirely technological based Eg. 

all homework/updates on school will be sent via a school assigned computer so always have to check that, and couple that with the fact that I’ve also recently moved houses and I feel overwhelmed. 

Expectations have all gone out the window, not to say I didn’t expect something to go wrong but this is way too much.

I also get home around 5 which I think is pretty late and I get really sad when I think about how much time I have left in the day, how little days I get for weekends/breaks, and how long I’ll have to do this for

I’ve always known that lots of people get depressed in high school but right now I’m not sure what I’m feeling,

Not many people in my middle school came to my high school, and so the poeple who did, stuck together. I still sit with my 'friends'/people i hardly knew from middle school. Truth be told - I don't see them as friends, just as people I sit with at lunch so that I don't look like a sad loner. A few of the people from our group spread out and made new friends, but everyone (exsept me) in that group are actually really good friends with eachother. I'm kind of an outsider in that group, even if no-one says it directly. Anyway, bottom-line is I want to make new friends. 

Here's where the popular part comes in. I go to an all girls school. The popular poeple gets friends, not boys. And if your not popular... well you have like a 20% chance of actually befriending anyone you want to be friends with. How you get popular in my school is down to a few steps: 

1. Look ok (don't have to be attractive, just not ugly) 

2. The most important is; Be social and loud

3. Have lots of friends

I wouldn't say I look too bad but I am quiet by nature and being loud and social scares me. Plus, it'll be so wierd if I just start being loud if I've been quiet the rest of the time. It's awkward. And even if it wasn't I'm just so scared that poeple will judge or think poorly of me that I could never do it. So advice? Tips? Anything? Please?

They're basically assignments I'm given while taking individual classes. For example, one is the Oral Communication PGR which requires me to (perfectly) present something in a class, such as English. They give us a PGR grading rubric and we literally have to get a perfect A+ or we completely fail the PGR. I failed that one for stuttering and will have to redo the entire project. And in order to graduate from my high school I have to complete every single PGR. They've given us about 15.

Some other PGRs include community service, surveys, and a fake resume.

Personally I think this is the most idiotic and unfair thing I've ever had to deal with in my entire school life, and it makes me feel like I'm living in a bad dream where nothing makes sense.

448,I don’t really care about anyone besides my friends and I’m starting to feel like a douche,10puf9q,"Graduation is so close yet so far away. I don’t hate my high school or anyone in it, I’m just so bored of school life and now that I’m so close to leaving it’s extra prominent. I was never bullied in high school and I’ve had the same friends since sophomore year. I’m also more introverted so I never went to parties or school gatherings or anything, I really just minded my own business and focused on my studies and extracurriculars. 

Since August my friends have been all over me to go to football games, participate in senior activities, yada yada, because it’s “our last year of high school”. I kept telling them that’s the stupidest thing I have ever heard and all I want is to get out of the crummy place. To make the story short, they continually talk about how it’s weird that they’re graduating and how they’re gonna miss everyone and stuff. All pretty normal stuff, I’ll acknowledge that. I’ve hit my true senior slump though. I only dress in sweat, have headphones in the whole day, barley talk to anyone, just doing what I need to do to graduate.

During lunch two weeks ago we were talking about the senior party that takes place the night of graduation run by the school. It’s $150 and I mentioned how I wasn’t going to pay that much to go to a poorly organized event (school has a history of horrible planning). Especially since I don’t really like anyone enough to want to party with them. My friends sort of agreed, but added the emotional part. One of them said how they feel the same way, but there are some people who she wants to see “one last time” and how the party is like a “final goodbye”. I told her that’s where we’re different, because while there are a lot of people I enjoy being around who aren’t per-say my friends. I’ve got assigned seating in math, my band mates, my teammates. Yes, I like all of them. But I don’t need a final moment with any of them, as much as they are great people, if I disappeared today without saying goodbye I wouldn’t care. I poked fun at my friend calling her emotional, and she shrugged and said she is. She poked some more fun at me saying it’s probably my bipolar disorder speaking.

I’ve been thinking about that conversation a lot. I begin to feel like a bad person for not liking my class, it’s not like they’ve done anything for me to dislike them. I’d actually say “dislike” is a lack of a better word, the feeling is more careless. I don’t hold a close relationship to them so why miss them. I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder my sophomore year, I don’t really discuss it a lot but my friends are aware of my struggles. One of the things I really struggled with was creating emotional bonds with people. It really makes me wonder wether that makes me incapable of feeling a connection to the other people in my class even without spilling my personality to them. Most people I talked to outside of my friends share the same sentiment as them. Really makes me feel like the odd one out for being so careless.

I feel like it could be strange too because I’m not going to college out of state. I’m staying where I am because I have waived tuition by the government. Funny enough my dream school is actually a pretty prestigious school in my city. So people say I shouldn’t burn any bridges, but I’m not burning bridges. I’m just not walking on them either. Some people wonder if I’m excited to get away from my family, no, I have no opinion. My family is great, i’m not clinging onto staying home but I’m not excited to leave them neither.

Any other seniors feel this way? No hatred towards high school, but no attachment to it either. Just excited to start somewhere fresh. This is all just a normal progression of life. I’m just taking it as is.",CartoonistSevere4348,2,0,0.5

453,How to cope with judge-y peers?,10pmnlu,"Hello! I’m a freshman in high school and I go to the top ranked public high school in the US, so naturally, I’m surrounded by a ton of fellow overachievers all the time. Lately, I’ve been struggling to cope with the prejudices of my peers. For some explanation: the student environment at my school is notoriously toxic and if you don’t follow the path that everybody else is taking (i.e. a ton of APs, advanced math courses, summer courses, etc.), you will be put down by your peers, often in subtle but extremely passive aggressive ways. I’ve been experiencing this lately regarding the math course that I am taking. At this school, if you didn’t take geometry before you began your freshman year, you are considered “dumb” and “behind” (I use quotations because these are things my supposed friends have told me or have said about their friends in front of me). All of my peers are taking algebra 2 or pre-calculus, so I feel like the odd one out. Not to mention, all of the geometry classes are very small, adding to that sense of growing shame within me. I could have taken geometry before 9th grade, but I was occupied during the summer before this school year with a music camp, and I was never pushed to take higher level math courses in middle school since I was always told by my parents that I just “don’t have a math brain.” I want to blame my lack of academic advising (I’m one of the few kids within my peer group who didn’t have a prep-academy to prepare me for this school, as you have to apply to attend, and I’ve never had any academic/college advisors as a few of my friends have) but I’m inclined to blame myself for my lack of planning and foresight. It’s not like I will not graduate if I take geometry in my freshman year, but it’s extremely socially unacceptable in this school. To add to that, people (outside of this school and within it) generally tend to equate a lack of mathematical ability to a lack of intelligence and somehow my peers turned this ideology into “if you didn’t get ahead in your math courses before freshman year, you must just be stupid!” I apologize for the long post, but I would really like assistance with putting this situation into perspective. My parents have told me that these people’s judgements are just ways for them to feel better about themselves by putting others down and that all that matters is that you’re a good person, that you’re doing well in school in terms of your grades, and that all that matters is that you end up at a good college after high school (which, for me, is the ultimate goal for these next four years).

See the attached flyers for the groups available this semester. Some of the groups are specific to a local area, but the majority are online. Therefore, they're available to any high school student, regardless of location! The program has already begun as of today, but we're still accepting students. This is a great opportunity to explore subjects one may not study in high school or dive deeper into school subjects one enjoys. The student application can be accessed through the Special Topics website or the links provided in the flyers.

465,Chemistry isn’t right for me but I am forced to study it,10p3w83,"Now what do I mean by “forced to study it”? Well here’s what. My school offers 2 kinds of specialties in high school. First one is accounting and the second one is chemistry. If I had a choice I would pick accounting of course, almost everyone agrees that I’d do better in accounting than in chemistry. Technically I wouldn’t do that well in neither of them because I am not a math person. I am really bad at math. But even students that aren’t good at math say that accounting isn’t difficult for them, after all from what I know all math you use in accounting is arithmetics and percentages and I don’t think that would challenge me. They study general theory of accounting, 10 finger typing, business communications, work on a computer etc. I personally think that this would be easier for me than chemistry. It’s too late to move to the other group (my class is split in two groups with half being chemists and the other half being accountants) because I have already started my education in this particular field of study. At one point I was so angry that I wanted to talk to the principal so she can move me to the other group. But I believe it’s too late now. Last year was my last chance to switch specialties. No one has switched specialties but even if it is possible it’s too late for me. I can’t even move schools unless it’s emergency. I am stuck with chemistry. I wouldn’t say it’s something super hard that I constantly fail but even though I try to study I still feel like I’m not good enough. I constantly feel insecure that I don’t know enough and that I’m not good at it. Our subjects include inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry and there are 2 types of the inorganic chemistry. (As you can see the accountants’ classes are more diverse than ours even though both groups get the same amount of special classes). I kinda lied to myself that I like organic chemistry because I kind of liked it, but honestly it’s not for me and no type of chemistry is for me for that matter. Although I’m sure it’s too late to do something about it I might still talk to the principal about moving me, there’s a small chance it could work. Besides I really dislike studying with 2 of my classmates that are in our group, they treat those with worse academic abilities like subhumans and they are those typical teacher’s pets. Anyways idk what to do. My cousin is also in our group and he’s struggling so bad with chemistry. I guess it runs in the family lol, but seriously I don’t know what to do for real.",Stelka7,0,2,1.0

I'm originally born in Campos dos Goytacazes, Brazil, but came to the US when I was 9 yo. I did almost all my education here and now I'm going for my senior year. I have a shitty gpa and probably I won't be admitted in any good college or university here.

Like I said though, I was born in Brazil. I have no idea how college in Brazil works, but I did a research and in Brazil they don't use gpa and there are some well ranked universities there.

Here the best I can achieve (with my limited budget and grades) is University of Colorado Colorado Springs #1926 in World Ranking and Brazil could offer a opportunity in UFES (#1242) and UFRJ (#360).

472,What should a Senior do to fill spare time now that business is done?,10oor9y," 

Im at a point ive never been in 2 years. Lots and lots of free time.

Since like mid junior year, I've been crammed morning to night with work. Dozens of college applications, 4-5 AP classes, programming projects, etc. Id wake up at 6am, finish workin at 10pm, then watch a movie or tv show for 2 hours till midnight. Sometimes 3 hours.

I considered that 3 hours normal.

But now, Im done with work pretty much. College apps are done, projects are done, everything is open. My 4 AP classes? Pretty much no homework ever, since I always get it done in school.

So now I finish school at 2:30pm, and have from 2:30 to 12:30 at night to do whatever. Only issue, I have no idea how to spend that time. 3 hours I can spend watching tv and movies no problem. Thats all good. But then I have 7 spare hours. 1 of those hours I can spend playing video game. 1 of those hours I can watch stand up comedy on youtube. One of those hours I walk/spend time with my dog.

That still leaves...3 full hours that ill be doing absolutely nothing. I cant cram more video games since thats just painful, movies and shows: Ive literally watch all in existence, i can only rewatch for 3 hours, more than that is painful. My dog, she's old so she sleeps mostly, the one hour is enough. Stand up comedy, even comedy gets painful.

So, 3 hours. How do I spend that? Given that I have no close friends I spend time outside of school with.

So it’s been a while but I for some reason started wondering if everyone else was going to high school everyday with a similar perspective as me. Every day I was worrying about what everyone else thought about me. School was easy for me as far as the schoolwork went, but I would have days that were so bad all because I was so concerned with being accepted and liked. Anytime I would have a friend I would wonder when they will disappear and I’ll be alone again. I felt like I was always the last person in the friend group. My friends would always do things without me and it constantly made me question if they liked me at all. I never felt truly welcome at parties and events. Idk it seems like I have a very negative view and perspective of everything that would happen.

&#x200B;

one thing I would tell my younger self to think of before high school and during high school

make a plan on how you can avoid any form of blunt impact to the head

\-being punched in the head or your head hitting the floor

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

don't punch anybody, even if you were not the first person to throw a punch,

because you will likely get punched back

a guy punched one of my friends/buddies at least 2 times in back of the head, my friend/buddy fell, combination of falling and being thrown down, his forehead hit the floor

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

not long after I punched someone else, who I didn't like, who I had past conflicts with in elementary school, I chose to punch him, because I treated them like the ring leader of the gang, I punched the wrong guy, not the guy who actually punched my friend/buddy

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I turn just in time to see the gym teachers notice me after I threw the punch, the gym teachers starting to hurry over, i.e. give school punishment

&#x200B;

I was looking at the gym teachers,

I got punched really hard in the jaw,

I did not even see who hit me

at the time I assumed it was the guy I punched,

but I can't be 100% sure who actually punched me

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

on a different occasion,

\-- one time, that maybe would not have been preventable in gym class, the teachers had every student line up on one side of the gym,

and start running from one side to the other,

naturally some students ran faster than others,

so it became groups of people running in opposite directions,

one big student, running right toward me, accidentally on purpose bumped into me,

the back of my head hit the gym floor, it felt like my head hit the floor before my feet

and the echo reverberated through the entire gym

and it hurt enough that I was crying,

it really hurt

probably a mild to moderate concussion

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

getting hit in the head, might have an effect on your academic performance,

and the slight brain damage might make you lose some memories

&#x200B;

I chose the Renaissance aspects of it, talking about how the characters represented stuff that I don’t remember anymore. Thing is I wanted to pass the test and move forward, so I didn’t really made a huge investigation about it. 

One thing though. I’ve always wrote my essays in a very “professional” way, using complex words and trying to sound as professional as possible, maybe to sound like a real professional instead of a high school student. 

Time passed and I finally got my grade, kind of a C+ (I got a 5 out of 7). The teacher calls me and asks about a website I never visited, saying that I cheated and literally copied straight from it. 
Absolutely surprised, I told her I never used that page to extract info, neither to copy paste. She also told me I used words that my peers never use so I might be copying from other sources. I ended up mad about it, knowing that I didn’t copy any of the sentences I wrote, but since I just wanted to approve, I let it go. 

final question is, Was the program wrong about it? can it be wrong? or is just a big coincidence that my sentence was similar to the one in the site? I remember trying to access to the website but since I was mad I just stopped trying.",DemienOF,7,13,0.79
488,Making money online as a teen in high school,10nvnab,"TLDR: My friends and I created a [non-profit platform](https://orena.org/) that teaches first-gen and low-income (FGLI) students how to make money and start an online side hustle completely for free. No hidden fees, no complexities. Just straight up teaching youths how to make money online.

Some context: I was an FGLI teen myself, and know what it's like not to have access to the resources and opportunities that others do. Plus - everyone can use some extra income, esp low-income teens. Some teens know that online side hustles exist out there, or they don't.

Even if teens know that they exist out there, it's hard to know where to start without having the right resources, since many courses are either scams or crazy expensive.

So we created something for free! It's called Orena HQ so that we can use the knowledge that we know now to teach FGLI kids the skills and tasks needed to generate income online. Also good for building skills that can be used in future jobs, volunteering and prep for college.

499,Should I Transfer Back?,10n9z09,"
I (16F) have transferred to an art school from a public high school this year. My previous year of highschool, aka freshman year was stressful, but I had a great group of friends to help me out. I had been on the tennis team and I was liked by all of my teachers. I loved where I was at, and I wouldn't have changed anything about it. But when I found out that I had gotten accepted into the art school I applied for on a whim, my parents encouraged me to transfer and so I did. Now, I am at a school where I don't have a fun and exciting friend group, and basically having FOMO as all my friends at my other school are starting clubs, going to tennis competitions, and studying together. I know that making friends will be hard and take a long time, but I'm worried that I will have missed out on high school fun and connections before I get there. On the other hand, I have really loved the extracurriculars this art school offers, I just have no one to experience it with. 
TLDR: Should I stay in an art school where I have no friends but good extracurriculars, or transfer back to my old school where my friends can support me?

502,I hate my teacher,10n5doi,"I hate my teacher. I really do. I had her sister as my math teacher last semester and no problems. In fact she is one of my favorite teachers. Yet her sister is a jerk.

I thought I would’ve liked her because she humbles people, but not anymore. In fact someone needs to humble her. She acts likes she knows anything and everything. She also gets mad and irritated over the simplest of stuff. 

Like it feels like you have to walk on eggshells around her. (Idk if I used that right) I also thought I would’ve liked her because I told her on one of those “get to know you” google forms that I have social anxiety and social situations are hard for me. She said it was a tough disorder and she feels for me yet what she did to me a few days ago said otherwise. 

It was the day I returned to school after I had been out on the previous day for that class and I sat down in the desk. I saw everyone get out a worksheet from yesterday or whenever. I was too afraid to go and ask the teacher because some kids were blocking her desk. So it was about 5 minutes in and I didn’t want people to think I was weird so I was on my phone (which Ik I shouldn’t have done). 

Then she came over and said, “are you working with a group or are you just on your phone” and like “do you think you can just be here and come on your phone” me confused and doesn’t know what to say, “uh oh yeah?” She smiled at me and handed me the worksheet and very firmly and harshly said, “don’t do it again” 

I nodded my head and my whole body burned. It was a strong combination of hurt, anger, and embarrassment. I told myself to remain calm. Tbh I felt like the victim and partly I was the victim (at least I think) yes, I shouldn’t have been on my phone but she took it the wrong way. Quite frankly she put words in my mouth. 

I didn’t mean to offend you or your “class rules” I don’t want to go to school and just be on my phone. I was just too scared to go up to her desk and ask for a paper. That was also no excuse for her to be that rude about it. She might’ve been doing it in an assertive way but she could have done it in a nicer way. 

A more gentle, less putting words in my mouth type of way. My old teacher (who is her sister) said to her that I was a “sweet baby angel” and  that I “would always be the one on my work” (which I normally am) so all of this doesn’t make sense why she would act like this towards me. I never done anything like this to her before. 

Sure you way think I’m overreacting but keep In mind I have social anxiety which makes social situations 100x harder for me. I take all social situations so seriously that it’s annoying and it’s hard to manage. 

This ruined my day and every time I think about it, it ruins my mood temporarily until I forget about it.

526,Should I transfer highschools?,10lnnms,"  I'll just be real, I don't have any sob story to tell. I don't get bullied often, (most) of my teachers are alright, the general layout of the school is okay, I just wanna go to a new school. 

I just wanna see fresh new faces and a new building, new scenery, ect. 

Sure I would be leaving my friends behind, but I can always call them, or we could meet up somewhere. I'm just desperate for some new scenery. I've been seeing pretty much the exact same people since 6th grade. I'm getting a little sick of it. I'm not particularly popular among my peers, most of whom are pretty hostile. I've learned overtime to stay out of harms way and nobody really bothers me. My friends are all pretty chill, I just feel like im gonna be stuck in a rut until I graduate with the same old friends. 

I have nothing against my current friends at all, I just want to be able to meet new people is all. I've told all my good friends that I may decide to transfer and they said it's okay and I should go for it. 

The school is in the next county over (only a couple extra minutes away from my house) so it's unlikely i'll meet anyone i've seen before. Everyone online also seemed to like the new school more than my current school, but everyone knows how online reviews can be.

I realize I'm taking a risk, and I have everything in place to transfer. I'm 95% sure I'm gonna transfer to this new highschool next year and end up graduating there. 

Could anyone who's gone through a similar process offer any advice? Any reasons why I shouldn't do this? Ty Reddit.",ydidicutmyhair,1,5,1.0

Is it risky to try a full dual schedule because I’ve never taken any AP classes and I know most people start dual enrolling their junior year with a couple of classes then switch to full dual their senior year but I didn’t do dual enrollment this year so I’m not sure. 

I know you’re probably asking why I’m doing dual enrollment if I’ve never taken any AP’S and honestly I’m mainly doing it because I hate my Highschool and I don’t want to be at school all day for my senior year. I saw that I had the qualifications for dual enrollment so I set up a meeting with my counselor so I can do it.I also plan to go to college for forensic toxicology which takes around 8 years so I need a head start tbh.

I’m mostly worried about a full dual schedule because I don’t know how hard college classes are and if I fail or decide to drop the class it will basically ruin my college GPA and Ill have to go to community college to get that GPA back up which is only gonna take more time. One of the qualifications for dual enrollment is to have above an 80 average in each of your classes and I have that but I struggled a lot to get my ELA and Science grades up above an 80 which is why I’m worried about dual enrolling those two classes because If I struggle with them in Highschool I don’t know how much I’m gonna struggle with them in college.",darwinwatermipoosay,3,1,0.67

I hate getting up at screw-this-o'clock in the morning, even when it's been /proven by multiple studies/ that teenagers' biological clock is not at optimal functioning at this time.

I hate how there are mathematically not enough hours in a day to do the amount of schoolwork assigned, participate in extracurriculars, and attend to personal needs AND get the necessary 9 hours sleep.

I hate that AP curricula expect us to be intellectually capable enough to absorb an absurd quantity of college-level material, but AP teachers don't consider their students mature enough to be treated like competent adults.

I hate how the College Board has a monopoly on education. I hate APs and I hate the SAT. I hate how these standardized tests are biased and how they set students up to fail, but that's all colleges seem to care about anyway.

I hate how no one seems to care about /why/ we're learning. The teachers, no matter how passionate they may be about their subject, are trained to teach the end goal of knowing the material well enough to muster an A on the final. There's nothing to teach us how to be a better learner, or now to be a better person, or heck, even how to file a tax return. Nothing of real meaning or use.

I hate how I don't care about school anymore. I hate that I used to love learning, but now I don't. School has squashed that passion within me. I don't study, I barely do my homework, and I don't care about my classes even when they teach something I'm actually interested in. I just can't find the motivation in me to care.

I hate how this is a system that works best when the students just BS and memorize their way through. I hate how even though I hate this ""lazy"" way out, I do it anyway.

I hate how students throw away their adolescence succumbing to the stress and anxiety of school. I've had panic attacks and depression and whole months where I felt where my life wasn't worth living because almost all of it was devoted to stressing about school. Because for some reason, getting anxiety is apparently a reasonable byproduct of getting A's.

If all goes according to plan, I have 127 days of high school left. I'm crossing all my fingers and toes and every other appendage in my body that my school will allow me to do my senior year at community college.

This year things may have just gotten worse- someone set the girls washroom on the 2nd floor on fire. I knew who did it and apparently they did it for fun. The vice principal had to fix it himself.

Finally the day of choosing a president came and i was expecting a vote or maybe the school office would just choose me for being the most hard-working student but sadly they chose someone else who isn't doing his job well. I asked the school office why did you and they said he is responsible, hard-working and everybody fears him. I argued what about the student why won't you let them chose and they said if more student complained we will

616,struggling to connect with AAPI students at my HS as black person,10ft3ob,"my middle school was mostly white people and as a black person i connected closely with the few POC there. and by few, i mean i could count them on one hand. my high school has an AAPI population over 50% so i was really excited to go because i felt like i would have more safety and solidarity. but in all honesty it has been much worse.

it feels like i need to learn so much about AAPI culture so survive but the efforts are never reciprocated to learn more about black culture (less than 1% of the population is black). i guess it makes sense why that would be, but it feels even more isolating. also, many AAPI students here only think i will get into a good college or do well in life because i am black/affirmative action, but i am working just as hard as everyone else. i am aware of the role AA has in college admissions and the asian penalty, which i feel very bad about, but i am just as smart as my peers. i know it will advantage me, but that doesn't take away from the accomplishments i have...

and, of course, the n-word and other racist comments follow me wherever i go, even from AAPI students here; AAPI students here will tell me about the comments their parents/other students make that are blatantly racist and i don't know how to respond because it does hurt to know that some of my friend's parents wouldn't accept me being black, and that many of my classmates will never take me seriously. i feel like i am not seen as a legitimate student just because i have different experiences from everyone. i know the stereotype is that AAPI students have strict parents, but African parents are also very strict and there's a lot of pressure on me to ""get out"" of the poverty and unfortunate statistics that black students succumb to.

when i try to tell my friends about how isolating it feels, it seems like they don't take me seriously. i try to explain how lonely it is as a black person at my school, and they think i'm just talking about racism in general, but really it hurts so much more to experience racism from other POC. it feels very isolating and i wish i had gone to another school with more black people because i feel like i'm missing out on that companionship and having black friends that i can share my culture with. i want to learn about AAPI culture, i really do, but i just wish my culture could also be appreciated here. does anyone else have this experience or any advice? should i start considering a HBCU for college? i tried to join my school's BSU but it was really disorganized and dominated by AAPI students and didn't seem that productive or helpful.  


edit: thank you to the people who have commented so far. despite what others may think (\*cough\*), i believe i am allowed to have some sense of community and connect with people inside and outside my culture. i don't think anything i said was unreasonable, nor did i have unreasonable expectations coming into this school -- i just wanted to be treated fairly. however, i have realized that considering how i am getting close to graduating, that i have many more chances ahead of me to meet people that i can feel connected with. i am going to try the BSU again and try to get by. i don't think i have tried to segregate myself, make things about race when they aren't, treat anyone with disrespect, or reduce people to their race. all i have done is have the audacity to what to be treated like i deserve to succeed as much as anyone else and have a sense of community... apparently some people would think this is wrong.",Clear_Key9642,13,7,1.0

623,"My 3 insane tips for future/current grade highschool students for better grades (no scam, no clickbait, working 2023, 100% free)",10fdnay,"**1. Understand your teacher's preferences**

Before starting an assignment, think about what your teacher prefers. Try to leave a good impression for the teacher at the beginning of the year. This can help you better understand his/her teaching style, and can help you in meeting the teacher's requirements.

Here are some things to ask yourself when doing assignments:

\- Does my teacher like quality? Or do they prefer quantity? Do they prefer a balance in both? 🌟

\- Does my teacher like complex work or simple, more straightforward work? 📃

\- What type of student does my teacher like? Do they like quiet students, or the ones that are more social? 📢

**2. Don't procrastinate**

Getting over the urge to procrastinate is hard, as most people struggle overcoming this bad habit. Even though it may be hard to control, you should try to practice getting rid of this urge as early as possible, since it may take a long time to overcome.

Practice writing the assignment as long as you have time, and try to hand it in as early as possible (preferably 2-3 days before the deadline). Do not ignore to work on the assignment, and try not to get yourself distracted by anything else. A good place that can help you focus is the library, so you should use this to your advantage as much as possible. 

[Don't be this guy](https://preview.redd.it/ikqdpq8z9uca1.png?width=455&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9e65a466f90b7ddd23ca6fe0155604415df8f8c3)

TLDR; Try to finish the assignment early, so you can enjoy the rest of your time off.

**3. Use rubric as a guide**

I think this one speaks for itself. 🗿

ALWAYS use a rubric as a guide when your doing your assignments. My friends and I lost way too much marks because we missed something on the rubric, so always check that your work meets all the requirements. Personally, I find it helpful to write a checklist of what I need to include. I recommend checking the rubric every so often when you're writing to make sure you're on the right track.

629,extremely suspicious and questionable coach,10ezg96,"hi. im a highschool athlete and my coach has been really weird.

to start off, i am on a varsity girls team and my team mostly consists of sophmores and freshmens. Many of us are young, especially the freshmens. they are short and small.

Starting from last month, the male coach (we have two coaches, one is a young lady and the one im talking about is a male highschool history teacher-- mid 30s) has been acting very ""sus"". he's a short, extrovertive and talkative guy, and he gives us a lot of advice. however, after almost every practice, he always tells these 2 specific freshmen girls (also the smallest and prob the youngests on the team) to stay back. I dont rlly know what happens with them but I think he talks to them and stuff. But the thing Im concerned about is how he is always bricked up during practice and always tries to find way to create contact with the 2 girls. you may be like ""y r u even staring down there"" but its so notciable (istg im not a pervert). an example of him ""seeking for contact"" is when during practice he tells someone doing their role perfectly fine to get off the court and he goes in instead of that person to ""demonstrate"" what is ""right"" which i think he does that to get contact with the freshmens cuz the sport i do is a high contact sport. he also forces high fives to the freshmens even though nothing rlly happened? 

im a tactful person and i have quick eyes. I understand what is going around me and i tend to notice other's emotions quickly. and within the past couple months, using my quick interpretive skills, I have concluded that something is rlly going on with that man. it is to the point where i am feeling uncomfortable even though Im not affected by what he does. He is a teacher at my school and rumors say that he got caught dating a senior a couple years ago and got banned coaching from that incident. i think the rumor is true cuz he suddenly stopped coaching for a couple years and hes a man rlly passionate about coaching.

636,English Advice for New Grade 9 Students!,10etwdm,"TL;DR: A lot of people seem to struggle with English as a subject. So this post is made with the intention of helping out; new grade 9s specifically. My main advice is to select the key points of your writing and leave out the filler. These skills are very useful both in and out of an academic context. You can use them for everything from resumes to essays. This will also become more important in the future as social media keeps continuing to shorten people’s attention spans.

With a new school year starting up and countless students making the transition from middle/elementary to secondary, I thought it would be a good idea to share some advice which I’ve accumulated through my own high school experiences. Specifically, advice about English.

I’ve noticed that many people tend to struggle with English as a subject, maybe more so than any other.  So this post aims to give some tips for new grade 9 students going into their first year of high school English. My post will specifically focus on a few, specific, individual aspects of how to succeed in English; but further discussion about other aspects is more than welcome in the comments.

The main focus of my advice for finding success in grade 9 English is learning the skill of selecting relevant points and keeping your work concise as a whole.

From my personal experience with grade 9 English, I can say confidently that being able to figure out which parts of something are important and what aren’t is a very valuable skill. I’ve had my personal ups and downs with this skill throughout my time in grade 9 English. However, I’d say that after all is said and done, I now have a better understanding of how to do it and why it’s so important.

If you are a person who’s struggling with compacting or making your work more concise, I’d recommend for you to review your work more. Each time you read through, really think about what each point or paragraph adds to the overall piece of work. I’ll also recommend you try your best not to fall down a rabbit hole or lose your train of thought too much. This can be hard to do as sometimes you just keep writing and writing but a good way to do this is to have a concrete plan before you actually start writing. That way you can really focus on your work’s main idea.

Being able to write concisely is also a skill that can be used without an academic context. If you have the skill of being able to compress large amounts of writing while still retaining the original points/meaning you can use that in many different ways. For example, resumes, applications as well as just general academic writing.

As social media gets bigger and (conversely) people’s attention spans get smaller, this skill will become even more important to know. People nowadays don’t have the tolerance to sit through long pieces of filler and just want the Sparknotes version of your writings so to say.

Thank you for taking the time to read through all this :) and I hope that someone found this useful and is able to implement these skills into their next project. As mentioned at the start further discussion is encouraged in the comments about other advice for grade 9s. If you have any questions leave them in the comments and I’ll try my best to reply as soon as I can.",ExperiencedGrade9,2,1,0.66
637,guidance counselors are not helpful,10ethdg,"my freshman year i took band because as a year long course it meant that i could fulfill my 5 art credits. i’m still happy with my decision, but the downside is that because i didn’t take a semester art course and a semester cs course that year, my cs requirement is still not completed. 

last year, i decided that i wanted to drop band in order to take 2 science classes: ap biology and honors chem. because i took two science classes instead of 1, there was no room in my schedule to take a cs course. 

last year before finalizing my schedule for this year, i met with my guidance counselor to ask if i could take my computer science class over the summer and transfer the credits and she told me my school wouldn’t accept that. 

the kicker is that someone else had the same idea as me and their counselor ENCOURAGED THEM to do it over the summer and helped them figure out how to apply the credits to this year. 

so now i’m a junior taking a freshman class when there was a clear solution but my guidance counselor just didn’t support me making that decision i guess????? because i also signed up to take contemporary fitness (a yoga class basically) for my pe class this year AND SHE DIDNT SIGN ME UP FOR ANY GYM CLASS UNTIL A WEEK INTO THE SCHOOL YEAR. so now i’m also taking a gym class that i didn’t want to which is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things but combined with the whole cs class thing i’m pissed.",Lopsided_Donut7986,3,1,0.67

644,Extracurricular Opportunity,10e1fki,"Young adults can learn more about cancer and receive various forms of support from The Tumornator, a student-run organization. Our goals are to stop the dissemination of false information about cancer and eradicate the stigma attached to the condition. Creating and distributing educational materials, hosting webinars, participating in virtual cancer walks, and engaging in fundraising campaigns, The Tumornator strives to ensure that young adults know the facts about cancer. 

We disseminate information about Cancer Kids First and create awareness in order to accomplish this through social media and blog posts. Through our workshops and posts, we make every effort to inform the public about cancer and the battle. By doing this, we hope to provide support and aid to those with cancer, as well as spread knowledge about the condition so that it can be better understood.  We are devoted to helping those who have been diagnosed with cancer and educating the public about the impact of this disease. With the support of social media, our website, and workshops, we can work together to create an atmosphere where cancer is no longer a death sentence.

The Tumornator's goal is to empower the community with knowledge and inspire individuals to become informed advocates for those affected by cancer. By adding new departments, like the tech department, and growing the writing department through the various platforms we can explore and develop as a team, we hope to increase the size of our team.  Additionally, we intend to offer workshops on cancer education to anyone who is interested, as well as podcasts and interviews with volunteers about their experiences in the near future. 

We're looking for passionate individuals who are committed to serving and educating the neighborhood. We believe that this collective effort will allow us to have a larger reach, helping to provide greater access to accurate information about cancer and allowing us to create meaningful conversations within the community.

It’s okay to fail.

I needed someone to tell me, so let me tell you. You have a 1.9 GPA? It’s okay. You have 100 absences? It’s OKAY.

The only time it’s not okay is when you genuinely have no subject you’re really good in. 

For example, I had many semesters where I had a 2.8ish. I hated attending school and it worsened my anxiety, sleep, and depression. But, when I was mentally okay, I was easily able to understand AP class subjects or learn 5 math lessons in 12h and score 100%. 

If you can’t do that at your okay, you need to try for yourself. 

I got a 4.0 in college straight out of HS, because the environment was better and so was the information I was learning. It made learning and becoming a better person actually feel worth attaining, which in return made school 1000x easier and less stressful. 

Talk to your parents, and let them know how you feel. Because at the end of the day, highschool grades don’t mean shit.

It's one of the courses I have next semester but I don't know if I should still take it. 

Personally, I do want to learn how to make music, I'm interested in editing and film production, but perhaps this course would not benefit me as much as I think it will? 

Do you think I'll benefit from it? Was it fun? How much was the workload? What do you do in the course overall?",jijaku,0,1,1.0
691,"Should I go to a highschool where my friends are going, or one which would be better for my future education?",10b7vyq,"Hi, I’m currently torn between two highschools to go to. All of my friends are going to one highschool with the AP program, but I’m not sure if I want to join them. I believe that IB would help me the most with my future education, but none of my friends are going to the IB highschool. I struggle with making friends and I really don’t want to be alone in highschool. Does anyone have any opinions on what highschool I should attend?  


Edit: Would universities/colleges in the UK really care if you did AP instead of IB",livinglaughin,21,8,0.91
