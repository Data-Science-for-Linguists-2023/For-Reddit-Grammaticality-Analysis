0,FAFSA/financial aid questions? Get help here!,pbs6uh,"**All questions about federal student aid, the FAFSA, and financial aid verification must be posted on this thread.**

If you want money for college, you should submit a [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) if you are eligible to do so. [Click here](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements) to review eligibility requirements.

2021-2022 school year: Use the 2021-2022 FAFSA, which opened October 1, 2020. Requires 2019 tax information.

2022-2023 school year: 2022-2023 FAFSA will became available October 1, 2021. Requires 2020 tax information.

**First time? Here's a step-by-step guide.**

* Create an [FSA account](https://www.fsaid.ed.gov) (also known as the FSA ID). This is your legal electronic signature to sign the FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well, assuming they have an SSN. If your parent already has their own FSA account, they must use that. If your parent does not have an SSN, they must print and sign the signature page manually, then mail it in.

* Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

* Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

Do not guess on the FAFSA. If you have a question, post here or [contact the Federal Student Aid Info Center](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact).",Laurasaur28,1912,821,1.0
1,How to deal with disruptive classmates?,11vsdw1,"I am in a 200 level Chemistry class right now. There is a student in the front row that raises their hand A LOT. The first few weeks I just ignored it, because I’m used to having at least one  “pick me” kid in class, but it’s gotten to the point now where they raise their hand for every little thing, and most of the time it’s just commentary, half formed questions, or questions unrelated to the lecture. It got bad enough that the last lecture my (overly nice and polite, midwestern) professor even got visibly frustrated and asked him to hold off on questions.

What is the proper way to deal with this if the professor won’t say anything to the student? I don’t feel like pulling them aside is really an effective way to communicate since I’m just another student and not a TA or anything, but it’s interrupting class and I’m trying to learn. I know I’m not the only one getting frustrated.",RevelScum,13,29,0.94
2,Parent won’t sign fafsa- what can I do?,11v9ry4,"Hey all. I didn’t find any answers in the fafsa thread for my specific situation and I’m really grasping for straws so I thought I’d make a post. 

Long story short, my mom and I have gone no contact and, to spite me, she adamantly refuses to sign my fafsa to the point where asking her to do it isn’t even an option. 

I don’t live with her (I live with my dad), but she’s claiming me as a dependent on her taxes and I don’t fit any of the criteria to qualify as an independent on taxes or as an independent student. I’m also 19 if that’s relevant.

Following some of the answers I’ve seen in response to other people on this sub, I looked into my school’s dependency override form and it’s a sticky situation. I fit the qualifications for it  (severe estrangement + substance abuse) but I’m also in the “not applicable” category because I’m considered dependent and I’m not living with her. 

Is it possible for my dad to sign it even though she’s claiming me, or is there nothing I can do? I apologize if this seems like a stupid question but having to pay out of pocket for my tuition is an absolute last-resort option.

EDIT: Thank you all for the advice! I will be meeting with an advisor from my school (in person) later this week to make sure no problems will arise if I use my dad’s information + signature on the fafsa. I’m also talking to him about contacting the IRS due to her illegally claiming me.",zee_st,102,394,0.99
3,I’m a college student who feels extremely lost and hopeless,11vqrea,"Hey guys,

So I am a college junior aged 22f. I should have graduated already. 

I am an art major. I love art, especially traditional, and I am really good at digital art, drawing, and painting. Like REALLY good. But I don’t feel like I fit in with my major at all.  Most of my friends are in STEM or business. I don’t really relate to the art students (they are very nice just not my vibe). I have no idea what I want my career to be. I just love drawing and painting. I’m not really passionate about anything else besides music and food but I can’t see myself majoring in those. I’d also probably flunk STEM as I’m horrible at math, and I’m not the best at studying. My grades are good but I can’t think of anything else I’d want to do besides art. I’m very lost .

When I was younger I was super extroverted, outgoing, passionate, etc… I loved partying, going out, and adventuring. But lately I have felt so lost and behind in life. I have become an extreme introvert since the start of this year. Being 21 was the best year of my life. 22 has put me in a quarter life crisis. I feel old and behind in life. (I’m in therapy btw) I used to hangout with everyone but now I rather go home every night and watch tv by myself. I only really hangout with my bf, best friend, and my parents. I never used to be this way. 

I won’t graduate until I’m almost 24, so I’m about a year and a half behind in classes. I still live at home with my parents. I moved out before but it’s just unaffordable where I live so I moved back in. I want my own place and to move out of my hometown. 

I have a long term relationship of 4 years now. I love him a lot and we see a future together but I almost feel stuck if that makes sense. 

I have a car and pay my own bills, but I’ve been a waitress for 3 years now and the money is decent but it’s incredibly depressing. I hate waitressing and it makes me feel less than other people. I just want to have a career and be on my next path in life but I feel stuck.

I want my motivation and drive back. I want to be able to make a living without serving tables. I want to gain my energy back and meet new people and live my life. 20s only last so long so I don’t want to waste it. Do you guys have any advice or has any of you been in this situation before?? I know i have depression, I started Lexapro 3 weeks ago so I’m hoping that helps. Let me know what you guys think .",ThrowRA890166890,3,7,0.89

5,"I’m considering going back to college, but I’m also worried about wasting money.",11vo2zc,"When I was in college a few years ago, I was the most lazy student imaginable. I prioritized the wrong things (I.e extracurriculars) and had bad habits (I.e my sleep schedule). I graduated with a political science degree I half a**ed. I luckily finished with no student loans though, so I have the option for a second go at school if I decide I want it.

The only thing is I’m hesitant to even consider going, until my bad habits have changed to the point where I think it might actually be different this time around. My bad sleep schedule, tendency to procrastinate etc. I don’t want to invest in school and realize what do you know? I’m making the same mistakes twice.

Until I fix myself, I feel like I deserve to work a low paid job in retail or hospitality.

6,Is Majoring in STEM Generally a Better Idea Than Humanities?,11vssom,I've been told I'll make more money and have better job prospects if I major in STEM. Is this generarlly the case?,Equal-Temporary-1326,11,3,0.8
7,Need advice about what language I should learn,11vuy29,"My university requires everyone to take a language, but I can't decide which one I should choose.

I am familiar with German and French because I took it throughout middle/high school, but I don't think I want to take those again. I am also fairly proficient in Japanese because of my background. At first, I was planning to take Japanese, just so I could get closer to some of my heritage. However, the more I think about it, I'm wondering whether it would be better to learn a more ""useful"" language, especially given the nature of my major (which isn't very employable) and my career goals. For the future, I'm interested in pursuing law, in addition to potentially working for a government agency like the FBI, CIA, etc. With this in mind, are there any languages that could benefit me more than others? I love languages in general, so I'd be open to learning a new one, as opposed to simply taking Japanese, German, or French just so I could potentially place out of some classes. My university offers many languages, so I can pretty much choose anything. I'd appreciate any advice or ideas.",__flowerrchild,6,2,1.0
8,My school requires me to do an internship to graduate and I can’t afford to.,11vlvmf,"I’m a senior pursuing my bachelor’s degree in Health Management (interchangeably Health Administration). My degree requires 200 hours of internship work to graduate. I was slated to graduate this spring (I’ve completed all of my other required credits), but obviously that isn’t going to happen unless I miraculously land an internship ASAP. 

I’ve been searching for the past 7 months and have applied to around 150 positions. Most of these positions have either been long shots or not closely related to my degree because, just to make this process even more complicated and frustrating, it’s been nearly impossible finding positions that *do* relate to my niche degree and meet all of my program’s internship requirements. So, I’ve been applying to literally everything and anything that I feel somewhat relates to my degree. This includes paid and unpaid, remote and onsite, and FT/PT positions. I have a 3.9 GPA, have had my resume looked over a million times, and have tailored it to each job I’ve applied to. Still nothing. 

At this point, I’ve had to halt the search and return to work full-time to support myself and my family (who’s low-income and needs all of the help they can get). Coincidentally, throughout this process, I was able to land an actual, real, full-time *job* related to my degree, which I start next week, but not an internship. 

I reached out to my academic advisor and sent her a candid email explaining my circumstances, reiterating that I’m very determined to graduate on time this year but am discouraged by how the internship search has gone, and asking her what my options are now that I’m going to have to start working again. She had absolutely nothing to say, and just advised me to contact my program director. 

I contacted him with the same email and he had even less to say. His response was extremely short. He simply asked what kind of organization I want to work in, then never responded after that. He completely ignored the rest of my email stating that I’ll be returning to full-time work next week out of necessity and that I cannot afford to *not* work anymore. 

Has anyone else ever been in this situation? It feels so unfair for this to be the *one* thing preventing me from graduating this year after spending the past four years working so hard, and the past seven months working even harder to land an internship. 

Any advice would be appreciated.",throwaway9289107,11,5,1.0
9,Parent of college student needs advice,11uque6,"Hoping I can get better advice from actual college students than I did from the parenting subreddit. My daughter is 20. She is a bit of an introvert and not interested in getting the typical college experience. Plus, I learned the hard way and don't want he tied to student loans. So she decided to stay home and go to a local community College. She works at a job that is in her field of interest and plans to eventually attend a local 4 year school and earn her degree. She's excited about her future plans and it's an obvious great fit for her.
However, she seems to lack the motivation to do the classes she needs to do in order to get to where she wants to go. She failed several classes last semester. She just didn't do the work. This semester, I am having to constantly ask if she needs to work on her courses (online this semester). I know she's doing well so far this time, but I feel it's only because I stay on her about it. She never needed this sort of prompting etc in high school.
Parenting subreddit told me to let her take time off school to ""find herself"" etc. That's not happening. I'm not supporting a 20 something year old while she does nothing around the house and does nothing toward her future. If you don't agree with me, that's fine. This isn't about my choices.

10,Is my dad holding me back?,11uoiuc,"So I just turned 18(male) and I am in college. I have 4 very good friends who don’t do drugs or anything crazy. I’ve never done drugs or gotten drunk before. My friends and I kind of split up after high school going our own separate paths. I wanted to start going to more social events like parties on campus or bars that kids from my school go to. My dad however has been very against this, claiming that I don’t need all that and I will be taken advantage of. I said I literally don’t do anything at home on weekends except dwell on social media. I understand him being worried/cautious, but also I want to see the real world too and I feel like I can’t be pampered my entire life.

11,Does anybody know if using a pen tablet with a pc is a good way of taking notes for class?,11vp2xe,"Just to give you some Insight that might help, I'm an engineering student. My main purpose from a pen tablet is just to take quick notes in class, draw graphs, vectors, write formulas and mark up any pdf file from the teacher. I normally just use a combination of my laptop to mark up slides and just pen and paper for anything else. I would buy a tablet with a stylus but I don't have that kind of money so my question is if I buy a pen tablet like a wacom One, would it be  an efficient way to taking notes cleanly? I really don't want something that needs a lot of tinkering just to write two words meaning that I can catch up to my lectures just fine. Also my university gives us office so I do have OneNote.

20,What’s wrong with me? Or is it the professor?,11vvcs3,"My class has been assigned an essay due tomorrow in which we are to respond to multiple prompts that ask us about OUR experiences in OUR organizations (a first person prompt). The problem is, the professor has mentioned countless times how we are NOT to write in first person unless explicitly stated in the prompt. It was not explicitly stated in this prompt. 

So I emailed the professor to explain that I was struggling with not writing about my own experiences in first person. She responded, and I quote, “I am aware that addressing the prompts may require students to write in first person.”

I was frustrated reading this response because it did not provide an answer for my concerns. I followed up by asking her if we were permitted to write in first person for this essay and she has yet to respond; probably because she thinks I’m giving her a hard time. My family and boyfriend corroborated this by saying she did answer the question and I’m like, no she didn’t? I still have no clear direction and I feel mentally paralyzed because I don’t actually know how to proceed.

 My line of thought is this:

Although it’s true that we MAY be allowed to do a thing, it is not necessarily true that we should do that thing. What we SHOULD do can only be determined by conditions that are explicitly stated. In this case, the conditions of what we SHOULD do have been left unspoken. And she has left it up to ambiguity. Which is wrong. She needs to EXPLICITLY state all acceptable options. She set a standard at the very beginning of the semester that I’m trying to follow.

21,Is emailing/calling an old professor for a LOR appropriate?,11vv2q3,"I would like to ask my professor from my prior university for one. The only thing is, I was in his class exactly one year ago, and I’m not sure he’ll remember me very well. After that semester, I transferred to a state college. It’s difficult here to get letter of recommendations considering I’m in class with 250+ students, so it’s somewhat difficult to form relationships with professors. I do have one who I intend to ask (which I’m super nervous for), however I obviously need more than one. 

What makes me want to ask this professor is that I worked incredibly hard in his class. I went for every extra credit opportunity, had good communication when it came to questions regarding the course, and I’d also go to tutoring every day after class, where he would also be to help students.

23,Issue with how a professor is teaching an online class,11vtygp,"Hi ya guys, so one of my professors I feel like is giving unreasonably high expectations in order to succeed in their class and I just need some advice or guidance on who I could talk about this. (At my college)

This is an online asynchronous lab class. I took the class this way as I’ve taken asynchronous classes in the past and loved them and I enjoy the flexibility they offer with my job. I haven’t had any issues with them in the past (I’ve taken like 8 total) until this class.

-Professor gives 4-6 hours weekly of lecture videos that is required to watch in order to succeed in the class.
-Labs require 4-8 page reports that take at least 2 hours weekly and don’t relate to that weeks material.
-All quizzes are closed note and require the use of lockdown browser.
-Class has 4 exams, all of which have to use a lockdown browser and be live proctored via zoom (or come in person to take), closed-note. 

I definitely feel like something is wrong with this especially for a async course, or do I just not have my expectations set high enough? Is it me? Is it the professor? I want to succeed in this class but I’ve never had expectations like this before. I’m committing upwards of 12 hours a week to one class and I’m taking two other classes. One of which is a lab class that teaches a subject just as hard as this one but has nowhere near these expectations to succeed and I only spend 3-4 hours on it a week.

The only academic field that I have ever been remotely interested in is psychology (took AP Psych as a sophomore). However, I didn't want to major in psych because about half the year I found the content boring. I was only ever really interested in the psychological disorder and social stuff. I find mental disorders really interesting and I also find crime stuff interesting too. I chose neuroscience as my major because I figured it would give me a very good understanding of the brain and our functions, so then later when I go to grad school I can then easily move to something in maybe forensics or research. 

All this being said, I have hated biology in high school. I have taken AP Physics C: mechanics and AP Chem, but never took AP bio. I also was not a huge fan of AP physics either. After reading a lot on my major and what classes I would take at UCLA, I realized just how biology/physics heavy it would be. I guess its my fault for not looking harder into it before choosing neuroscience. I also wanted to do something in STEM because I always here stories of people who majored in something art or history and never did anything with their degree. 

Any other passions/interests I have had I always discredited as an option for a career because it just seemed impractical. I find ancient history really interesting (loved learning abt egypt, greek, rome ect) and even though I'm not religious I find learning about religion very interesting. I also love movies and always always dreamed about being in movies/ making movies when I was younger, but never pursued it because it seemed so unrealistic.

(Community College, Level 200 course)
My educational psychology teacher had this project outlined in the syllabus and formally assigned it to us the 2nd week of class. Whichever topic we picked determined when we presented throughout the semester. Its a small class so I was assigned 1 partner and we were to present week 11 (27th - 31st).

We both agreed that we would do research and learn more about the topic in question and touch base each week at our Thursday class. He was also specifically instrcuted to find a video to add to the slides. Around week 5, I sent him a partial PowerPoint with about 6-7 slides done and indicated he could adjust and add info as necessary. I completed some more work and sent him a revised Powerpoint about 60-70% finished (around week 7) and notated where he could add the video. 

Right before Spring Break, I touched base with him in class and asked how it was going, and if he had read my emails. He said he hadnt read my emails or done any work becasue his computer was broken and it would take a few days to fix. Right then I knew that he hadnt put in any effort at all and I was essentially doing the project solo. We are supposed to meet this upcoming week after class to organize our presentstion which is due the following week. 

Do I talk to my professor about this and basically rat this kid out for not doing anything? 
Do I still meet up with him and just let him participate in the presentstion as best as he can?

43,To all those who didn’t have a good college experience.,11urkxh,"Hello all, I hope everyone is doing well. 

I’m just writing this because I have read various posts over the last few months, and years of many people who did not have a good college experience and wanted to chime in with my thoughts on the matter. 


First, I am not from the US, but I just wanted to say , to all those who did not have a good college experience, who were disappointed in the final outcome, or who didn’t make many friends, I am sorry it didn’t work out or the experience wasn’t what you hoped it would be. 

For what it’s worth, I think the typical college experience is something that has been promoted for years by holywood, the entertainment and media industry. It is promoted as this care free experience, endless parties, meeting the person of your dreams, discovering your inner self etc, etc. Well, unfortunately, that is simply not the case for many, and you rarely hear about these stories, and the struggles that so many have had to go through just to get an education. 


For my part, it was one of the loneliest experiences that I was glad to put behind. I did 4 years of an undergrad and 2 years of a part time masters. 

When I started off in my undergrad things weren’t too bad in terms of friendships. In the first and second semester i often went to some of the student restaurants and cafes 2 or 3 nights a week with some classmates, which was great in the beginning, I guess we didn’t have as much of a workload on our hands, but then as time went on I did notice people started to become more distant, and despite getting involved in various clubs and societies I found it quite difficult to meet new people, especially outside of lectures. For a start, one of the things I noticed from very early on is that most classmates tended to go home most weekends, rarely hung out after lectures, and the people that tended to join clubs and societies it appeared that many new each other already and did not socialize outside of their pre-established social circles. My course was probably one of the quietest courses, people hardly even spoke to each other in lectures or volunteered in tutorials, and I along with a mature student were frequently some of the very few that volunteered or answered questions. 

I never drank in college, but I never judged anyone for their habbits, to each their own, nevertheless, I noticed that an awful lot of social circles appeared to be just drinking buddies or shallow superficial friendships. 
I am visually impaired and it was a constant fight for academic support, year after  year after year. Every semester I went back it was like starting in first year all over again. During one of my years I had no academic support for 8 weeks of a 12 week semester, and after many fights with support services, I had no note taker until my final year of undergrad study. 

As well as that, I found that a lot of people didn’t really know what to make of a visually impaired person. “You’d be better off just hanging out with other disabled peers” were comments I had to deal with quite frequently, and “you’d be beter off just going for coffee with other visually impaired people because it’s too much responsibility”. Really, in this day and age? I couldn’t believe such attitudes still prevailed throughout society and the fact that people could even get away with such comments because I was never brought up like that and I know I would never have gotten away with it. 

In the end, my only real luck with friendships in my undergrad and masters came about when i attended various language exchange meetings, and when I attended an African music and dance workshop. In the language exchanges I met Spanish, Mexican, African and other exchange students. The only problem with these friendships, and although we kept in touch on social media is that many were only here for a semester and went back to their home countries after that, so often times it was back to square one again. 


In my masters, I’d say there was about 10 people in the course, many of which were older than me, I was one of the youngest in the course. I think I only saw them once outside of classes and that was it. As Much as I would have liked to have joined more clubs and societies, I simply didn’t have the time. I had to write 8 7000 word papers and a 15,000 word thesis. So all of that, combined with the fact I only had 4 contact hours per week, in addition to doing research for my various essays, presentations and thesis made it very difficult to meet new people, I even had to stop going to many of the language exchange meetings. 

The second summer of the masters was spent writing my thesis which took about 5 months to do. It was very difficult and i almost dropped out , but in the end I kept going and I eventually graduated with a first class honours. 


It quickly dawned on me after college that many people don’t keep in touch with college mates. Since finishing college I have pretty much lost all contact with college mates and aquaintances from both my undergrad and masters. Yet despite the blindness I have various hobbies: swimming, bowling, rock climbing, music production, and I even tried activities like skateboarding and surfing, and have various friends through language apps, whatsapp groups etc. 

Anyways, I hope this post will be of some use to some people, and if you get anything out of it, it’s that you are definitely not alone if your college experience wasn’t what you hoped it would be.",Positive_Bar8695,8,44,0.98

I thought it was a good film and a nice choice for my essay, but I'm worried it's too much.

49,Freshman Civil Engineering Student wanting to shift to Industrial Engineering,11vgij3,"I'm a Freshman Civil Engineering Student who wants to shift into Industrial Engineering. So for my background, I live in a 3rd world country so my options for CE are much less and I've just found IE to be interesting.

I've read about IE and it seems right about my alley and skills. Whereas in CE, I got into it because I probably exaggerated in my head how ""cool"" Civil engineering is. Where I thought Structural engineers are like outside all the time, etc. You get the point.

Here are my points for CE vs IE.

CE:
Pros:
- I get to go outside/not stare at a computer (which is probably less common in IE)
- I'm still kind of interested in the subfields, mainly transportation and structural
- Can own a construction firm

Cons:
- From the point above, I exaggerated it
- Live in a 3rd world country where CE has a much less demand, where going oberseas is the better option to gain more money.

IE:
Pros: 
- I'm also interested in the subject, can see myself in certain fields in IE
- People have said that it's versatile
- More opportunities in my country

Cons:
- Can't seem to find jobs where I can not stare at a computer
- Can't own own business? (correct me if I'm wrong)

However, I feel guilty because I don’t think they are anticipating me ‘fully’, both my strengths but also my disabilities. I have IBD, and was hospitalized for multiple months my Junior year. This condition made me also struggle for an eating disorder for multiple years, though luckily I recovered. Half of my hospitalization was chalked up to malnutrition (I became really afraid to eat before my treatment for IBD) but the other half was the inflammation. I am in remission but still have IBS and daily pain. 

I wrote about this in my college essay. In addition, I was an abuse victim and grew up in an addict family, and have developed pretty bad PTSD and insomnia, partially at night as that is when \*it happened\*. This was also in my essay and detailed in my portfolio, I don’t feel like I am pulling secrets. 

I have anxiety and OCD (diagnosed) but I dont know if that is very important to accommodations like what is prior stated. 

My senior year I have been fully remote because I was out of my home and in remission but needed to have that time as I couldn’t keep up with public school. Anyhow, I am excited to make the step to be active and on campus again now that I have learn ways to manage pain, my nutrition, etc, but I don’t think having roommates will be manageable. I don’t care if the room is unventilated, small, dingy, the wort one in the school In the worst area. Having one area as I rest where I feel safe and can do my care procedure is very important to me.

Having my therapist and doctor so far will already be a challenge, but I don’t want to give up on my education because of illness I did not choose.

I love the other CS class I'm in, but it is a discrete math class and is really more of a math class than CS. We just learn logic proofs, set theory, game theory, combinatorics, that sort of thing. I really enjoy that class.

But the next classes I have to take also sound boring as hell. I'm beginning to think I actually hate CS and I should do something else. But I have no idea what to do. I was angling myself towards a CS career for the past five years of my life. But I'm realizing now that CS itself isn't what interests me. It's what you can do with CS. What I actually like studying is science. i.e. physics, bio, astronomy, etc.

I'm taking a bio class right now, because I was thinking about doing something in computational biology-- and it's super interesting. I love learning the course material and on our last midterm I got the highest exam score. Because I actually can listen to what the professor is saying in class because it doesn't make me want to die.

But also, I'm interested in cybersecurity and machine learning and I'm worried that if I drop CS, I will regret it. I don't know what to do. There's also the fact I don't have a backup plan of a major to do. And I am absolutely not doing information science.",Logical_Farm_943,34,68,0.92
72,Dentistry vs cs,11v4lji,"Since I was a kid, my dream has been to pursue a BSc in Computer Science. I like the field and that you are the future, and most people are trying to learn what you are doing. But when I started working on this dream and got enrolled at the University, I regretted it. The Uni isn't good at all, and I can't transfer credits from it, and the lecturers aren't good at all; they can't explain any shit.

I have talked with a lot of people, and it made me more lost, so I have these three options:

First is to return to Egypt as my friends tell me the University is better and the lecturers are much better.

The second is to complete my degree in this shitty University and then depend on Harvard and MIT free courses to build my skills.

The Third is to return to Egypt but retake my SAT I AND II and enrol on dental school. So, I will change the whole degree because I need help; maybe I don't Like Computer Science IDK anymore.

The benefits of staying here are that I will finish in two years only, so I will start my life early. If I returned to Egypt, I would need to do a whole 4 years. Or if I moved to dental school, I would need to do the whole 8 years.

74,Advice on Major Choice,11v2hlv,"Hello,

Since last fall I have been attending community college to earn an associate's degree with the general intent of transferring to a 4-year school for business. However, since the start of the spring semester, I have been having second doubts about what precisely I wanted to major in whether it is accounting or supply chain as I have primarily been focused on finishing general education courses such as business calc, science, to English. Initially, I wanted to pursue something creative such as graphic design but felt deterred from choosing it as I was encouraged to instead pursue something related to STEM. (I also had an interest in computer science but did not see myself going through it because of courses that I did before entering college that didn't really capture my interests.) I also went to career services at my college earlier in the semester to be able to talk about my circumstances but was unable to really find the feedback, support I needed. This is only halfway through my first year at college and I am quickly feeling just self-doubt about whether or not the path I am choosing for my intended major choice is the most well-suited for me to follow. Has anyone gone through this before and how were you able to go through it?",Tluis5312,5,0,0.5
75,"Should I stay in IT career field, or quit my job and take out loans to attend Physical Therapy School?",11uh32q,"Originally, I went to school for kinesiology. Couldn't find any jobs in that field, so I became a firefighter for a few years then I changed careers to IT got certs and worked my way up from help desk to system admin. Currently, I'm in early 30s, making 55k for university pension, pto, and tuition benefits. I've had offers for more at times in IT for 70-105k, but nothing has gone through all the way yet. 

Part of why I changed to IT was better career progression, less hours, higher salaries for less student loan debt, and more job opportunities. Whereas, IT you can apply to system admin, network admin, help desk, cloud, devops, analyst, etc. Whereas, with PT your stuck with just PT and you can only apply in the states you have licenses in. 

Also, while the salaries for PT are ok at 70 to 100k, The loans would be 70-80k that I would have to pay back. Plus I would have to attend school full time for 3 years, and not work, so I would be missing out on $150k in income.

I have had one person suggest that I don't want to regretting my life because I never did what I wanted to do.  And that I don't want to be 70 with a fat retirement account and have the thought that I wasted my life.   


However, healthcare does have long hours, strict licensing and med school requirements. I may have to go back and retake classes from bachelors if they timed out or I missed prereqs. Do extra volunteer hours and essays/references, to qualify for PT school. On top of that moving back in with family for 3 years and missing the work experience and income.

The other option is I could use the free tuition at the school to get a masters in IT or mba, and come out potentially making more than a PT, while making money working and getting the tuition assistance. Plus I've already interviewed for jobs that already pay around what a PT makes without all the debt. 

What do you all think is the more logical choice financially and life wise? Stay in IT or go to PT school?",ElectricOne55,33,8,0.83

77,How to get the most out of college.,11tv2oa,"Firstly,  don't go to college looking to get a degree. This will set you apart from 90% of your peers. You are going to college to give your career a future. Period. Change the mindset from a degree to a career. What job do you plan on getting with that degree? Look up on indeed.com or something similar for job requirements and 1 out of 10 will be the degree. Everyone else applying will have that degree. While you are in school, focus on learning and excelling at thé other 9! Guaranteed you will be far ahead of everyone when you graduate. 

I have interviewed hundreds of people, including from top universities like Stanford or Duke and they know practically nothing. 

Secondly, use the opportunity to expand your skills. Take some art or music classes, an outdoor wilderness course if they have one, involve yourself in some clubs and organizations, go to the school performances for symphonies, plays, etc.... you will never get such an amazing opportunity to grow. 

Lastly, stay away from hanging out with people who aren't serious about their future. You become who you hang around. Find the people who are really driven to find joy and success in life and become friends with them.

99,Wanting to Switch my major from Computer Science to Accounting. Help.,11udlpc,"Hello everyone. This has been on my mind for a while, and I am really in need of advice.

To make a long story short, I’m a Computer Science major and I’m currently miserable. I got my Associate’s in CS and then transferred to a state university where, obviously, am majoring in CS, and it’s been awful. I’ve failed all my programming classes and am currently retaking a couple this semester for the 3rd time. Things got so bad that I was on academic suspension last semester. Thankfully, in one of them, things are going well. However, in the other class, it’s still awful. I’ve been going to office hours and tutoring, as well as asking for help from my peers in class, but it still isn’t clicking.

Over the last couple of weeks especially, I am really wanting to change my major. The major that has been on my mind to switch to has been Accounting (one of my siblings is an Accounting and Finance double major and they are doing extremely well.) It’s something that I only recently gave thought to, so I haven’t yet talked to my advisor about it or reached out to someone in the Accounting major department (although I absolutely plan on it this upcoming week.) In the meantime, I have been looking at the curriculum for my university’s Accounting major as well as looking up other resources about the field, what work is required, what the starting salary is, etc.. It has really piqued my interest.

I mentioned to the Double Major sibling about my interest and how I was considering the switch and they shot me down. I was told that Computer Science was easier than Accounting and that they wish they would’ve studied Computer Science. That if my best effort was still failing, then I need to just drop out of college because “every major is like this. If you can’t handle the work, then you can’t do it.” My family all take the stance of “if everyone else in class can do it, why not you?”

So, this is where I am. I have a little over a week until my university’s deadline to withdraw from my classes with a W, and I am stuck. My family all believe I should stick it out in the class I’m struggling and that my issue is that I’m not working as hard as I should and that I need to basically disconnect from everything but school. But I feel hopeless on my current path. If I can’t pass these classes, what am I gonna do if I take more advanced classes? Or in the workforce? For as much as I love computers, this major is not what I thought I could do. I feel burned out and if I don’t pass this class, I could face another academic suspension, which would last for 2 semesters (aka the entirety of the next school year.) I am desperately wanting to avoid it.

What should I do? I want to switch but how should I proceed? The classes I’m taking won’t benefit me if I switch so should I just drop all of them? How do I convince my family that Accounting is easier than Computer Science and that I would be able to handle it?

Thanks for any advice. I’ll take anything and everything on board.

Our school isn’t close to home, it’s a few hours away and I’m struggling on deciding if I want to room with her or find someone else. She is SET on rooming with me. We are still pretty close friends but not like we used to be. My hesitation is the fact that she hangs out with people I don’t align with. She smokes, parties, and doesn’t exactly prioritize school and kind of relies on me in this one class we have together. I just don’t know if i want to live with her through college but I’m also nervous I’ll regret it. She’s also a great study buddy and i love her. Please help!

UPDATE: 
She really pissed me off this morning and I told her. “I can’t live with you in college” her response was I don’t really care anymore. I want to live with someone who “has fun”
Kinda hurtful because I’m not a boring person. I go to parties lol and I hangout with my friends but not until my work is done.

Unfortunately, living with my parents has been very rocky and it’s getting worse by the day. I won’t delve too much into the situation (reports to CPS, suicide attempts, blah blah blah) but I really just want to get out of here as soon as possible.

Anyways, my parents are currently not helping pay for my tuition. They promised the kids (I have two older siblings) that they had a college fund set aside for each of us. They gave my brother and sister a lot of money (not sure how much exactly, but in the thousands) as well as completing the FAFSA for them to assist them further.

Unfortunately, my parents refuse to fill out the FAFSA for me. They are… how should I word this… anti-government?? They are against giving the government their information for some reason, even though they did it for my brother and sister (and they still do their taxes lmao). And no, I cannot change their minds. I already tried to no avail. I was recently offered a student aide position at my current school. For students working on campus their tuition is cut by almost half. I couldn’t take the job because my parents refused to fill out the FAFSA, which was required in the final paperwork by my college in order to work there.

I’ve worked part-time since I was a freshman in high school. My first year of community college was just under $12,000 (without the FAFSA. So much for being cheaper). I spent all of my life savings on my first year here. I literally only have a few hundred dollars left in my bank account.

When I mentioned I was thinking about transferring one year early, my mother said she and my father will not financially support me at all anymore. Meaning, they will take the money out of my college fund and, I don’t know, go on vacation with the money or something. They don’t want me being “brainwashed” by the professors at university and instead want to be able to watch me at home so I don’t turn into a liberal LOL (you probably understand why I want to leave now).

I really need some advice on what I can do. I desperately want to leave, but I have barely any money. I work a minimum wage job about 10-15 hours a week, because my hours were recently cut. And no, I cannot get a new job, because my family only owns one car and my mom refuses to let me drive it and she refuses to drive me further than a mile to my job, because she says it is wasting her time :/

Thank you for taking the time to read!

Edit: Yup. You read it right: $12,000. The community college I am attending is technically in the county next to the one I live in, so I am paying out-of-district tuition. Why? My parents forced me to since it is supposedly “better” than the one near me.",bjajax,18,6,0.88

1. How does paying for college work?? One thing I’m afraid of is not being able to pay for college, even with scholarships, financial aid, and taking out a loan. I’m going to be staying in a dorm, which is $3000 ish per semester, and I’m super afraid of not being able to afford it. I’ve talked to a teacher about this and she said it’ll be included in my tuition. How do you pay for tuition?  
For a bachelors, do you pay for all four years upfront or pay per year?
If you do pay per year, do you also pay upfront or is there something for you to pay monthly?

2. How does fafsa work?

3. How much would you typically take out for a student loan? Again, cost is a thing I’m afraid of and I’m afraid of not being able to pay it off.

4. How does paying off a student loan work? I’ve also talked to one of my teachers about this and she mentioned something about interest. I would like to learn more in depth about this.

5. What was it like for you being a freshman? My college won’t be too far from my home town and my friends will only be 25 minutes away. I don’t wanna be alone and not knowing anyone, so please tell me your experiences.

I am a junior in college and retook Organic Chemistry but I got the same grade, which was a C. I am on the Pre- PA track so I am asking to see how this would hinder me when it comes to apply to graduate school? 

While retaking the course I spoke with my professor and he told me to withdrawal from the class and, in my case, it is best to give up because it’s worse to retake a class and get the same grade instead of withdrawing. Also he said that it would just show where I academically plateau which wouldn’t be a good look for me but I didn’t excel the second time. I guess I should have listened but I stayed in the course to be better and I had faith in myself to at least get a C+ but that didn’t happen. 

When it comes to science and math classes, I do not excel even when I study or go to tutoring, so for most of the science classes I have taken I have gotten a C. My GPA currently is a 3.2 so I would only imagine my science GPA is much less. Last semester, I took Anatomy for the first time while I retook Orgo and I got a C- so I have to retake that. Does retaking multiple classes look bad on applications too? Even though, I don’t necessarily excel academically, I do when it comes to community service and healthcare exposure. Would these things be in my favor enough for me to be considered?

With my grades, is it even possible to be accepted? I want to be a PA but I also need to be realistic about the possibility of that.

149,Being forced to pay for classes I've never attended,11tbl0s,"Not sure who to talk to about this but I've been going back in forth with a college because a collection agency keeps calling me about paying for a classes I have never attended back in 2018.

In 2018 I joined the Navy and went off to bootcamp, I am still active duty and rarely ever go back home. The college says I registered for four classes and did not attend two of them and got grades in the other two. Not sure how I received grades for classes I have never attended. I have never even set foot in the college. Tried talking with the agency and apparently its my fault for not knowing about the payments till recently this year after I returned back to the states from a deployment, so trying to talk with the agency hasn't been helpful since they are rather rude. Called the college and got connected with the student help desk, at first it seemed like they were willing to help but now they are saying I'm still liable for the classes.

They want me to pay for these classes and to be honest I feel like it'd be easier to pay and forget. But I really cant afford to do that and it just doesn't seem fair to pay for something I haven't experienced.

158,How do Credits Work?,11t1w7t,"TLDR: How do credits transfer, if at all, when obtaining a second degree? Do you have to retake classes? Can previously unused credits now be used? Do you need to send multiple transcripts from every previous school or just the one you obtained your first degree from?

&#x200B;

I (22F) am about to graduate from community college with an Associates. I am first in my family to go to college and completely in the dark about credits and satisfying requirements. Every time I ask someone a question they either misinform me, shuffle me to another person or department, answer half of my question, or answer a similar, but not my, question. 

I currently have credits from high school where I did dual enrollment and AP courses. I also have credits from a university that I transferred from. I technically have enough credits to graduate already, however the college I go to has a minimum requirement of their own credits, so a lot of the courses I previously took are wasted.

I am trying to decide if I want to pursue a Bachelors or another Associates in a different field. I do not understand how this works. 

* If I went for another Associates at the same school, would I have to retake the general courses like math and history or would I be exempt because I already have the credits? Do I start over at zero, are the credits that are currently unusable the only ones that will be sufficient, or will I be able to only take electives and courses I want that are in the major program? 
* If I went for a Bachelors at a different school, how does that even work? Does my Associates become a Bachelors or would I obtain two degrees? Do I need to start from the 101 courses or would my credits transfer? If my credits do transfer, would my unused credits from the Associates be used for my Bachelors or are they still wasted? 
* The credits that are unused are called Fall Through Credits (I am unsure if this is a universal term as my friends have no idea what I am talking about, but that is what my Degree Works or the transcript analyzer tool thingy calls them). I am unable to use them because there are too many or they do not fit into a requirement  (which is complete and utter BS, but I won't get into that LOL). If I transferred to a new school, would I need a transcript from each place I received a credit from or would my college transcript be enough? I ask because when I applied to both colleges I was told at first that my previous school - high school for the first college and the first college for my current one - would send over all of the records necessary because they had already processed my information and it would all be together. Then when I started to register for classes and I noticed only half of my credits were transferred, they changed their answers and told me every school I have received a grade from needs to individually send them a transcript, which means the classes I took in high school through dual enrollment are technically not on my high school transcript (?? Four separate counselors have explained this to me and I have no clue how this is possible because my high school transcript literally has those courses on it with a grade and I never even spoke or looked at anyone or anything from the schools in which the courses were offered) and that adds three extra transcripts.

161,Help on Preparing for an MFA,11t6pyo,"TLDR: I earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering almost 10 years ago, I have worked in the military/nuclear power for the last decade and now that I'm out I'm working to pursue my lifelong dream to pursue fine art. I'm looking for some guidance from current MFA/completed MFA students on their journey, experience, and impression of the post-bacc students and the programs.

I am applying to two post-bacc./certificate programs (PAFA and NYAA respectfully), I have taken night classes over the past couple years to build up my portfolio, and I am sitting on an acceptance letter to the BFA program at ACCD. I am struggling to make a choice (assuming I can get into a post-bacc program) between the two education tracks. I really want to build by painting and print skills -- but also experiment with sculpture (embracing my past technical field, but I have no real wood working or welding experience).

I am confident that an abbreviated BFA degree would grant me the most time to hone skills and experiment (all of my Humanities and Sciences credits are waived at the moment with exception to Art History). But the 3-3.5 years maybe is a little high on diminishing returns. A post-bacc degree would leave me with more money in the GI Bill to use towards grad school, but I'm not sure I would get the targeted instruction on technique to build up skills to apply to a ""good"" MFA program. I don't want to get an MFA if it doesn't have a specific artist I really want to study with or is a highly reputable program (i.e. hard to get into) so that I can get the most exposure by galleries and other academic institutions.

Are there any Post-Bacc. degree holders who found it was useful preparation for an MFA track? Any MFA students/grads who can comment on fellow artists they met that shifted careers into art using a post-bacc as opposed to a more traditional BFA or BA path? Am I overly focused on the reputation of an MFA program?",FreshPrincefromMPLS,2,1,1.0

I get pretty decent grades for the most part, other than a dicey first semester I’ve been a Dean’s List student. But I’m not satisfied with the work I’m putting out, I miss assignments too often, and my attendance is spotty, especially for morning classes. 

I think I’m an intelligent person, and I have pretty ambitious goals, I want to eventually get a doctorate in psychology and do my own research. But I’m not conscientious enough, my head’s constantly in the clouds, and I still struggle with a lot of anxiety, and it makes problems for me and keeps me from achieving what I think I’m capable of. And because I have high expectations for myself it makes every perceived failure that much worse because it feels like I won’t be able to do what I want to down the line. I try and stay positive and work towards being better but sometimes I feel like maybe I’m just not good enough right now to do and be what I want to. It sucks because I really resonate with a lot of my course material but can never find the effort to truly stand out in my classes. I’m worried I’ll forever be someone with the tools but who never puts it all together.

173,Deciding on a Major,11sscxe,"I am currently stuck. I just transferred my associate degree from a community college to a university. I originally believed I would be majoring in BA in French Secondary Education; however, I realized that this may not be the way to go. Languages are my main passion and my main hobby, and I love learning them - but it may be unwise to turn it into a job, especially a job that has very low pay and very long working hours. I spent a year as a student teacher, and my experience had its pros and cons. 

**Class registration begins in a few days, but I will not be able to actually register for classes until mid-April. I have a meeting with an advisor via Zoom on the 20th of March.** 

I've since been looking at other majors and jobs associated with those majors that I am interested in, but I should be searching for a major that brings in a decent salary and has ease in finding a job out of university - but there is a problem with that, I am terrible at upper levels mathematics like algebra and chemistry, so that cuts out a lot of really stable and needed majors. I am also wanting a major that has me on my feet a lot, as I do not like to sit down all day. 

With all of these majors, I am okay with starting at the bottom and working my way to the top in whichever field. 

I've narrowed it down to:

**BS in Environmental and Sustainability Studies:** This is the one that is most interesting to me. But, I also recognize that the word ""studies"" may be a term that is not associated with prestige, and it does not seem like a major that would make it easy to get a job. I am thinking of getting a minor in GIS alongside this major. 

**BS in Anthropology:** One that is also very interesting to me. But, again, I also recognize that the field is very competitive and very low chances. But, I am also very interested in the various areas of study associated with Anthropology. I am thinking of getting a minor in GIS, as well as a minor in French alongside this major. 

**BA in International Relations:** This degree is interesting to me because of a few classes I took in political science, and one of those classes included an international relations course which I found myself becoming very interested in, and one of the only classes in which I actually read through the entire textbook. With this job, I recognize there are a lot of government jobs available that includes various benefits, but I also feel that this job may be very niche. I am thinking of getting a minor in French alongside this major. 

**BS in Wildlife Biology:** This degree is a lot like the Environmental and Sustainability Studies degree, and probably more useful and more likely to land me a good paying job out of university, and it is also a specialized biology degree, but it also contains six chemistry/physics/algebra courses that I really do not think I'd be able to do well in - as I got a grade of 61% in Chemistry, and a grade of 75% in Algebra II in high school. I am thinking of getting a minor in GIS alongside this major. 

**BS in Information Technology:** This degree is sort of interesting to me, but I also do not see myself doing this on a day-to-day basis. I understand computers, and know how to build them and diagnose problems, but I really am not sure if I would want to do this degree. I would be able to do it, and likely pass, but I am just not sure. For this degree, I also need to apply to a separate program within the university. 

**BBA of Business Administration in Accounting:** This degree is interesting to me, but my girlfriend thinks that I would get bored of being an accountant. I failed one class in high school, and that class was accounting - in which I got a 14%. It was just very uninteresting to me at the time. But, now that I've actually looked into it, it does not seem that bad. My friend is an accountant at a large online retailer, and he has been giving me various examples of what he does at his job and a lot of it seems pretty easy enough - a lot of repetitive work. My friend also mentioned that what they teach you in accounting classes in university is often a lot harder than what you actually do as an accountant. This degree is also one that is has a very high chance of landing me a job out of university, and it has good pay and benefits. For this degree, I would need to apply to the business school of the university - which happens to be next to my university apartment.

174,Dealing with disrespect from a college classmate,11t0tfg,"Throughout the years from elementary to early highschool, i was bullied (verbally) quite a lot. I had no friends and still don't. In late high school, for some reason, it stopped.

I thought my prospect would improve in college since I now look better than before, has improved my social ability, and am more independent from my parents.

There are many things to be said, but for now, I would like to focus on 1 particular person since I feel he's been disrupting a lot. Let's call him X. X was fine initially. I found him to be condescending but chalked it up to his personality. But now through many interactions with him, I'm sure that he just doesn't think highly of me.

He's a friend of friends and I sit a couple of seats next to him as well, so when there's a mid-sized crowd or when doing a group project, I'll inevitably encounter him which is why I can't just ignore him

When hanging out in a group or doing a group project, when I try to say something or ask something, he'll try to clown on what I'm saying by giving me the 'ugh' attitude or spinning it as a joke that doesn't answer the question.

A lot of times, I feel like he's doing his best to make me feel like I'm excluded from a group, such as steering the conversation so that I'm ignored, talked over, or responding to me with a half-assed answer in an annoyed tone. Last time I did group work with his group and he's the leader, he basically ignored me when I asked for a job so I ended up having to do the most work which wasted my studying time for the upcoming test(video editing). During the work, he just says on the group chat that I probably forgot about it. Then when I finish he (or anybody in the group) did not thank me at all and just find everything problematic about it. Basically, he made me do the bitch work, was ungrateful about it, then made fun of me afterward.

The general feeling I get from him is that anytime he needs to do something, he needs to be a smart ass about it. If I make a minor mistake in anything, he'll immediately be all over them. He treats me like an imbecile and a loser. It's almost as if he's actively rooting for me to fail.

He doesn't even respect me enough to find it awkward when I call him out like I'm a fucking piece of shit he shouldn't worry about. If I say 'well that was rude', 'i don't like that', or ask him to explain what they mean (like how I was recommended), they'll just respond back with more smug condescension like 'uhhh okay' or 'idk'

What could I do about it? To be very honest, I'm kinda scared of calling him out over and over again. I'm timid and socially awkward. I'm not good at arguing at all. So if I did that he'd run circles around me and make me out to be the odd one. As mention I can't 100% ignore him either",2Mac2Pac,4,1,1.0

I came back to my home state and my plan was to finish my sophomore year in a community college and transfer to a 4 year in my state.

Now I’m trying to re enroll at school A and they’re making me write a letter because the semester I failed destroyed my 3.6 GPA. I have to explain why I did so bad and what I’ve done since then to make sure I get a 2.0 or higher the next semester if they agree to let me back in.

I am so so nervous because they have every right to decide to not let me attend. Though I have a therapist and better coping strategies and have gotten great grades at the community college.

He has had several tantrums in front of the class where he belittled us (calling us kindergarteners, telling us how we won't be able to hold down a job, etc.) all because of students not being able to complete the sheer volume of homework that he assigns. Due to the sheer volume and it's difficulty, a lot of people can't complete the assignments, and it's not for lack of trying. Today, he yelled angrily at the entire class, wasting precious time talking about how ""the real world doesn't work like this"" and saying things like his classic ""are you all kindergarteners!?"". He spent about half of the time we had in class yelling and belittling us. I'm a graduating senior, and this is the last class I need for my minor, but I think I have no choice but to drop it. I feel cheated, because I'm getting my bachelor's degree this spring and put a lot of hard work into my minor, but I just can't endure his childish outbursts any longer.

I intend to study physics at a community college in preparation for transferring to the University of California. I am a high school dropout, and ever since, I have been learning physics and mathematics myself for the past year in order to prepare for university study (classical mechanics, linear algebra, cal 123, tensor analysis, special relativity, general relativity (the most recent one, and I am stuck!)). Because I am a high school dropout, I decided that transferring from CC would be the best way for me to attend UC.

Because many community colleges in California have a good reputation for transferring to UC, I decided to apply to two of them: Sierra College and Orange Coast College. Both community colleges look good, and they have a transfer agreement with UC, but I am not sure which one is better.

196,MBA vs Masters in Business and Technology?,11sh6cv," I'm currently working as a system admin for a university where I can use tuition assistance. I have Azure, Comptia, Cisco CCNA, Microsoft system admin expert, and Linux LPIC certs. I've worked in 2 help desk roles, and 2 system admin roles. I've been in IT field 3 years, so some say I don't need a degree, but others say I'll have a cap on my earnings if I don't get a degree.

The reason I'm considering a degree is because my previous degree was in kinesiology. Sometimes in interviews I keep getting asked why I switched from kinesiology to IT and it gets annoying. That and I'm also debating how to move into systems engineer, architect, cloud admin, or devops type role long term.

I feel like the MBT the equivalent of a masters in IT will help me in getting more IT type jobs. But, since that program is online I'm worried I won't get much networking effect as the in person MBA. The classes include 2 programming classes, a database management class, user experience, project management, and object oriented systems analysis. This program is also all online, so idk if that would be bad for networking for finding jobs/meeting people.

The MBA has more accounting, finance, marketing, operations, management, leadership, strategy, and analytics courses. However, the MBA seems more theoretical and has only 1 or 2 tech classes. But, I also think the MBA will open me up to more roles and some said that the MBA doesn't outdate itself as much as an MS does and that it's more broad. At the same time, I've never really seen an MBA listed on IT job postings.

The MBA could also be useful for a a backup plan to work as a regional gas station manager, retail store manager, or walmart manager. If I were to forget things in tech or got tired of it. I've also heard the saying that you shouldn't have a plan B and you should just focus on 1 goal if you want to be less scatter brained too.

I've been in a class for this quarter where the professor was super kind and considerate of a lot of health stuff I had going on. Ofc, I took advantage of every opportunity she gave me and have everything done that I need done. This class is online on Canvas, and EXTREMELY relaxed. Open note, open book, unproctored online. There's an assistant professor as well, and I've taken some of his classes before- he's just as relaxed.

However, the final is due tonight at midnight and... it isn't posted. They both said we would have all day to do it, we just had to turn it in before midnight tonight. However- it's just not even there. I can see that the midterm has passed, it's posted, but the final is not. I know they're slightly older and in class have sometimes needed to post things themselves, but I'm surprised because I know this class is full of go-getters who would've noticed this before, and would have asked them to post it. I simply didn't check, because yesterday I had three finals to do, and a project.

I'm worried that I may have missed something. I had it marked on my calander, it was on the canvas (that's where I got the date from) and now the reminder for it is gone. I would also look at the syllabus- and I have, it should be today, but they didn't work precisely on date to the syllabus. As far as I know, nothing changed from the last class/study session both professors held over zoom last Thursday.

I am a the only black person in my major/ course and I am facing racism from all the white girls. It is very passive aggressive. 

I initially was popular and well liked in university (a majority white university) but when I started doing better for myself e.g, dressing better, wearing makeup, got the latest iPad, being outspoken, answering questions in classes and getting national recognition they all stopped talking to me. 

Initially I thought I was the problematic person, but in social settings the girls would try make digs at me and stop inviting me out. 
I realised it is not because I am problematic because I have friends that are POC and not mean to me. 

So obviously I stopped talking to them, as I respect myself. These people have all ganged up on me and love to point out I’m black at any given point.

I also go to a prestigious university and they try to make it as if I don’t deserve to be there. These people were once my friends… 

The other white people have started to pick up that I am disliked so I am being treated bad by people I hardly know.

I have come to terms with the whole situation, but I have to deal with these people on a daily basis.

How do I go about forcing myself to knuckle down and focus on studying/assignments instead of wasting all of my time and chances screwing around?

There’s always the chance that this doesn’t happen for whatever reason though so i should be thinking about backup plans like some research role in the private sector. If this ends up happening I’m just worried that the degree being from overseas will make it less useful if the potential employers don’t know about the school.

In reality, the employment market is over saturated now due to (degree inflation) and many either end up working a different job or some shitty min wage job until they can find work in that field. 

Unless you know someone that can get you in or graduated from a “Top school” but even then I know people from top schools here in Canada that went to a top school or people in the U.S that went to a top 20 and are still looking for work in their field. 

It’s even worse from for people I know that went a community college or just took diplomas and not a full 4 year degree. 

Having your resume professionally done, volunteering, going in to apply directly and speaking with a manager, putting key words on your resume that matches job description etc. and there’s still 100 people applying for one position. Then when you do get hired, it’s usually really shit pay at the start which is way below what you should be actually be paid post-grad 

This doesn’t represent the statistics these school programs have on their pamphlets or what they hype up during orientation 

Maybe this only apply to white collar careers but if I see that they are providing info that a new grad can easily find a job after or that the average stating salary is $50 - 60k for example, students should in reality at least be able to find work and with that starting salary.

the one reason i can think of classmates no liking me is when i ask the professor a question and a student wants to answer for them. it really annoys me so i don’t look at the student answering, i just stay looking at the professor waiting for their answer. because it’s like i don’t pay students to teach me, im paying the professor. but other than that i keep to myself.

There is no real opportunity to socialize or interact as they blast extremely loud music that drowns out any attempt at conversation. I think most people are there to hook up. 

Outside of clubs and the party scene, I have found that most people are homebodies and just want to stay in and play video games.

Here's the deal, though; I never end up using my notes. I can't recall the last time I looked up notes for past math classes or any other class. If I need information, I search for it, or during tests/exams where notes are permitted, I often just end up using the textbook if not similar practice problems.

When I have exams that allow notes, I find myself not really, if at all, using the notes I wrote because they just don't really help me with the problems I have to solve, and the textbook has what I need instead (that's where my notes come from).

I've honestly now just considered stopping writing notes. I tell myself that the countless hours I spend writing, formatting, and paraphrasing them into bullets could be spent much better, like practicing problems or honestly catching up on other coursework.

I keep seeing people say, ""notes are amazing. I write tons of notes, highlighters, underlines, hand-written notes, notes, notes notes,"" and I just don't get it. Googling ""Should I take notes"" also just gives countless people swearing by notes.

It’s a 2.5 year program and is a very demanding and time consuming program. Similar to the workload/ schedule of a nursing student. The likelihood of me being able to succeed in the program and hold a part time job on the weekends is unlikely. I don’t think I will be able to handle the workload and take the toll it will put on my mental health. So I’m pretty sure I’m going to have to take a loan out to pay for rent each month. Financial aid’s max loan is $12,500 a year AND I still have to pay for tuition. I’m still waiting to get my financial aid letter to see what aid I get. My rent is going to be around $1200 a month, with a roommate living off campus. Living on campus is about the same. So in the time I’ll be in the whole length of the program, I’ll have to pay about $36,000 just for rent. Is it a bad idea to use a loan to pay for rent during this time?",Big_Respect6379,2,1,1.0

275,Transient Student Question,11qwyna,"Hello. SO, I’m one class away from finishing my degree in social sciences from FSU (I’m an online student there).
HOWEVER, I was accepted into a data science bachelors program this Fall at a really good school a few hours away and I would like to go to it. The only thing keeping me from going is the fact I won’t have money to pay rent. I’ve been using my pell grant to pay my bills so far, but once I get that bachelors from FSU, I can’t get the pell grant anymore. (I have 3 more semester left that I can use the pell grant out of my lifetime eligibility use)
So my question for y’all is: can I postpone my FSU graduation, go to that school for data science for FALL 2023-SPRING 2024, and then take that final class from FSU the following summer. Then I’d go back to finish the data science program the next year. This route would still allow me collect the pell grant for this next academic year.
FSU has a policy that allows you to not take classes for 3 consecutive terms before they kick you out. But can I be a student at another college during those 3 terms?

My Background: I’m a first generation college student who is confused about school and needs the advice. I go to school for free because I was in foster care and get tuition exemption till I’m 28, which is why getting another degree ain’t a big deal to me.

My brother finds this so stupid and says that they're just greedy and just want money. 'How does it effect them if I retake the class 5 times I still live 15 minutes away'. My point of view is they're pretty lenient with still offering it on your 2nd attempt most people who are serious about school would've learned why they failed and fixed it. You pretty much have to fail it on purpose the 2bd time or just not care which is a fair reason for them to charge out of state tuition. Also you could just take the class at another college and transfer the credit.

281,I’m about to go into my senior year and I don’t know if I want to finish my degree,11qurze,"I’m currently doing a divisional social science degree that emphasizes philosophy, sociology, and psychology. I started out my undergraduate experience as a psych major, but after realizing last semester that my school doesn’t offer the psych courses that I’m truly interested in, I decided enough was enough and switched to this degree. My rationale at the time was that I a) don’t waste the credits I earned from psych, b) get to take classes in other departments that I’m also interested in, and c) increase my marketability for both jobs and grad school, depending on which I decide to go into after graduation.

The reason I’m unsure of wanting to stay in this program is that many of the sociology courses that I need are being taught by profs with awful ratemyprofessors ratings. I know that those ratings should be taken with a grain of salt at times, but they’re overwhelmingly negative and patterns pretty quickly present themselves within those ratings. These issues aren’t present with the philosophy department, so I think I would have a better time doing that, and I have enough psych classes under my belt that I could take a minor in that.

Really, the hesitance to switch majors stems from a worry that I won’t actually enjoy the philosophy courses. I doubt that I can get a job with either of these degrees without grad school, so I guess that shouldn’t be a factor in the decision. I’m going to be honest: I don’t know what I want to do with my life, but at least some things I am considering are law school, a master’s in sociology and criminology, school psychology, and education (high school social studies).

I have a research class I’m taking which I have no clue what’s going on and the professors won’t help, I have a chem class where the professor is failing almost the whole class the test averages are below a 50%.

I'm a second year international student in Hong Kong who got notified of scholarship termination. I have failed to achieve the CGPA of 3.0 (mine is 2.87) however the cost of education is very high, so I was planning on taking GAP year and enrolling in internships, work on my mental and physical health, find part-time jobs etc. But I'll quit my university after the GAP year because I'm doing it just for the visa (otherwise if I dropout now the visa will not be legal.) 

It is very upsetting of course but I try to stay positive and open for new experience. On the other hand, I am now wondering if I can ever become a scholarship holder at other universities. Since I was enrolled at university and failed to increase my CGPA, the application might not be strong enough. I had issues with mental and physical health that impacted a lot on my education during the last semester thus I wasn't in my best condition to continue get good grades.

I've been taking classes at my local community college for the past year and a half in hopes of transferring to UMich to study electrical engineering. Right now, I just need to wrap up my physics and calculus and I am all set. However, today I was wondering if it would be such a crazy idea to retake my core stem classes at university. For reference, I got As or A- in all of my calculus, physics, and chemistry classes at CC. Also I wrote this on my phone, so sorry if the formatting is bad. Here's some pros and cons I've thought of.


Pros:


Better understanding: I would have a deeper understanding of calculus, physics, and chemistry after a retake, as I could focus more on the nitty gritty rather than what I need to pass the test. In addition, it could also fill any gaps in my knowledge preparing me better for future classes.


Confidence Builder: I come from a small town and small community college, so the transfer will be a large culture shock in many ways. Having classes I feel comfortable taking might make the adjustment that much more bearable.


---


Cons:


Waste of time/money: It might be a waste of time and money to retake classes I've already passed, although to be fair if I didn't take them at community college in the first place I probably wouldn't have gotten into UMich.


Weeder Classes: I know these introductory courses are infamous for being much more difficult than they should be, and I would hate if I had to slog through a class that I didn't have to take in the first place.",Swarmy593,2,1,1.0

I transferred to a 4 year college to continue my studies and get my bachelor's degree but due to finding it harder than community college and some personal issues, I got academically dismissed after one semester due to poor grades.

I also feel a bit out of place as hardly any of my friends are the same race as me/ grew up in similar backgrounds. I've made a good group of friends and I really do appreciate them, but I feel like I don't have the same goals and aspirations as them. I'm very much a free spirit, with a feeling that I have my entire life ahead of me. My friends are less ambitious than and I am, and sometimes I feel like I want more out of life.

However, I'm very much a grass is greener type of person. I am always comparing. But I don't know if I want to spend the next three years at this institution. Any advice?",Serenaddopper_,5,3,0.81

I'm reaching out here for some help. I'm currently in a Senior Seminar class at York College of Pennsylvania (Not going to say which major or professor as a precaution) and it is not going well.

After I got my degree, I wanted to get an Advanced Certificate in Geospatial Sciences to make me look better to hirers. On both the Geospatial Centers website (https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/gss/education/graduate.php) and the Graduate School Bulletin (https://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/graduatebulletin/current/academicprograms/gsp/requirements.php) it says “No more than 6 credits used to satisfy another graduate degree can be applied to the certificate.” I took this to mean that I could use my credits from GIS Fundamentals I even though I had already graduated using those credits. And the thing is, when I was first applying to the program and was in contact with the program director, they AGREED with me. So I was all set to get this certificate in two semesters. The director of graduate programs also agreed and told me to remind them come spring that these credits need to be applied.

Come this February, however, and the graduate program director comes in and says that these credits actually CANT be applied and I have to take another class either over the summer or in the fall to complete the degree. So they want me to spend over $1000 more to study for another semester that I have been promised over and over again that I wouldn’t have to take.

321,scared i made the wrong choice of major....,11q1tjj,"i was majoring in computer science previously. my parents loved it, they said it's THE best major for money, employment, opportunities, etc... and while i get that, i realized i had 0 interest or passion in it. i  had no motivation or drive to learn anything, studying and learning became a burden i wanted to ignore, and i ended up not doing well in the classes

i knew i needed to switch majors. i came across a major called informatics, and was immediately interested.

to give context for anyone unaware... informatics is basically all about using information and technology for society. it involves some technical skills from computer science and information science, with a people-centered perspective. it often leads to jobs like ux design, machine learning, data science, ai, etc... all things that combine people and technology ([https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/programs/informatics](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/programs/informatics) )

i'm only in my first semester in this major, but i've already been loving it. the content is so engaging to me personally. i really can envision myself getting a job in a related field.

BUT, my dad is having some doubts about my decision to transfer. the field is newer, and more interdisciplinary, and he says that this makes it a lousy major. in his opinion, a major should be a traditional, established discipline, rather than something like informatics which has only been created recently, as newly created things could be trends that quickly decline. he also says that interdisciplinary majors are not good because it doesn't give me any specific hard skill that i can be really good at.

i'm super engaged in the content, and i feel like i could thrive in this major and put in the work to get opportunities. however, i'm worried that what my dad is saying is true.. maybe informatics is a not-respectable, or unstable, or useless major.

i don't want to be setting myself up for failure. i'm wondering now if i should be switching back to cs and just try to bear with it, or find another major.

344,How do you guys deal with a challenging period of a semester? (Undergrad physics major),11prd9k,"Hello everyone. I am currently a second year physics bachelor’s student (year 2/3). Though I enjoy physics and maths thoroughly and have a decent GPA (not amazing, just decent), I have noticed that it has gotten progressively more challenging. I know that this is the natural progression of things considering that the courses start to become more demanding. But let me give you a quick context.

I am currently taking cosmology and electrodynamics (Griffith’s level) this period. Along with a practical on data analysis. I enjoy cosmology quite a lot despite all of the work needed to be put into it. E&M at first felt like classical mechanics. In the sense that it is not something I found naturally exciting, but as I am working through it I start to appreciate some of the insights gathered through the theory and the problem sets. The data analysis practical is just a painful course where we’re given a bunch of codes that don’t work properly and need to spend tedious amounts of time on it in the span of a week to hand-in an assignment (this being done almost weekly). 

Despite all the positives mentioned above, because of the structure of a period at my university (which is 6 weeks and then a finals week) I started to feel very stressed and behind on all three of my coursework. Cosmology is the easiest to catch up with (not because the content is easy, far from it. But because I actually enjoy doing it). But I am so far behind on E&M. I’m just finishing the content for the second week while we are heading into week 5 already. And it is painfully hard to try and catch up on time (as the problems in Griffith’s take quite a bit of time to solve sometimes. As I still have to get used to setting up the problems. And I don’t feel comfortable moving on despite being behind. Which I should really work on). And the data analysis course became something I do last minute as I have very little interest in doing the assignments (despite knowing that this is one of the most crucial skills I can work on in my degree for both inside and outside of academia). 

I’ve had many challenging periods (and semesters in general before), but slugging through it all is occasionally so damn hard. How do some of you manage it? And if you’re already done with your undergraduate, you can also chime in and tell me how you did it.",wxd_01,0,3,1.0
345,College review: Trinity College Dublin,11pr2lg,"I’m currently finishing my 4th year in Psychology at Trinity College in Dublin, and have had a challenging experience as a student. 
It is worth stating that my own personal life has been complicated in a negative way through college, and that I was in need of psychological support during my course, and while I hold the college’s student support services accountable for that, it would be unfair to paint the college with that stroke. More broadly,however, are the problems of course management. 

Student feedback for coursework is sub par, sparse, and at the discretion of the lecturer. This is to say, there are many staff who underperform in their guidance of students, and this is largely perpetuated by the expectations of staff by the college board. It is very easy to underperform as a lecturer and course designer in this college. 

Assignment requirements, in this case, for the final year thesis, are unclear and often poorly clarified between staff members. Ours is due tomorrow and it’s details and marking requirements have been available for months, and they posted new assignment requirements to be included today- the absence of which would result in a 0 mark. 23 hours prior to the submission deadline.

Aside from the course, administration is shocking. There was an error in my module assignment at the start of the academic year and it took the admin team 6 weeks to assign me to my modules, of what is a 12 week term. Half of the term. The admin team in the Module department did not ultimately fix this problem, but a high ranking member of the Department of psychology (all my modules) could amend this at their discretion, and given how the delay was affecting my performance and the likelihood I would repeat, she could take executive action in enrolling me in the modules.

Social elements of the college are really well managed, but this is only for the effort of the students. Many times, student societies have strayed from ambitious events and student works, because there is a history of society runners being left out to dry by the college. PR faux pas would be acceptable, but what I refer to is instances of expressed financial support by the college being withdrawn by the college, at the 11th hour.

The best thing for its student body would be a hard knock to its reputation, as it might push for better treatment and regard for students. As a college, it does not recognise other institutions as competitors, and so does not take competitive action in providing students with a worthwhile student experience.",ElectricalJacket780,4,4,0.83

I graduated but I didnt major in anything and I still dont know what to major in. Thats why I went to community college because I didnt know what I wanted to do. But I still want to pursue a four year because I dont want my degree to be for nothing. I guess in terms of topics I like I do like looking at data and coming up with conclusions about it. I was never good at math in school however. I did take a lot of biology courses in community college I liked. I however would not want to work in healthcare tbh personally.

I am interested in perspectives on this for people who got their degrees in the typical fashion, associates then bachelors etc, etc.  

I am also interested in perspectives on my specific situation, where I received my associates years after my two higher degrees through the “reverse transfer” process, whereby having a bachelors in the subject automatically makes you eligible for an associates.  I don’t know if that is a thing in many states, but in my state (Texas) you can basically get a “free associates degree” if you took coursework at a community college and later transferred to a 4 year university and earned a bachelors degree.",Cruiser5139,5,5,0.86

359,Life Advice.... or well college advice,11pc1kk,"Context: An 18 year old Lad who really doesn't want to screw up again, after quite a while..

Um... I don't usually do this but I'm just out of options.
So I'm an A level student affiliated with a University in my country of origin and at the end of the Foundation one year program we'd be assimilated into the main university system as 2nd Year Students each with our respective majors and degree programs, but there's a catch. 
Our performance in the National Final A level exams would determine the degree programmes we'd be eligible for. 

Now bear in mind that I graduated high school in 2020 at the age of 15 but was denied entry into any Federal or state school cause the official age to be considered for admissions is 16, and my folks can't afford private tertiary education. It's too expensive. 

I did A levels in 2021 and had an average of 14 out of the 16 cumulative points and applied to the Federal University of my state of residence and was denied admissions because I didn't meet the requirements for a Bachelor's in Medicine and a Bachelor's in surgery which was what I applied for, having a cut off of 16 out of 16 available cumulative points so yeah, a perfect score. 

In 2022 I sat for the Unified tertiary matriculation examination procured and regulated Joint Admissions Matriculation Board and had an aggregate of 293/400 which may seem pretty low but with the national average being 200/400 I'd say more than decent, though I screwed up with my Post UTME exams and that made my merit aggregate to be somewhere around the sixties and since I applied for MBBS again which had a cut off of 82.3 I was denied admissions once more. 

Not gonna lie, I've been depressed about it for a while..

Turned 18 this year and my folks decided to spring for another A level programme. 
The thing is I don't know whether to apply for MBBS again this time....
It's always been my dream to be a doctor but I don't think I have another letdown left in me... That'll leave me shattered.

I've been studying hard and doing my very best to make a perfect score of 16 this time around but we had to go home due to elections being conducted (which makes no sense to me) and the break was even extended so I'll be spending month at home by March 21st and it's really been affecting my productivity levels, haven't really been studying due to chores and had well just being lazy...

I'm scared that If I apply for MBBS again this year and I fall shy of a perfect score, I'd be defeated..
It's been a long and hard 3 years for me but I know my folks can't afford Private Medical Tertiary education, and I know some of y'all would say I should have been working to save up for tuition. 

I did work but in a third world country where minimum monthly wage is 30k and Private Medical Tertiary education is minimum of 6M a year, and it's a programme for 6 years you can see why that's not feasible. 

Do I give up on my dreams and go for another programme that's less competitive just so I can graduate and move on with my life 
Or do I give my dream one more shot.....

I've prayed and spoken to the Lord but I did all of that last year with the UTME exams and even applied to the school I had a dream about thinking it was Him leading me there. No such luck, not even a transfer to a different programme

I'm just really tired and feel like I'm getting too old to be able to afford denials in a country where even 17 year olds are already in second year (in Private schools of course but like I said, my folks can't afford it)

I’ve already taken all of the exams for all the classes once, and have passed all of them. But I’m not quite satisfied with two of my grades. So, I figured I should try to retake them. Both of them are a big deal. The catch is, they take into account the latest grade and *not* the highest. Aka if I fail I’m fucked pretty much and will have to retake the class which will set me back because both are a perquisite to the classes I should be taking next semester.

I don’t want to settle for these grades because I know I can do better. For one of these classes, I’ve been practicing by taking practice exams (which are finals taken from previous semesters) but I’ve not seen a consistently good enough improvement on my part to be able to say “I’ll go in and get at least a 85/100” (which is my goal).

However, it gets a little awkward for me when I slowly learned that my friends are ""rich"" rich— like they are old money rich!

I didn't know that, I just assumed that my friends are like me who came from a lower mid class family. They were all really private about their riches (which is understandable) but learning that everyone of them are rich...

And recently, my college bestfriend invited me and our other friend (lets call him friend A) to their house. It was obvious that my best friend's parents prefer friend A because he's vibe is screaming ""crazy rich"" who has generational wealth, plays musical instruments, and other typical rich asian thing.

I really want to help them figure this out. So I'm creating a short online course that will guide them through the writing process and hopefully clear up the most common questions university students have about how to write. 

The thing that makes me most concerned about students is the fact that they all, of course, think that the problem is with them, and it isn't. 

Writing an academic paper is a totally unintuitive task. It's its own special piece of intellectual gymnastics that professors expect students to know how to do, when no one has taught them. And the rules and objectives aren't clear, or consistent from teacher to teacher, course to course, or subject to subject.  I somehow figured this out about halfway through college, and my papers got a lot better pretty much instantly. I even got a perfect score on the GRE writing test.

382,Late fees and finance charges,11oqova,"What is the best way to attempt to negotiate fees and charges with my college?

To try and make a long story short, I’m in college and also a member of the national guard. Guardsmen in my state get both federal tuition assistance and state tuition assistance. It basically adds up to free tuition because the state picks up what the federal TA doesn’t cover. However, it has taken forever for the school to receive that money. I’ve done everything I can on my end and done so in a timely manner but it takes a few weeks for the invoices to be processed and money to be sent to the school. I’ve also recently discovered that my school was not doing what THEY needed to be doing to receive that money. 

Because my account was not at a zero balance, the school put a hold on my account and would not let me register for the next semester. So now I am taking a gap year against my will. I argued that the reason my account wasn’t at zero is because of the TA money, but they insisted that I’d still have to pay the various late fees and finance charges that my account had accumulated.

Because I have a hold on my account, I can’t even withdrawal from the university. So my account is still accumulating charges as I type this. Just recently got hit with a $75 late fee and a $35 finance charge. 

I’ve tried fighting this with the financial aid office, but they won’t even provide me with an updated billing statement. What do I do? Take this up with the president of the university?",rockykb,7,3,0.81

Only problem for me, I feel the easier to attain PS degree is not applicable, as it has zero international focus, only domestic. IR is so much more intriguing and applicable, but I have a learning disability that would conflict with the foreign language requirement of the IR degree. 

I was wondering if it is at all possible to switch this requirement from a language to more anthropology/culture studies since all that the language will do anyways is be more about international perspective I believe.",wownicename,2,1,1.0

My professor gave an exam with the average being like, a 55. The other class, the average was around the same. 

Our class? No curve. Their class? 40 point curve. One of them took it last semester (here you can take lab and lecture separately), and didn’t really know what was going on in class and still had like, a 96.

Same exam material. Same course. Just different professor. 

And it’s not that stuff isn’t getting curved that bothers me, it’s that it’s not consistent through the department. So making an A or failing doesn’t really come down to effort, doesn’t come down to if you truly know the material, sometimes it literally just comes down to if your professor curves or not while other professors do.

But whenever later on if I say ""sorry about if I seemed off earlier I was just stressed"" she ALWAYS feels the need to say ""See!!

398,Productivity in traditional (in-person) versus online (self-paced) learning environments for a neurodivergent individual.,11o606t,"When I was attending college in a traditional environment with in-person lectures, no matter the size of the lecture (12 attendees to 200+), I always felt so uncomfortable with the social aspect of attending class and interacting with classmates from day to day that my social anxiety caused my attendance to suffer significantly.

The pressure of presenting myself as a socially-competent human being in public *and also* be learning new, difficult material at the same time was too much for my neurodivergent brain. There are several classes which I remember attending less than five times over the semester, then scraping together a C at the end or maybe a B in some cases through teaching myself at home.

I withdrew during the second semester of sophomore year due to my first manic episode and was later diagnosed with bipolar type 1.

After spending some years working, learning about the world, discovering who I am, and finding my purpose in this life, I decided to re-enter academia. Some poking around online led to signing up for an accredited online program with tuition half the cost of the most affordable in-state program that interested me.

My program is an accelerated self-paced program that runs in three trimesters over the course of the year, or six terms of eight weeks each in total. Taking two classes per eight-week term is considered full-time. I'm taking just one class, so I'm a part-time student.

They offer free tutoring services literally 24/7, which is perfect for those 3am homework binges I've been known to get into on occasion, and there are no Zoom lectures, which are the bane of my very existence.

Today was a highly productive day. I finished and submitted an assignment not due for a couple more days, and I did it in my underwear at home. One of the benefits of self-paced online college is never having to even get dressed unless I have other demands during the day.

The course I'm taking right now is Discrete Mathematics.

I got home from the gym and reopened the assignment pretty much immediately, intending to do damage. I'd already written out the answers to the assignment on paper earlier in the week. Now I just had to type it up into a coded document.

It took a few hours of somewhat tedious work, which I expected. Despite the initial process going very slowly, I'm beginning to get faster and gain comprehension as I slog through coding all the symbols. I'm focusing on making my assignments as correct, specific, and readable as possible so I will continue to receive an A, and this just takes time.

Thankfully, the course provides plenty of examples and tutorials to help.

All I'm saying is that online college works way better for me than traditional in-person college because I have a quiet home life and am at a point where I am able to motivate myself to succeed.

The college provided me with a friendly advisor who seems to really care about helping me best progress through my studies and complete my degree. My advisor said that each course should roughly translate to 3\*(the number of credit-hours) per week of work, so a course that is 3.0 credit-hours might take 9 hours of studying and homework each week. That was close to true for my previous course, English II.

However, my advisor also said that some courses, like the one I'm in currently, Discrete Math, may take 15 or more hours of work per week. She said that my next course, Intro to Scripting, could even take 25 hours per week to be successful.

I thanked her for the warning.

The course materials open two weeks prior to the start of the course, so for this Discrete Math course, by the date the course actually began, I had the whole first week of notes completed already. Being able to enjoy having a head start in a class is an unfamiliar feeling to me as I have had major issues with procrastination and motivation in the past.

This online, self-paced course seems to help me so far.

Another thing is that I'm not a teenager anymore. After gaining some life experience, I've learned that sitting still for a few hours a day to complete notes or homework is very far from the worst thing that can happen. Having seen a bit of the world, I would much rather put in the work now when I have the opportunity, and since I'm paying for it anyway.",throwitawaybongybong,1,3,0.81

400,I feel really uncomfortable with my roommate's guests,11nc0qp,"So basically I had been staying in the dorms with this one guy, he got in a car accident and broke his legs like 2 weeks into winter quarter and moved back home. I was alone for a few weeks and I finally got a new roommate about 3 weeks ago.

Dude has always struck me as a bit odd, like as soon as the RA left our room after his move in he immediately asked me how he should handle having guests over for ""private time"" and I told him just give me a heads up over text, and he immediately responded with ""just a fair warning, I'll probably be texting you a fair bit"", and not to sound rude or anything, but I kinda wanted to laugh at that. He's some dorky and awkward computer science freshman who doesn't really strike you as the guy with a lot of game, but I thought maybe he had a gf or something or was just trying to look cool, but sure enough I've ended up getting like 2 or 3 texts a week saying that he needed the dorm to himself.

Anyways, fast forward to today and I have work after class. As my shift is coming to an end I get a text saying that he has a friend over but that they were decent now and just watching a movie.

So I come back to my dorm and open the door expecting him to be with some girl, and to my complete shock he's sitting there on his bed cuddled up with some dude who is at least 35 and probably like 6'5"" and 350lbs. After some introduction I asked if they were dating or something and he said that they were just friends. I asked him if he took classes here or something and he said no and that they met online.

I'm currently sitting at my computer desk typing away on my phone and still trying to process what's going on and how to handle this. They're both still here and I just feel kinda uncomfortable with this whole situation. 

I had no idea that he was gay, and honestly I don't have an issue with it, but come on, are there not any gay guys your age you could fuck?

 I'm just kinda creeped out with the idea of someone (potentially multiple people) who could be this guy's dad with no real connection to the school just coming in to my living space multiple times a week.

404,Athletics Department Loophole for Basketball,11nxsad,"Hello everyone, I wanted to let out a loophole that has been irritating one of the clubs I am an officer in this past year. 

I am currently an officer for a badminton club here in the university, and we have reserved space to play on Sunday nights and Wednesday nights. Note that the badminton court lines are a overlapped with the main basketball court students play on. 

One of the main issues we have been seeing recently is that people play basketball (open runs) around the same time we have reserved a time slot to play badminton. These open runs as far as I know is not a reserved time for them, rather people just come and play from a group chat. The reason why I say it is a problem is because of how basketball people invade the space for badminton, which causes us to not have actual space to play. A loophole aside from this when we contacted the gym manger is that the Athletic's department states that basketball athletes (people in the team) ""are priority"" and can use the court how they want. In addition with this, their season is already over and some how they are still exempted.  

With all of this in mind, what would you say about this current conflict? Fair, not fair? Obviously, from my stand point that I find this unfair.

I am in my second year of undergraduate biology, General Biology II, and I am doing worse than I did in General Biology I simply because my professor administers multiple-choice exams. I am used to taking written exams and getting A+'s on each one.

Here are just a few of their misleading claims: 

**“The average Campus Managers earn $8K a school year. Top CMs earn $40K+.”**

*Reality: Mean, median, mode. With 250 campus managers, that could mean the top 10% make $40k, the next 15% make $25k, and the vast majority earn $270. Ask them how much the median CM earns? Or how many CM’s are within one or two standard deviations of the $8k mean?*

**“We cover all of the costs involved in training you.”**

*Reality: Training is unpaid.*

**“Gain entrepreneurial experience.”**

*Reality: An entrepreneur develops/patents a product, forms a business around it, secures investment, hires & fires employees, and is in control of setting the prices and sales territories. Campus Managers do none of those things. This job is like to being a Sales Rep where you sell $x and are paid a % of $x. However, legitimate sales reps usually have exclusive territories or industries, so that reps are not competing with each other. That’s not the case here. You’re competing with multiple other Campus Managers, sometimes in your own organization.*

My question is: How long (roughly) before I can get merit-based scholarships if I keep this up? I have a scholarship already, but it's unrelated to my GPA and ends in a year. Is it unreasonable to think that I could get merit-based scholarships by then?

My friend is a psych major and goes to Austin Peay which is a liberal arts college and I’m thinking of transferring there as the social aspect and career opportunities are a lot better there. The other problem that’s keeping me from transferring is I live with my previously mentioned brother. I also live an hour away from my hometown and I’m used to going home almost every weekend to see my family. The college I want to transfer to is 2 hours away from there.

481,How do I untangle my self-worth from my grades?,11m4yzy,"Throughout middle and high school, I experienced appreciable academic struggle. Don't get me wrong; I loved school and learning, but that didn't stop me from failing several classes when I didn't do homework, cheated, and didn't try on assignments. Following this sense of failure, I erected self-imposed limitations on what i believed I was able to achieve, defining myself as lesser than what I was truly capable of. 

However, after entering college, my outlook shifted. I started contemplating my future and what it would be like if I were to continue on the path I was headed. Needless to say, I didn't like what I saw, and it led me to establish the goal of attending graduate school. I recognized that, to achieve this goal, I must receive high grades all throughout college, especially since I did not do very well during my first semester. I did not know hard hard it would be, but I did not care because I wanted to succeed no matter what it took. This realization seemed to be the impetus for my transformation into a determined academic. I started trying and, to my chagrin, it wasn't that hard. I remember thinking that I had wasted my chance in high school to do well, and all this time, that was all it took to rise to the top. I was mad at myself, and I made a promise to never stop trying just because I didn't think I was capable of something.

Regrettably though, my self-worth has since become tied to my college success, leading to an unhealthy fixation on my grades and approval from academic figures. Waiting for marks gives me this sense of dread now because they seem to serve as either a source of brief happiness or extended depression, dictating my mood and affecting my self-esteem with every canvas update. This unhealthy preoccupation on academic performance has resulted in significant anxiety and stress for me, making it difficult to enjoy learning as I previously had, even when I was not doing so well. I used to celebrate over a B, much less anything higher, whereas now I just had a mental breakdown from getting an 89% on an essay because the TA didn't like my premise. I don't know why I feel so broken up about it either. I still have an A; it's just that something about a 99% going to a 93% hurts so much for some reason. I even get negative feelings over less than perfect grades on small assignments that are barely worth any points. I'm not certain I even know how to really explain it, but I know it has taken a toll on my self-worth and mental health overall.

I want to learn how to untangle my self-worth and mood from my academic performance so that I can have a more healthy, sustainable view of myself.

484,Take Calc 3 in-person full semester or online half semester.,11m5raj,"Hello everyone! I'm currently a freshman double majoring in chemical engineering and microbiology, I'm planning out my fall sophomore year schedule, and I need some help deciding how to take Calc 3.

My current schedule is:

Ochem 2 - Online full semester

Ochem 2 lab - in-person full semester Tuesday

Chemical processing - in-person full semester Tuesday/Thursday

Immunology (400 level) - in-person full semester Tuesday/Thurday

Bioethics - online first half semester

Elementary linear algebra (2 credit hours) - online second half semester

Calculus 3 (for engineers) - in-person full semester Monday/Wednesday

&#x200B;

I am debating changing Calculus 3 into an online second half semester as well in order to keep my Monday/Wednesday completely open for schoolwork, jobs, internships, etc.

I am fairly good at math, I got a 5 on AP Calculus AB my junior year of high school but I didn't take BC because of a schedule conflict.

First semester with chem 2, genetics, and other courses (19 credit hours) I got all A+s.

This semester I am in Calculus 2 and have a B+ right now, I got an 85 on the first test. I also currently have an A+ in ochem 1, microbiology, and my other courses, but a C in physics 1 mechanics :/

I know Calc 3 is a difficult class, so I am not sure if taking it online for the latter half of the semester is a good idea (in addition to linear algebra being that latter half, but I've heard it's easy).

485,Is it unethical to use marijuana for assignments (legal state)?,11mjb0c,"So I was wondering if using it while doing school work is allowed in college. 

After all, similarly, adhd medications are not allowed to be taken by people not diagnosed properly by a doctor. 

It makes me:
-more creative
-potentially able to express myself better
-able to engage in an activity for a long period of time while actively enjoying it. Getting bored is a regular part of studying or so I’ve read, so it would be a game changer to that norm. Nothing would be stopping you from just spending all your time studying if you could be high and enjoyed it like I do. And in the process it only slightly, if it all, impairs my memory because I have a tolerance and don’t smoke like I did in my first year(s). 🤷‍♂️

 at the same time, i also feel like I could really use the weed to, say, write a really good essay or something. 

I actually have potentially really great ideas with weed especially if I put in a lot of effort (but weed will make the effort much more smooth and enjoyable so it doesn’t seem like torture), which I was considering doing, no idea why, I don’t need it for the grade but I don’t have much going on in life and want to get the most out of the class. 

Well, I already had a conversation with this professor letting them know I took 3 concerta pills for their class for studying for a test 
EDIT: awkward, didn’t even realize that I didn’t say that it was for a test it could’ve been interpreted like a person below to mean to take  to class. 
via legitimate prescription because in the past I told her I potentially have ADD but am unmedicated (So I had to be honest and correct the record otherwise she’ll think I potentially worked harder than I did and I felt bad about that.)

Anyways, usually I wouldn’t think twice about smoking weed before doing work, but, and this is critical, I told her I wouldn’t take the pills anymore, for any of my classes. So I don’t want to do the same thing again and end up feeling bad because of a miscommunication where she thinks I’m putting in lots of hard effort when in reality I’m having a good time getting stoned and have an advantage over other students",Throwaway123652,11,0,0.33
486,I really enjoy math but idk if the major is for me :(,11lxy2t,"Hey y'all- I know this is a relatively common type of post on this subreddit but I'm hoping you could entertain me bc I'm very much freaking out. So I'm in the middle of my 4th semester at university, and I'm in a bit of a funky position.

I've been a pre-med biology major since I got here, and I've been reasonably successful at it ( volunteering, research, <3.7 GPA, etc.)! Except this semester, I'm taking upper-div bio classes alongside 2 upper-div math classes - Probability and Linear Algebra - and I \*much\* prefer the work I do for those classes. I also took stats last semester, which i loved too. I really do enjoy math, especially logic, at least based on the work I've done for these courses so far.

So I kinda impulsively declared a math major a month ago, since I was already tryna leave pre-med for various reasons. 2-ish weeks later, I get back midterm grades for each of those classes, which I had worked my ass off studying for, and one is an 82 and the other a 78 :/ I did all the practice problems, group study sessions, wtv, and I barely cleared a passing grade.

The worst part is that most of it wasn't because of a lack of understanding, it was really dumb ""silly"" mistakes - blanking on a combination formula, messing up arithmetic on gaussian elimination, etc etc.  Can't help but think that my brain just doesn't work in a math-y way :( this is also coming from a background of failing math twice in high school lol

But still regardless of this, I've been reading up on basic topology and algebra (at least what i can understand for now) and it's really fascinating to me. I wish i could ignore that I'm just not a good test-taker and do what I enjoy but my classes are all weighted 70%+ to exams + the impeding stress of grad school admissions.

Idk I think my STEM gpa is gonna be like a 3.4-3.5 after this semester (bless the bio/chem courses holding her up) but it's been a steady downward trend since I started getting into math. Ugh someone give me some advice pls anything is welcome.",Random-Fog4884,5,6,0.88

494,accused of plagiarism.,11mbeft,"I'm in a senior capstone course that is all group work. Today my group got called in to talk to the two professors teaching the class and they told us that part of our recent paper got tagged as plagiarized. They mentioned this having repercussions into our professional careers and possible disciplinary action (expulsion). When we asked what was plagiarized they mentioned the section I had written. I owned up to having written the section (not plagiarising) and asked what about it seemed plagiarized since I had cited my source for the section when relevant and had taken the time to reword what info I had written about from the source. They said the program they ran it through said it had 0% similar to the source and they flagged it as plagiarized because of that specifically. They also said the writing ""didnt sound like a student"" but ive heard that since middle school. I've always been told that having any percentage of similarities is bad but they are saying the opposite. I asked if my citations were incorrect but they said no and that everything was fine and that no disciplinary actions would be taken.
At the beginning of the meeting they made it sound like drastic actions would be taken but once I said I was the one who wrote the section they said we could go and everything would be fine... is this normal? 
I'm now terrified that my group no longer trusts me and that I'm going to get an email from the dean over spring break telling me not to come back. I reread the section and I cited the source at the end of sentences containing information from the source directly and sometimes after the relevant info in the middle of the sentence. I'm just really confused since they came out guns blazing talking about expulsion but at the end of the meeting they gave people hugs and said not to worry about anything.

496,Has anyone else had roommate problems?,11mayki,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I currently attend a public university in Texas, and have truly enjoyed my time there! That is, everything except for the time I have had to spend with my roommate... I will refer to him as ""Jake"" for anonymity. At the beginning of the year, he was quite a cool person. We would frequently converse, play games together, et cetera, et cetera. You know, common roommate activities? I'm stating this as context in an attempt to not lead any extrapolations in my prescriptions, and I must make it clear that he was a good guy for a long time, until this last month.

Around the middle of February, I began to notice various changes in Jake's behavior. At first, they were small changes that I looked past out of a desire to not ""rock the boat."" These behaviors include staying awake deep into the night, making strange noises (such as sudden, deep breaths), and disregarding my requests for him to change these behaviors. These were all excusable behaviors, and not subjects I wished to involve an RA or any authorities.

That was, until I began to discover drug paraphernalia laid out around his belongings. I don't mind if anyone does drugs (or medicines), as it is their choice to do so. When it becomes a problem, however, is when it may potentially get me into trouble. At first, I asked him to stop this, but of course, just as before, he ignored my pleas.

My question is, is there anything else I can do? It feels terrible sitting here twiddling my thumbs waiting for stuff to happen. I've downloaded all the syllables (syllabi?) from my classes I can, transferred and downloaded my transcripts, sent my FAFSA, paid for things like applications and graduation fees, and already got a living place started in the process before July.

Also, purely hypothetical, but would a college be unlikely to take me if I failed to complete the application process the first time I applied? I need to move near there, get my address changed, and all that stuff first. I'm hoping I can get that sorted out before actually starting classes.

501,Drop My Minor & Graduate Early or Graduate in the Spring (2024)?,11m0blq,"Hey everyone! Just have a quick question that’ll help determine the rest of my time here in undergrad.

I’m currently a Marketing major with a concentration in Marketing Analytics. I decided to pick up a minor (Writing, Rhetoric, and Digital Studies) last year because I was genuinely interested in it. Unfortunately, a lot of the courses I needed became completely unavailable (were no longer offered).

As a result I decided to just go back to having just my major until my dad suggested I minor in OSCM. Currently taking a class for it now and it’s definitely not something I want to continue.

The plan was to graduate in Dec 2023, but with the minor I’d have to stay until May 2024 (which was my original graduation date before I got ahead.)

If I drop the minor it’ll help my parents save a TON of money as 1.) I’ll no longer be a Resident Advisor and have cheap housing and 2.) My parents will have to pay for 1 semester instead of 2 if I graduate early because I’ll only have 3 more classes to take.

Just wanted to get some advice on what I should do. My dad wanted me to do it because it sounded like a cool pair and “would make me more marketable”, but I absolutely hate it and am 99.9% sure I don’t want to go into anything Operations & Supply Chain related.

Should I graduate in December and just keep it moving, drop the minor but try to spread out 3 courses throughout the entire school year, or keep the minor and just graduate in May 2024?

Thanks so much!

503,"About to graduate, realizing I choose the wrong major. What do I do?",11ltaux,"I (F 22) am a senior general engineering major, I graduate in May and I am on track to get my engineering degree. I have had 3 engineering internships, all of which I have been miserable in. I can find joy in just about anything, but the work I do is not fulfilling. And I’m bad at it.

What I do love, is music and large scale productions. I have directed choirs throughout college, helped put on student productions, mixed music for events, and arranged acapella pieces. And I’m pretty good at it! I’m not an amazing musician, but I’m creative and good at working with untrained performers. I love coordinating events with large amount of people in performances, and directing said events.

I thought about getting a music degree or a theatre degree, but both my parents have masters in music in and are now doing different, non-music things because they got burnt out. This caused me to go a different route, scared I would regret a music degree. I didn’t think I would be at the level to perform real theatre either, so I stayed away from that (even though I might have actually had a shot).

I have such a passion for production in general, I pour my heart and soul into creative tasks, and I just don’t feel any passion for engineering work.

Problem is, I’m getting married in May as well. My wonderful fiancé (also an engineering major) already has a job locked down in a smaller city with the plan that I would do remote technical writing for an engineering firm, because there are very limited jobs for engineering here. Now that I’m coming to the realization after three internships that I may not like what I’m doing, I am hitting a quarter life crisis.

Do I buckle down and work a miserable engineering job? Do I get a teaching certification and try to teach children’s choir or theatre? Would they even want an engineer? I thought it would be smart to keep my hobby separate from my job, but I just don’t think I’m that kind of person. The countless times crying in professors office saying I didn’t want to be an engineer should’ve been assigned a switch majors, but I tried to stick it through.

During this time, I was just so exhausted from the amount of homework, Id always procrastinate because Id just hate doing it if it wasn't something I was 110% interested in. 

I did end up graduating high school just barely, and decided to attend a local community college because it was just ""something you have to do"". And it just felt like I was in high school all over again, professors slowly reading from PowerPoint slides and being so unengaging and monotone, it drove me nuts. 

There is actually no reason why I am going. Even my parents said I didn't have to go, they've always noticed how much I've struggled in academia in comparison to my siblings. I just have this very limited mindset that if I don't go I will be a ""failure"" and that there is no way of having a good life without a college degree, I know this is wrong but its very much internalized.

561,I’m not smart enough to be great,11l9ob3,"
Growing up I was told I was very smart and I had a lot of potential. I wasn’t good sports, I was a chunky kid, and I wasn’t popular either. Therefore I took a lot of pride in being smart. 

When I was in high school I never studied for test but I’d still pass most of the time. I did strongly believe, at the time, that it if I were to study and put in the effort I could achieve good grades.

When I got into college because I didn’t know how to study I didn’t perform well at all. I’d find myself cramming for exams, giving up becoming a doctor changing to a diff major and just really tired.

In the second semester of my second year I decided to push myself to see what I was a capable of when trying my best and I got a 4.0. Gen Chem one a class I once dropped I ended getting a 95 in Gen Chem II.

Following that I believed that if I put in the effort I could achieve anything. I was wrongly mistaken. 

In my junior(currently) I find myself studying for exams harder than ever and continuously getting terrible grades. I checked in with tutors and other people and they say my study strategies are actually good. Which means it’s me I’m the problem.

I have come to realize the only reason I was able to get that GPA was because the classes during that semester weren’t hard. I was a fool to believe that I could achieve anything as long as I work hard.

Everytime in class I always feel lost. Meditation, journal and even exercise plus I put in a ton of effort yet I always fall short. The results are either mediocre or I fail.

I didn’t know her salary until yesterday. She also said it’s ridiculous I’m trying to get merit aid because “you want money for doing what you’re supposed to do in school” (despite later saying she’d think I was crazy if I didn’t try). Despite knowing I’d go to college, she never saved up for me, which I’m not mad at her for but I’m screwed if this is how she acts about finances in general. I’m really scared she’s not going to fill out the FAFSA because she hates talking about finances and seems to think it’s not even worth trying to get financial aid, despite most of the net price calculators I’ve entered her financial info into saying I’d still get a lot of aid. But if I can’t get her to fill out the FAFSA, I can’t get any of that, and it’s becoming increasingly likely she might refuse to fill out the FAFSA.

I don’t know. Is there some weird super niche side gig I can get into to pay for college? Like, feather dusting dog paws or something??

Military isn’t an option because I have disabilities that would disqualify me from serving. If it means anything, I have a 3.8 GPA, I’m going to take the SAT soon and am aiming for at least a 1500.

Another than that, I also preferred online and remote classes because recorded lectures were easier for me to learn. I could slow down or speed up the video, skip the useless parts, or repeat the important parts as much as needed.

(probably my phone in my car) and attendance is necessary, and I’m not sure if I’ll have to do presentations with slides etc. But being with a professor during a live meeting might be better for personal growth.

Financially, it isn't a big deal for various reasons, so that's not a huge factor.

My reasoning is I missed out on a lot of the college experience from covid. For three semesters, I was either stuck at home or stuck in my dorm room. In the past couple semesters, I finally got to experience some fun extracurriculars and start really making new friends. I also switched majors and had to take on a more intense course load in order to try and graduate on time so my fun time has been limited. An extra semester would let me take some fun classes I wanted to take but couldn't, bring up my GPA a bit, keep participating in clubs, and give me more time to look for a job.

On the other hand, I don't know if I'm just scared of life after college and am postponing it for that reason. I'm also scared of being graduated and jobless. And I know there's no real reason other than my own desire to have fun to take another semester.

I didn’t make any friends or talk to anyone, but i was able to attend class and get work done even if i was completely alone.I didn’t know eating in a dining hall alone could hurt. My parents are really big on education, and honestly i do a lot of it for them. i know this is wrong but i also know that it is the only way that i can reasonably make any money. 

it was at their dismay, when i chose to go home in the middle of the year, and not continued my second semester at this school. i felt like i was paying for something that i didn’t enjoy, and that i could get cheaper elsewhere and they agreed. i started looking for summer classes as well as transfer options, when i discovered something that ruined my life. My current bill for that one semester was over 20 thousand dollars. It seems that it’s not a mistake, because when i check the website, it says that it removed over 10 thousand dollars due to financial aid. still, that is a significant amount to pay for just one semester. and i know my parents can’t afford it.

I’m currently at home right now, working until the summer where i will take summer classes, but i don’t know if i can even do that because the school that i went too is holding my transcript until i pay the bill. I don’t know how it happened, i think it was a case of not looking deep enough into it when i was accepting schools. i want to go to college and finish my four year degree, but i just don’t know what i can do if i can’t get my transcript.

I genuinely want to die, maybe not that far, but if i died right now i think i would be okay with it. it feels like my life is over before it even started. i’m 18, all my friends are currently in school furthering their education while i have debt that i haven’t told my parents about. i feel like i let them down and that is what kills me, i don’t deserve to be their child. i’m drowning on the realities of life before i even turned 20.

Does anyone know of anything that i can do, my family is quite poor, so at most schools that i apply for, i usually max out the financial aid. which makes me even more confused as to how this happened. is my life over? is there anything that i can do? i just want to go to college and get a job and start working to pay off my debt, but that doesn’t look like an option for me. please help me.",Odd_Examination8251,1,1,0.67

I go to a state school that has gotten in some pretty hot water over the past couple of years over scandals with faculty. Since my enrollment here in 2021, we've had four separate faculty members get in trouble with the law for issues including fraud, harassment and even threats of violence. Two of these faculty have had weapons removed from their home and restraining orders placed by campus.

I've had issues with this school from the beginning and as these controversies come to light I wonder whether or not it's worth carrying on and graduating with a degree from here. It's become a real sore spot for me and I've avoided talking with my family about it because of how embarrassing it is. I'm considering whether or not I should take a semester off and use that time to transfer to another school.

However, I have only about a year left of my bachelor's. The college I'm currently at has a pretty good study abroad program which I've been considering for next semester not to mention I'd probably be looking at 2025 if I graduated anywhere else. On the other hand, it'd really weigh on my psyche if I graduated here.

However Temple's marketing program is a decent amount behind MSU's. With MSU I'd be going to a really good business program, and a company I'd really like to work for, Deloitte, hires a lot of people from MSU.

If you can share any similar experiences feel free to do so and if you have any advice please share. The post will probably be pretty long, TLDR at the end. Also excuse my English, its not my first language.

After my exams, for which I busted my ass off, I managed to get accepted into an electrical engineering university (in Greece). I passed 3/6 courses the first semester and Im attending the second semester. I chose this degree because I know that it has good future and job prospects.

The truth is that as of right now, I just dont like it. I like neither digital design (that course about logic gates, flip flops etc. I dont know what its called in English) nor engineering desing/drawing.I have always been good at math and I really like it. And although I have minimal experience in programming, I find it interesting. Reallistically the only courses I actually enjoy/ed are Calc I/II, Linear Algebra and Programming. I cant sit through even 2 consecutive lectures without being bored to death. And when I get home I cant get myself to study with zeal and even a bit of enthusiasm. For example, whenever I hear anything about how anything inside a computer works I think ""Ok thats cool bro. I just dont really care"". But I do know that maybe its a bit early to judge.

I have thought about changing degrees from EE to math but I dont know if it is the right choice. Is it maybe too early to pull the trigger? Did I really work this hard last year to throw it away and just go into math (it is SIGNIFICANTLY easier to get accepted to a math degree in Greece)?

The problem is that I dont know what the future will be like if I do study math. If anyone knows what prospects it has and what fields of work I can get into, your insight would be really appreciated.

TLDR: I am attending the second semester of electrical engineering and I dislike it. I like math but I fear that maybe its too early to judge EE and change degree to math and that it is a bad choice because the job prospects for math just arent as good.",Shudderer,0,2,1.0

617,Is it worth it to work while college?,11jvbzp,"I'm an indonesian college student majoring in graphic design (or visual communication design as it's called here). Currently on my second semester. I live with my parents, and (as pathetic as it sounds) they pay for my college funds and art supplies. My mother was talking aboht whether or not i want to get a job (whether or not ""i'm ready""). I've been doing a lot of thinking about it. It would be worth it to get money, but i'm not sure if i could handle botb a job and college. Considering graphic design is very heavy on the assignments, and there are multiple people who are either absent or had to retake because of a job.

The way my brother talked to me about it, seems like he expected me to get a job relating to design work which would effectively double the amount of things to do, saying something along the lines of ""no way a graphic design student would take a job like sales"". And he seems to be somewhat expecting me to get a full time job (8-5 is the standard here). I take the night classes because i'm not very good at waking up early. So i thought that if i were to take a full time job while college, that would leave me with barely any time to do assignments, and to relax. I would have to wake up early and get to work, right after work i would immediately leave for college, and then after college it would already be 10 pm, at best i get 2 hours of assignemnts to do. 

Part time job seems to be the better option here, though they are hard to find here. And i have a pretty bad time management skills. (+some of the students who retook classes are also working part time, so it may not have the best result)

So i told my mom that i'm not ready for a job (until i could maybe find a suitable part time job, that is), and she's pretty ok with it (though seemingly disappointed). My brother on the other hand doesn't agree with my decision (it's probably because i haven't told them about the possibilities of me working part time yet). He said that if i don't get a job now it would be hard for me to get a job in the future. I'm not certain if this is true or not. So now i'm worried.


It is also worth noting that my first semester (no job) was not the best. It was a bit foo stressful. It was so bad that i fell into an existential crisis. My mental health isn't the best, and that's the thing i'm most worried about.

As far as I have seen all applications are on a subscription basis with limited function if you use it free. For example ""Drawboard"" would be perfect, but you can't even draw on the pdf when you use the free version..

626,Is it worth appealing this grade?,11jum6d,"I have an engineering class. The professor is very strict when it comes to naming our assignments. So far I don't think I've messed up with that specifically.

With the most recent assignment, I was confused about the directions for naming it. Normally, each file is named a certain way, and we put them all in a zip file with a certain naming convention. The rubric had the instructions for naming the ZIP file as usual (which seemed dated, as this was our fourth assignment yet the naming convention example was named as if it was our third), but it didn't have instructions for the individual files. Seeing as it was close to the due date I went ahead and submitted it basically naming it how I wanted to. 

I ended up getting a D on the project (and missing extra credit) for improperly naming it. Should I appeal it? There are several factors in this.

-I still have an A in the class

-I don't know if I should reach out to the professor or the grader (syllabus doesn't specify)

-I could just be dumb and missed instructions. I did read the assignment multiple times but maybe I still missed it. And who knows maybe there was an in-person announcement or email that I missed.",wt_anonymous,9,0,0.5

639,Switching my major 3 years in?,11jfk9e,"Hi everyone, I’m new to the sub. I am currently a junior in college and it has gotten increasingly prevalent in my recent time in college that I am not as motivated towards my major. When I first started as a freshman, I was majoring in Plant Sciences and minoring in Biotechnology. I was very passionate about it and excited. I wasn’t sure what career I wanted though.

My sophomore year I ended up switch my major and minor, so now majoring in Biotech and minoring in Plant Sciences. Biotech was something that really interested me. I had thoughts about doing research, but was more so wanting to teach biology to high school students (I know I don’t need to major in these to teach, I was just very interested in the subject matter).

Well now this fall semester I have noticed my grades have gotten way worse. And I have also noticed my motivation has gone down A LOT. And the thought of pursuing science didn’t excite me anymore. But I thought well, im already 3 years in I kinda have to just finish, right?

Well I brought this up to my therapist and I told her if I could go back I would have probably gone to art school, and that I mainly chose science because it was the “safer” route and I feared judgement from my parents honestly. My therapist told me that I should switch my major, even if I’m already 3 years in, if it means I’ll be more motivated and happier. 

I guess I would feel like the last 3 years in school were a waste if I give up now. But I also would really rather go to art school. I am also scared of what my parents would think. So what are y’all’s opinions? Because science and art are completely opposite, I’m not sure how switching my major at this point would affect how much more school I would do. Is it worth it? 

TLDR; I am 3 years into college and I’m not passionate about my major anymore, wanting to switch to art but I am currently in a science degree. Scared of judgement from my parents and feels like the last 3 years would be a waste if I switch now. Thoughts?",graceam6,3,1,0.6

""**S**"" will be the friend we are moving in with

Ok so our friend group is essentially made up of two triple rooms + one friend from a different room, and we've been a close knit friend group since we started at our school. Now, it's getting close to the time where we have to decide where we want to live next year, and our only options are quads, which means getting a new roommate, so we thought **S** would be a great choice since her vibe and living habits mesh the best with the way my roommates and I live, so we asked her to live with us. 

Unfortunately, what we forgot about at the time, was the fact that our friend **T** is really sensitive about being left out, to the point where if any one of us make them feel like they've been excluded they shut down and ignore everyone, even those of us who weren't involved. 

**T** is a good friend, and we all enjoy their company when they are in a good mood.... we just don't want to live with them. Which brings us to the real problem: how do we break the news to **T** that **S** is going to be living with us next year?

I really only have one close (close as in I would feel comfortable telling him pretty much anything) friend in college, and I feel awful saying this, but our friendship doesn’t even compare to most of mine from before college.

I had a pretty eye opening experience tonight. Me and a few friends from high school, who I hadn’t really talked to in months, all got on discord tonight and just played some random games and talked. It was really crazy not only how I almost instantly felt comfortable with them like I was still spending almost every day with them, but also how much I just enjoyed myself compared to spending time with my friend(s) in college.

I honestly rarely have ever enjoyed just hanging out and talking with anyone in college, so I only really like hanging out to do some activity. But tonight I spent like 6 hours straight just talking without the conversation ever feeling dull or feeling bored at all. When I talk to my friends in college, I’ll often feel the exact opposite.

I’ve been thinking so much about what is so different with my friends from high school but I can’t really figure it out. None of us really shared many of the same hobbies, but that didn’t make hanging out with them any less fun. I went to the same school from kindergarten until I graduated high school, so maybe it’s because I’d known many of them for most of my life. I just can’t put my finger on exactly what makes me enjoy myself with them so damn much.

I was worried before I went to college that I wouldn’t make any close friends, and sadly it feels like that’s turning out to be true. I feel so damn alone never actually having anyone I enjoy spending time with for most of the year while I’m at school. Even when I’m with other people at college, it doesn’t make me feel any less lonely. It sucks because I know soon we’re just going to go back to spending months without ever really talking.

Every class we have a discussion but when we break into groups no one talks to me and I just participate when we reconvene and my professor asks the questions to the class. On one hand I don’t care what people think since I don’t have any friends anyways but for some reason it crosses my mind and I do get self conscious if I am just that annoying girl in class.",indie_spacegirl,24,57,0.91

(If not allowed, let me know... I'm new here!). The line goes to a voice mailbox where you can leave a message talking about your experience with student loans and what the future of loan forgiveness (or not) would mean for you: **(202) 932 - 9878.**

I shared about how loan forgiveness has enabled me to pay off my own unexpected medical bills, and how student loan forgiveness would allow me to dream a little bigger than my current day job. It has been a goal of mine to buy an old laundromat, fix it up, and turn it into a clean and peaceful place where anyone can go to not only do their laundry, but get connected with local community resources to support themselves and their families. This, in honor of my mother who unexpectedly passed away of an undetected, treatable disease during my first year of college. 

I remember the day she paid off her student loans, she literally skipped to and from the mailbox when she dropped that last check in the mail and announced it proudly to my sister and I with happy tears. I hope other people will decide to share their stories  too- I wouldn’t typically post about this but it was surprisingly helpful to say this out loud and feel like someone was taking the time to listen.

I'm a 17-year-old high school junior and I have two questions that I've been struggling to find the answers for. Firstly, I've been thinking about what I want to major in college and what I want to choose as a career later on, I've been thinking about this for a really long time since I was about 13 or 14, and my interests and who I am as a person changed a lot and I've changed what I wanted to pick as a major a lot so now I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself especially since I'll have two years in college to decide what I want to major in. I'm interested in the humanities in general, like philosophy, English literature, art, and history, but I don't know how I'll find a good job with a humanities degree or even a job that will let me do what I like which if I'm being honest I still don't quite know what that is yet and if anyone can give me some tips on how I can find that out it would be great. I've been considering double majoring in college, majoring in what I like and the other major would be in something practical and that I can easily get a job with after I graduate from college. But for now, I want to be able to major in something that I love that I can find a job in after I graduate, a career that I love doing and also helps others in a way, but at the same time, I like being able to express myself a bit. Did anyone else go through the same thing when they were in high school? Also, the second question, how do I find which university I want to go to. I'm an international student and I want to study in the US, but the thing is that I can't seem to find the right university, I've been using websites to try and find results but it's not helping.

I had to take a break from the core prerequisites due to the pandemic and other things so when I got back to campus and took my first on-ground chemistry course ever. I was so excited to do the lab in person. I had taken chem before online but had to retake it because I didn't like my grade so this was incredibly exciting to perform an actual lab.

My lab partner is fresh out of high school so it's her first semester. She was also very excited to do the lab and I completely get that but she took complete control over the entire process, rushed through it and didn't believe my answers. Every single time she was unsure about what I was objecting to she'd ask the professor only then to be told that I was right. This happened with like every single question on the lab! She'd grab the wrong equipment and didn't believe me when I told her. She never acknowledged that she was making mistakes and was treating me like I was HER student and not her partner. She also bought and wore the lab coat that we don't need until the 4th lab and told me ""serious STEM majors are prepared"" in a real arrogant tone. 

I had never gotten to use a bunsen burner before and she just went ahead and started to use it but was sticking the match inside the top and hovering right over it.... when I was telling her to light it from the side and to lean away she was ignoring me. Well she turned the gas on too high and when she went to stick the match inside it almost burned her. So I pettily said ""I told you so."" Then she ordered me to grab the electronic balance and I said ""No I'm going to get the correct equipment. You're closer anyway."" I think that was a justified amount of slight attitude.

683,Dorming Dilemma with Neighbors who Can’t keep it down when they are intimate,11h9osf,"Hi! Im a freshman (19F) in college currently dorming in a freshman hall. The walls in my building are quite thin, you can over hear conversations, you can hear as little as someone burping, you can hear anything.

This issue started last semester.
Now where my problem comes from is when the girls in the room next to mine bring their boyfriends over. I have nothing against being sexually active in college, i myself am sexually active when I see my boyfriend. But the amount of noise I can hear when either of them have their boyfriends over is insane. I can hear the beds hitting against the wall or creaking, I can hear both parties being vocal. I can hear everything. 

During last semester, I started off by leaving a note, nothing aggressive, a simple “Hi, the walls are a bit thin. I can hear more than I think you’d want me to, just to lyk” kinda message. I then saw my letter was placed at someone else’s door, so I took it that my message was disregarded. Both of them continued on having loud sex, to which I reported it to my RA, because I honestly shouldn’t be hearing that at 2AM when im tryna sleep.
Today, at 12:45. NOON. I was hearing it again. I genuinely have no idea how to ask them to keep it down, because this isn’t something I want to be hearing in the middle of the day, or EVER really? I decided to leave another little note, but if that fails, I’m not sure what to do.

Disclaimer: I play video games a lot so I wear headphones at loud volumes, and I can STILL hear them, so headphones WONT work in trying to tune out their noise.

I am a freshman in college really confused on my future and a major to pick. I am interested in medical school and becoming a doctor yet I realize how hyper-competitive it is to get into medical school. To be honest, my GPA is way lower than the average high GPA accepted med students (major is currently biochem but am going to change). Unless I really up my game, I don't feel safe to get into med school whatsoever.

I know I can theoretically puck any major as long as I take the required core classes for med school. My ine doctor suggested I do a major I love, do well in the pre-reqs and the MCAT. I do like her advice. However, I am scared that this won't be good.

I am terrified that I pick a major I like, such as i.e. philosophy or neuroscience, and don't get into med school that my future is destroyed. Yes, I can go to grad school. But the majors I actually like do not have any real marketable skills or jobs available. So as much as I WANT to do a major I enjoy, my logical side is telling me not to because it is useless (unless I go to grad school). 

Anyways, what can be a good major? I was thinking of computer science but I realize it is hard and will not give me an extremely good GPA. But it is one of the best degrees to get and is flexible.

And, of course, biology degrees for example are completely useless and I hate labs - plus my doctor told me it's good to stand out with a different major. 

Any help is appreciated.

I am currently a bio major, but I want to go into culinary, more specifically baking. I plan on working at a bakery during the summer to either solidify or rethink about my feelings. I always joked about working at a bakery as a retirement job and as a kid, that’s what I wanted to do when I grew up. I even wrote my college essay about my baking passion LOL. My school unfortunately, does not have any culinary majors/minors so if I wanted to pursue culinary, I would have to drop out/switch schools. I currently attend a good university, and while I am absolutely grateful to be there and have my parents financially support me, I fear that college academic life doesn’t suit me. I feel like I am going through the motions of attending class because I have to (like following the parent to-do list) instead of wanting to get my degree so I can work in the bio field. Because of this, I don’t feel a lot of motivation to try my hardest in my classes and when it comes to writing, I dread it. I will say I don’t mind my labs, since I do like hands-on work. My traditional parents want me to get the degree as a ‘plan B’, and they don’t mind me switching majors as long as I finish my degree at that university. I understand they are worried and they want me to be financially independent adult and successful, but the stubbornness and perhaps naïvety makes me not want to compensate. I’m not sure how much longer I can keep my grades up to a passable level and this lack of motivation feels like I’m just being lazy. It’s also a little (VERY) stressful knowing if I want to pursue culinary, my parents won’t support me and they’ll never let go of the fact that I wasted the opportunity of being at such a nice school.

He's in my second language class and he just seems so arrogant to me. He's good at this language and it's because he's studied it for years before college. But he really loves showing off how good he is.

For example, our professor gives out a long reading each week that has all the new words we learned that week, and they'll call on each student individually to read it out loud. Now since none of us are fluent in this language, obviously people are going to make mistakes, and mistakes are encouraged in our class because that's how we learn.

But whenever someone does make a slight mistake in the pronunciation or something, the arrogant classmate immediately corrects them every. single. time. Usually people will correct themselves, but he so quickly talks over them that they don't get a chance to. Sometimes during these readings, when he's not called on, he'll still read the passage out loud to himself while the other person is also reading.

Today he did this to me, and it made me so angry that I didn't want to talk for the rest of class because had he done it to me again I'd have yelled at him, and I don't want that. It affected my participation grade, obviously. But I don't want this to keep affecting me. How do I manage it?

706,"My ""friend"" plagiarized my work without me knowing",11gadni,"I'll cut to the chase:

This guy that sits next to me in history class.  We have 5 essays due for our midterm.  He asks to see my essays, but I try to dodge the question.  He later tells me his uncle died.  On the day of the midterm, he calls me and asks to see my essays. I asked him if he already did them, and he said yes.  I figured he just wanted to look through it before he submitted his final paper.  He said he copied a ""couple sentences"" but reworded them.  I'm not a fan, but whatever.  This was Tuesday and the essays were submitted online - no class that day.  We had 75 minutes to submit them, but we were allowed to pre-write them.  I have suspicions the guy lied to me and just straight-up copied my essay.

Today is Thursday.  I see him before class and he tells me he's not attending.  He normally attends every class.  I grow worried that this guy got caught and downplayed the reality of the situation.  I ask the guy who normally sits next to him and he basically told me that on Tuesday he came to him for desperate help and he didn't prewrite his essays.  He then proceeds to help this guy for 75 minutes and help him reword/rewrite the essay as much as he can.  He said he copied a lot and it wasn't good.  I ask him to forward me the essays that he wrote.  I ran them through a text compare and this guy basically word for word copied 30% of my essay, and changed super minor stuff for another 30% of my essay...

&#x200B;

I never permitted him to straight up copy me.  He told me he already wrote his essays so I thought he was just using it to ""double-check"" or make very minor improvements to his essays.  I didn't think he'd actually basically just copy and paste my stuff.  I'm highly suspicious he got caught because he seemed flustered today and didn't really provide a reason as to why he wasn't attending class.  For note, this guy also copied the other guy's essay too (the one that sits next to him).  What do I do if I'm called down to the office? Can this go on my permanent record? What are consequences? I'm scared.

&#x200B;

Update: The professor just emailed me stating that a large portion of my essay is similar to that submitted by another student. The ""friend"" also got the same email.

The Professor asked if I could explain. I told him that I'd like to request a meeting with him. I did not admit to anything over email, I heard this was the smarter thing to do.

Me and the guy agreed that we'd comeforth honestly about the situation. At first he wanted to lie and say that we used a ""tutor"" for help. I told him that was a stupid idea and there's no shot he'd believe it at all. Especially if a large chunk of our essays are literally word for word. I got him to change his mind and just to come forth honestly. I'm going to say that he told me he was already done with the essays and submitted them, and that he just wanted to ""read"" what I wrote (or something of the sorts) because I told him that I can write really solid essays and was confident in this assignment. In no way did I actually want him to actually copy my work. The professor also knows that this kid's uncle died and was going through a hard time. I can tell the professor he told me the same story and I felt super bad for him. I have text messages of him saying he already did the work and wasn't going to copy and that his uncle died.

Does anyone have any advice on how I'm intending to handle the situation? Am I screwed completely? I'm a Pre-Dental student and don't want to throw away my life because of this. Can I argue that it was a misunderstanding? Should I tell him that he should just tell the professor he looked at my laptop and took a picture, while I was in the bathroom?

&#x200B;

FINAL UPDATE: I told the Professor the truth.  We called on the phone and I explained the situation and he was totally understanding of the situation.  No consequences or anything, he just said to have it as a lesson learned and not trust anyone with your work.  He said his wife had a colleague who plagiarized her work.  I'm not sure what's going to happen to the kid, but that's his problem now.  This is a lesson learned for sure.  I'm glad I was honest with him.  Thank you guys so much.  I can finally sleep at night.

Background: Last summer, I spoke with a girl and we decided to room together at school. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out and she moved out of the dorm, taking my friend group with her. I have had a single ever since she moved out (around 3-4 months ago). 

I had another friend who was going to dorm with me next year, but she got invited to room with another group of girls and she decided to room with them. I don’t have many friends here, and although I try my hardest to be friendly to everyone I meet, I have two friends who already have their housing situations set up.

Two girls I know invited me to room with them next year, but they would be on the other side of the quad room. I’m a bit apprehensive about rooming with someone random - after my first experience with a roommate I am nervous about getting along with someone I don’t choose, but I also know I can’t afford to be picky and can’t push everyone away.

It has always been important for me to graduate on time, and I've tried my hardest to ensure that will happen. Unfortunately, because of a silly mistake I made last week, I might have to stay an extra semester.

So here is the lowdown: I am a violin performance major, for some context here. As a music major, one of the biggest credit requirements is to be part of a large ensemble for all 8 semesters. In my case, that would be orchestra. This has never been an issue for me, I love orchestra and would take it every semester even if it wasn't a requirement. It wasn't an issue until I made this stupid mistake. Basically, last week we had a concert. And to make a long story short, I screwed up and didn't show up until 5 minutes before the concert started. I'd had a stressful week, my dad had just undergone heart surgery (he's fine by the way, the surgery went well, but we were all still stressed and overwhelmed) and I just wanted some time before the concert to de-stress. So I hung out in a room by myself until the concert started. I lost track of time and then finally went out to go on stage just 5 minutes before start time. Then I was told I would not be allowed to perform due to being late.

I explained the situation to my parents and they helped me calm down and reminded me that everyone makes mistakes. I knew the mistake I made was particularly large because not only did I let down my team, but this would also result in a failing grade. And I have never failed a class before, let alone a class like orchestra so this was a pretty big deal.

Fast forward to today. A few hours ago I had a one-on-one discussion with my orchestra director about how to move forward from all this. I was hoping he would allow me to do a make-up assignment so I wouldn't fail the course (even though this wasn't exactly a family emergency as the surgery was scheduled and we knew it would be happening, it was still overwhelming and I was hoping he would at least give me another chance because of the circumstances) and though he was respectful and understanding, he unfortunately didn't let me make the grade up. He told me it was because in the real world if this happens I would be fired. This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to hear, but I understood and I respect that decision.

So now basically my only options are to drop the course or take the F, neither of which would give me credit for the semester for orchestra but at least dropping would mean it wouldn't affect my GPA, and then I wouldn't be kicked out of the music program. Now I've never had to drop a class before (and I never would have guessed my first withdrawal would be orchestra, of all classes) but if I did, normally I wouldn't worry too much about it since I could just retake it the following semester. But with orchestra, since I need all 8 semesters of credit for that class, not getting credit for it one semester would mean, you guessed it, I would fall behind and have to push my graduation back.

I will likely end up having to drop since I would much rather stay another semester and still get my music degree than get kicked out of the program. Generally I've managed to keep a good GPA and I've never been on the verge of academic probation. I even made dean's list my first two semesters. I am definitely not the straight A 4.0 type of person, but I've always managed to get reasonably good grades. So this is new territory for me that is heavily weighing on my mind.

Also, I will be the first to say that I am privileged, my parents are paying my tuition (another reason why this whole mistake is making me feel guilty) and I realize not everyone has parents who can afford to pay for their education. I don't want my privilege to turn me into a spoiled brat, and I do my best to not take it for granted. I love my parents and appreciate everything they do for me, and all they want for me is to do my best and pursue what makes me happy.

Anyways, with all this being said as much as I don't want to have to stay an extra semester, I am trying to tell myself that it's not a bad thing. Many people take longer than 4 years to graduate, and it would be much better than taking the F and getting kicked out. I won't drop the course yet, I'm going to talk to my advisor about my options before going through with the withdrawal. I will update this post if anything worth updating comes out of it.

I'm sorry this post was very long haha, but I hope it sparks some discussion if any of you reading this have gone through or are going through something similar.

TLDR: Missed my orchestra concert because I messed up and showed up late, now I'm taking a huge L and might not graduate on time. Actions have consequences.",DanielaThePialinist,6,4,0.84

739,"Students - Just in case you didn't know, more than 50% of your university's professors are probably adjunct/part-timers.",11f6kjq,"I'm pointing out the following because students are paying more for college than they ever had before, taking on massive amounts of debt, and have high expectations (as they should) but many of the people they're relying on are being exploited because there is a surplus of faculty, Universities don't want to take on more full-time employees, and the full-time employees don't want more colleagues because there is a limited pot of resources.  All adjunct faculty have advanced degrees, many of them have PhDs or MFAs.  Many have real-world experience, working in their industries as professionals - that's what the original intention of an adjunct was.  An adjunct would teach one or two classes in a specialized field that allowed them to bring in that real experience or teach a special subject that they became a master in.

However, adjuncts now are stop-gaps for universities who have more students than full-time faculty, and as a result, adjuncts have become a separate class of professors who have the same expectations as full-time professors but a fraction of the compensation and few supporting resources.

According to a number of organizations that track university employment, the current rate is about 55% of university professors are part time employees (adjuncts).

This means that:  
1) Your professor is probably making $3000-$5000 PER CLASS for the whole semester (thats $750-$1250 per month).  Most of them are avoiding living in poverty by working multiple jobs.  
2) Your adjunct professor is probably teaching at multiple universities.  Most adjuncts who are attempting to be full-time teachers are working at 2/3/4 institutions.  That means they're traveling constantly from school to school, don't have the time to stay around before or after class, and they're probably teaching 40+ students per school, so they could have 80/120/160 students.  
3) Your professor has so much out-of-class work to do that they're not doing research or field work.  They're instructors and not researchers.  
4) Most introductory coursework (Intro classes, general education courses, university pre-reqs) are being taught by adjunct faculty.  Most full-time faculty don't want to teach intro classes, they want to teach specialized upper-level courses, so many of the professors teaching your first classes you'll never see again.

5) Adjunct professors are usually not required to attend department meetings, depending on what kind of labor rules is in place.  They're often not required to hold office hours, conferences, or outside-of-class support offerings.  Many professors literally hold ""office hours"" while they're walking to their cars, or do it from their trunk.  


When you look at the schools you want to go to, are going to, or if you plan to become a university instructor yourself, understand that this is a real problem in college that you don't hear about.  If you're frustrated with a professor, ask them if they're a full-time professor or part time.  Full-time professors usually teach 3-4 classes, but the university's expectations of them is that, in return for a light teaching load and good compensation (good compared to adjuncts), the professor will produce publications, conduct research, provide institutional service, mentor students, and continue to be masters of their field.  Adjunct faculty have been asked to do much of this also, at a fraction of the compensation and without any support to do these things.  If you're in the process of picking a school, look at who the faculty are at the university.  Look at the department rosters and see how many are part time vs. full time.  Some schools have departments with 70%+ part-time faculty.  You may get an instructor that is really good, that you really enjoy working with and learn a lot from, but will not be able to take another class with them beyond introductory classes because adjunct faculty rarely teach upper level coursework.",KayoshiStoryteller,173,560,0.97

This is my first semester at the new school. I went from being an IS major in an ABET accredited program in the same department as the CS program at my old school to an IS/T program in the business college at this new school which is AASCB accredited. There is some difference in program rigor, but I thought maybe I could take some CS electives and make up for it. I figured the difference in aid made it worth it.  

This school is starting to feel like it’s not for me. I have struggled to get my transfer credit eval done and communicate with advisers. I took some classes toward their business core while I waited on credit for my old school to be evaluated for equivalency, and they denied most of my important credit like comp sci classes. I’m worried this degree is just going to end up being way too business oriented and not enough of the tech side, although I very much know that IT or IS does not = CS. I don’t want to major in CS because this is just not something I want to do. 

The extra scholarships are possibly renewable, but not guaranteed. I don’t want to delay my graduation, but I’m just worried this program isn’t what I want to spend my time, effort, and possibly student loans on if I do not get aid again.

7,"A college ""corrected my FAFSA"" and now my EFC is higher- what do I do?",11ahn18,"Hey everyone! So I am a high school senior, and I have a twin brother who is also a high school senior. We both did our FAFSA in November. Last month, we were talking about college and he mentioned his EFC and pell grant amounts. I was shocked to see that he was eligible for nearly double the pell grant amount than I was, even though we had the same numbers!

This led to us comparing our FAFSAs line by line, and we found one line (a single line!!!!! ughhhh) that I had screwed up. I quickly corrected that line and it said I now had an EFC and pell grant much closer to what he had.

Unfortunately, this triggered the verification process for every college I applied to. I had to send tax forms and information about the people in my house to these colleges. After that, everything seemed to be good. One of my colleges (the one I think I want to go to) sent me an updated award letter that reflected the new pell grant amount.

But last week, I got an email from the FAFSA website that ""a college submitted a correction to your FAFSA"" and it now shows my EFC from before I made the correction. And then yesterday, this college updated their award letter again back to what it was originally. I know I am eligible for a lower EFC because my twin brother has a lower EFC and we used the same numbers. I am not trying to cheat the system, I just made an honest mistake, and I obviously want to get all of the aid I am eligible for because my family is broke asf

The one question I corrected on the FAFSA was not to do with income or tax information. It was ""how many people in your household will be attending college in 2023-24"" or something like that. I must have misread the question to not include myself, so I put 1. But it was supposed to be 2 because me and him are both going to college next year. If a college did not look at my verification and just automatically rejected it, this question should be easy to prove because my twin brother also submitted a FAFSA form and applied to colleges (many of which I also applied to!) so obviously he is also planning to attend college next year.

So what steps should I take? I emailed the federal student aid contact email and the office of financial aid of the college I mentioned that changed my award letter, but I have not heard back from either of them yet. Is there anything else I should do? I want to make sure I do everything I can to get this aid that I know I am eligible for.

17,How else to deal with a disruptive/confrontational student?,11ad8yg,"Just started attending college again at the age of 27. In one of my classes there is a student who is very disruptive to the rest of the class. Based on his behavior I'm assuming he is still in the high school tough guy mindset. He comes in about 30 minutes late and whenever he disrupts the teacher to ask a question he is yelling his question. He never actually does anything, he just shows up for attendance and sits there. I usually just ignore him since I am there to learn.

Today during class I went to the rest room and on the way back this student was also going to the restroom. Instead of moving out of each others way he shoulders me(to assert dominance I assume). I just looked at him and moved on. During class I can tell he's now fixated on me and trying to antagonize me by saying stuff under his breath. At the end of class he gets up from his seat and is standing almost behind me, so when I get up to leave my chair backs into him. I apologize and proceed to try to walk out the class. At this point I know he is targeting me to get some sort of reaction. Somehow he ends up in front of me blocking the doorway so I politely say excuse me and walk past him. As I walk past he makes an uppercut gesture behind my back that I caught, so I ask if he's okay and he proceeds to get loud and aggressive saying, ""You're good bro!""

30,Is this what college is supposed to be like? (ranting),11a5jsr,"So I'm in the 2nd semester of my 1st year of college. I go to a local D3 college in the town over about 10 minutes away from my house. Social life here is utter garbage. I have no close friends, but I do have a decent amount of normal friends, but not friends that you'd see on a daily basis or outside of school and whatnot. After the 2nd semester started, I'm only still seeing a few of those friends I made in the 1st semester, either because our schedules changed, or cause there was a bit of drama in my unorganized friend group so everyone kinda went in their own directions. I'm not in any clubs or societies or anything because I don't really have time to with work and other issues.

Classes here are terrible to be honest. Most classes you don't talk with or make friends with your classmates for the entire semester. Some of the professors here are ok but most of them are very unfriendly. Most times the professor will walk into class and not say hello or do anything to be friendly with the class, they just jump straight into the work and go on a lecture for the next hour and a half. Most of the classes I'm in are taught in a lecture style, where the teachers just go on and on about the subject we are learning, no questions being asked by the audience.

All of this stuff is kind of my fault tbh because I should have joined clubs or tried to be more friendly, but I have bad social skills so if I start talking to someone one day, I'll never see or interact with them again unless they approach me. I also have ADHD so focusing for the entire class is pure agony. I end up just going on my laptop and doing other stuff other than school work. I've just given up at trying to do well in class because I know that I'm gonna end up failing anyway, pretty much knew it from the 1st day of the new semester. I don't study, don't do assignments, completely screw up on tests, I've just stopped trying to improve. I'm not even in my major class anymore I've lost complete interest in it. I've never been to one of those senior seminar or college prep classes or whatever they are called. I've gone to one of those academic advisor meetings multiple times and it just feels like I'm getting lectured on what I'm supposed to be doing and how to do it, and whenever I want to ask a question I chicken out for some reason. I've gotten something called an action plan, which is a paper that has a list of things I should try to do to improve my GPA from the last semester (0.67). Idk if any other colleges have action plans and stuff.

This current school year has just felt like complete hell. I was hoping that coming here I'd be getting a full college experience, make a lot of good friends, find out what I wanted to do with my life, etc. Instead it's had the complete opposite effect. I basically have no more goals so I just feel like I'm coming here just for the hell of it. However, I think this is more of one of those 'college isn't for me' issues, because I could've avoided all of this mess I'm in if I put in effort to make change, but I didn't and now I'm paying the price. I'm currently writing this in my biology class because I cannot focus.

I still have about a year before I graduate and i’m not sure what i wanna do but i’m think about going to grad school and maybe going into fields related to public policy or urban planning.

I have always been a pretty good student (I was a valedictorian in high school), and most of my college classes have been fine and I've somewhat enjoyed them. However, I have a few classes that are killing me. I attempted one a few semesters ago, and it was a horrible experience. I couldn't understand anything like the other students could and I felt so stupid and so bad about myself. I ended up just taking the F and forgetting about it the rest of the semester to save my mental health. 

This is now happening again with one of my current classes, but it's twice as bad. I'm crying about this stupid class everyday now. I spend full days doing the homework and trying to understand things, but I can't. I don't have time for a tutor or to meet with the professor one-on-one. All I want to do is quit. I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety in the past, and these classes (especially my current one) are making me go downhill again, but I can't graduate unless I pass them.

I know everyone would look down on me if I dropped out of college, but is it okay to quit? I'm married and both my husband and I have really good part-time jobs (he's also going to school). I'm majoring in zoology because my goal in life is to start some sort of animal rescue, but I don't think you necessarily need a degree for that.

86,projected 80k in debt,1196ufz,"Before anyone gets upset or berates me, I was never taught anything about money or how to manage my finances, and I really want to start but I'm completely unsure how. My family and I lived in poverty until I was in high school when my parent got remarried and now we are middle class. My parents are from a 3rd world country and didn't know how debt worked but being from an ethnic family, not going to college was NOT an option. My other parent (estranged) is legally obliged to give me half a grand a month until I turn 21, but I have been notified that the payments will probably continue until I graduate. Usually this money goes to groceries and school supplies and I'm left over with average ~200 a month, but lately it has been hard to save up because I keep having emergencies. 

I'm a junior at my state university with my predicted graduation date in 2024 and I am doing an unpaid art gallery and museum internship with my school that hopefully will lead into a paid part time job. I am doing a fine arts degree that has given me the chance to exhibit and establish connections, and I have an academic minor in art history. 

Currently I have 60k in debt with a projection of 80k after interest and I have no idea how to start paying it off. I hope to get a full time job in gallery or museum work once I graduate with the experience I'm gaining right now. Is there a certain amount of money I should be setting aside per month to help me go towards the monthly payments once they start? Is 50-100 enough? Should I open a bank account that grows the savings via interest? I only have 1 account open which is why it is hard to maintain my finances. I don't have a credit card but I do have a very good credit score as I have been enrolled and paid off small things using those payment apps and programs online.

This school year things were going ok but I didn't really feel like the group I was with was where I was meant to be. Some bad stuff happened between me and a couple of people in the group about a month ago. I haven't talked to any of them since, even the people who weren't involved in the conflict. I'm not sad about it since I had spent some time debating on whether or not I wanted to stay in the friend group and this conflict really solidified that for me. Now I have no friends at all. I have people I talk to when I see them and my friends from high school who I talk to everyday, but I don't spend time with anyone.

106,BA Thesis on a topic I'm not familiar with,118w0rg,"Hello, everyone

I am a Romanian undergraduate student getting a degree in literature.

In our education system, one needs to write a 60-100 page thesis on a certain topic within their field in order to graduate, and we are advised to reach out to potential supervisors as early as possible in order to get our research in order.

I contacted one of my English literature professors with a list of topics pertaining to 20th century literature, and while she said that they are great proposals, she suggested that I should write about some contemporary authors instead. While I am eager to do this because it seems like an interesting opportunity, I have read none of the authors whom she listed, and I would have to start from scratch instead of relying on any prior knowledge.

I nailed fall semester. I made the Dean’s List, became secretary of my school’s Pre-Nursing Club, and was recommended to be a resident assistant for next school year.

Now, I’m in a downward spiral. This semester’s courses entail more rigorous assignments. For some of my courses, I enjoy the assignments and can complete them easily. For others, it takes more motivation and effort. Because of that, half of my assignments this semester have been turned in at least a day late— the rest on time.

My health hasn’t been the best either. My meal times are infrequent. I don’t drink enough water. I don’t exercise often anymore. Also, I have an irregular sleep schedule. 

Last of all, I fear that my professors think I’m stupid/ mental and I don’t care. My work ethic so far is terrible.

When they say ""research"", ik they mean researching something. That ""something"" is what I'm unclear about specifically.
Does that just mean the student thinks of some hypothesis or idea thats unstudied and spends that time on it? Or is it about taking something known and essentially redoing it? Or even taking something with limited study and continuing that?
Is there a system for a student to come up with one of these or is it just something ""random"" they've thought of? 

I'm a Chem major and my school sends out tons of information on available research oppurtinies, internships, programs, etc. I'm probably a long ways from participating in any of that(freshman) and I'll have 2 ""Directed Student Research"" ""classes"" when I'm a junior and/or senior.

Has anyone ever taken more than 18 successfully? I keep seeing everyone saying not to do it, but I want advice from someone who has a similar experience to mine.

The other one I do not think I’ll have as much fun in and it is more expensive(about a 3k difference). Also the school is not very diverse at all and I think I will not have a good social life. But it is also in the top 50 best colleges in the nation. I also have a fairly saturated and competitive major.

Fun school pros 
- potential better social life/ more diverse
- less expensive
- more of a modern school
-commute is shorter 

Fun school cons 
-parents won’t be as happy I transfer here
-Earn potentially 5k less
-will not look as good on resume as prestigious school will 

Prestigious school pros 
-Looks better on resume especially with a saturated major
-make more money out of college 
-parents will be happy I picked this college 

Prestigious school cons 
- school is in a isolated area
- not diverse/ bad social life

159,Considering Dropping Out/Taking a Break,11857vn,"Hey guys, I do not normally make posts on this platform but I need some advice from an outside perspective.

 (Freshman, 18)

The title explains what I would like to do, but my reasoning for it is not because ""I can't pass classes"" or that ""I am lazy"".

I have always been a hard worker and graduated high school in the top 1 percent of my class. I absolutely loved school and was excited to be a first generation student and make my family proud. My first semester of college went amazing and everything was smooth sailing until the end of it.

In November, I found out my Mom took her own life. I was devastated by this and everything in my life shattered. I finished out the semester and tried to recoup over break. I eventually started up my second semester and realized I cannot stay as focused anymore.

Do not get me wrong, I have all A's and one B currently doing just fine, but my mental health is on a rapid decline. My Dad has his own business, and my Mom used to help run the office side of things (billing, taxes, taking customer phone calls, filing, etc.) and he does the physical labor of the business.

He currently has no one to help him and does not know how he will be able to juggle being on the work site and dealing with the office responsibilities at the same time.

I recently decided that I want to drop out after this semester (My Degreeworks has showed I am already half way through my degree, which, I plan on changing but most of them are core classes anyways) and be able to retain the credits that I have gotten this year. 

I really want to take a break for my mental health and help out my Dad with the business. He has horrible body problems and I would also want to take care of him, the dogs, and the house when I can. I think it would be great work experience and potentially look great on a resume, but I do not want people to think I am a loser. My Dad supports me in every way as he has seen I have done nothing but worked hard in life.

I really feel horrible for accepting defeat, but I feel as if my mental health from this tragic event and bonding with my really only family member I have left is so much more important.",xSaeru,2,2,1.0

Part of the reason is because I go to bed too late (after 12). I tried to get to bed earlier, but my roommate is usually up until at least midnight. He has only afternoon classes, and midnight isn't that late, so I feel bad asking him to turn off his computer or be quieter since it's hard to sleep with his super bright screen and louder keyboard.

165,Flatmate just annoying or actually a safety hazard?,118175x,"Hi all, I'm at a university in the UK living in off-campus student accomodation and have been lumped in with 2 random flatmates. They're nice, however one of them is becoming quite concerning regarding their personal hygiene (or lack there-of).

Said flatmate will bulk buy chicken and seems to cook 3 breasts at a time, however will only eat 1. He then leaves the other 2 on the stove for up to 4 days at a time - just sitting there in a pot. He then just turns the stove back on as if he never left, cooks them again, and takes another. Then leaves the remaining again just sitting there on the stove another few days before repeating. All the while, the large tray of raw chicken is left sitting fully exposed in our fridge - no glad wrap or even a paper towel covering it. He does the same with other foods as well and the fridge obviously stinks.

We have separate bins and he took it upon himself to once use mine while I was on holidays (so there was no bag in the bin) and when I came back it was covered in mould. So had to throw it away and buy a new bin.

He also cooks a lot of indonesian food (where he's from) which regularly stinks up the flat. Every day I open our kitchen windows and turn on the induction fan to try and air it out, but he comes back in and closes the whole place up and turns the heating on 100%. He also insists on leaving the hallway door wide open while cooking. So whenever I get home, as soon as I enter my flat you can immediately feel the strong presence of thick air coated in the stench of his cooking. Can even smell it in my room often.

As I said, he's a nice guy and I don't think he intends to be such an asshole. But this is getting pretty disgusting and I am kind of concerned it's an actual sanitary/hygiene hazard.. Am no expert, so would be great if someone could please elaborate on what risks he may be imposing by doing all this.",DistinctHunt4646,1,6,0.88

During previous K-12 spring breaks, I either went on some vacation with my family to some city or state or something, or just chilled at home and did next to nothing at all (which is pretty much what I did during this winter break more or less).

As for particular destinations... this is gonna sound incredibly lame, but I don't really know if flying to some island in Florida and just chilling and partying on a resort would be particularly enjoyable (even though many of my ""friends"" from school do that all the time). Idk, I haven't actually done it. Well, maybe I do like it and just haven't tried it yet.

Issue is, I don't have a lot of irl friends who'd really want to go with me (nor did I during HS), and I'm not sure about money etc. since I've never actually held a real job (so all my money just comes from my parents). And I kinda feel guilty for saying this since they're clearly nice and care about me, but I feel like my parents can be a bit protective at times. They wouldn't even let me drive for a while, even after I passed my tests and all that. I understand they care for my safety and all that, and I see where they're coming from, but to be honest I feel like they really did kinda sap away a lot by micromanaging me.

My father said he might want to take me somewhere, like before. On one hand, ooh cool, I could go on what basically amounts to a free all-inclusive vacation. But then again, I'm a college freshman, and I'm pretty sure I'm a little old to be doing that?

I've never actually really gone anywhere far or overnight on my own with friends. To be honest I'm sure my parents are somewhat protective. Also, they've often yelled quite a bit at both me and my brother - it's tolerable enough that I'm still willing to return home regularly (I go to a college within pretty close driving distance of my hometown), especially since they're very willing to give me free food (including dining out), free money (including tuition!), and again, even free vacations, and that's very generous of them.

During our first semester of senior year, they lived together off campus, but still near campus. However, they had one major disagreement living together. Basically, the roommate smoked weed, which my girlfriend didn't care that she did, just not in the house if she wasn't going to air it out. The roommate never aired it out and the house smelled like weed for like 2 months. The roommate also had other people live with them rent-free without my girlfriend's consent. At that point, my girlfriend was fed up and after constantly telling her roommate to communicate with her and respect their shared space, the roommate blew up on my roommate and got her friends to come over and verbally attack her to the point where my girlfriend cried and went over to my place. At this point, she stayed with me for about a week. During this week, the roommate's friends called my gf on a No Caller ID as well as sent her an email under an alias under a different name. At that point my gf was fed up and called the school. The school didn't do anything, all they did is move her to a dorm for the rest of that semester. The leasing office also did not do anything, despite the complaints from us as well as the roommates neighbors. The campus police told us to contact the state police, and then the state police told us to contact the campus police. No one has helped.   


My girlfriend ended up getting a new apartment, but throughout of when my gf was moved to the dorms by the school, her now ex-roommate constantly kept posting about her on her Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. At first it was just saying things that were like ""okay whatever"" but then she escalated even further by posting things about me as well as my girlfriends mother. She actively has stalked our socials too. This all happened in October and it's FEBRUARY now. She still to this day constantly posts about us, but now she's escalated into using alt accounts to stalk my girlfriend's socials and repost them on her Twitter while making fun of us. She also has posted information about our sex life and other private things on social media WHILE USING OUR NAMES, so I created a document of all the things she did and said towards us and sent it to the school. They said they can't do anything, because technically she has 1st amendment rights, and she's allowed to post on her socials, because it's along the same lines like if she were gossiping about a celebrity or whatever.  


I'm lost. We both are. For four months we've faced constant harassment from this chick and her friends and nobody is doing anything.

There are some issues I am facing:

1. She is on her phone all day. She always talks about starting being productive but never ever takes any solid action. She talks very loudly on the phone which gives me anxiety.
2. She leaves a bunch of hair on the bathroom floor every time she washes her head. Her response to me calling this out politely was that the cleaning lady would pick it up the next day and that she never throws them away when at her house even.
3. The most irritating is that whenever I am doing something, she asks a lot of questions regarding what I am doing. She has to know what I am studying, what I am working on on my laptop, which friends I was with the whole day, what am I talking about with someone over the call. And if try to ignore her, she peeks and side-eyes whatever I am upto. Her endless inquiries pester me lot. She never fully informs me about her plans and never lets me in her life completely but has to know everything about me.

242,Depression/Anxiety affecting school,116zrhk,"Hey friends! After high school I moved to a new city and mainly worked (service industry), then started realizing/coming to terms with some mental issues that affect me pretty deeply. I was diagnosed with PTSD & Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

I made a good way through therapy and realized I wanted to go back to school and better my future because I wasn’t happy with my current path.

One of the steps I took was minimizing my hours that I work so I could lower my stress and concentrate on class, which led to me stopping therapy a few months ago.

Fast forward I started school and the first month or so went well. However I had a trigger last week throw me back into some unhealthy habits and depression (mainly sleeping way too much, avoiding, and procrastinating)

I blew off a few assignments and made a bad grade or two in my classes.

I know I still have time to atleast try to get it together and recover but now I’m SO stressed out about failing (not just my classes but at like rip)

Im having panic attacks almost daily and ovarian cysts that I’ve had an issue with for awhile ruptured today (I’ve always associated this with stress as well)

243,Should I Ask Out My Speech Presentation Partner?,116yt3a,"Here is my situation:

I'm a male college freshman (19) with no dating experience and have never asked out a girl. I am currently paired up with a girl (also freshman) for our midterm speech assignment in our Business Public Speaking class.

Over the past two weeks, we've met twice outside of class to work on our speech and we both are getting along very well in terms of the work we have made and some small casual talk we've had. I strongly feel that we make a great team for this assignment judging from how easily we make progress on our speech and the conversations we have.

So far we've mostly talked about the assignment itself but we've learned from each other that we are both commuters who only come to school MWF and we both love roller coasters/theme parks. Other small talk has mostly been about our classes and professors. She has paid me a few compliments by saying I am really smart for choosing the topic of our speech (roller coasters) and by slightly teasing me saying I look like an accounting major (I am).

In terms of her personality, she mentioned she was slightly introverted during an ""about me"" assignment on the first day of class. She is friendly, slightly reserved, and smiles a good amount when we speak. I feel that we get along very well due to the fact that I am also an introverted guy who is shy and quiet around people I don't know.

Our speech will be given to the class either at the end of this week or the beginning of next week. As of right now, we are planning to meet in a study room to practice delivering our speech this Wednesday.

If I gather up the courage to ask her out, how should I go about doing it? I am thinking that if I do, I will ask her out after we present our speeches and finish completely with this midterm. I will greatly appreciate any advice on my next step :)",SharkBait1592,32,59,0.93
244,How do you logistically deal with a stomach bug in dorms?,116ynrp,"I am asking because Norovirus and other stomach bugs are going around campus. Ideally, I would just prevent it, but sometimes it’s inevitable. Stomach bugs cause some really nasty symptoms, and if there’s any kind of accident, it is going to be difficult to clean in a dorm.

My dorms have one toilet and one shower for the ENTIRE HALL. Technically, we have 2 of each, but the locks have been removed. They have also taken away every single paper towel machine on campus, so there is no easy access to paper towels.

I know my question is gross, but how do you deal with a stomach bug in this situation? What if you throw up but miss the toilet? What if the bathroom is occupied but you NEED to go? At home, it would be easy to clean up, disinfect, and dispose of soiled towels or wipes. Not here. Sometimes these bugs have people having diarrhea and throwing up at the same time, so a huge mess is guaranteed in that situation. That’s a big mess that there is no way to clean up, not to mention, really embarrassing.

I can’t find anything to answer my question online. I’m sorry, I know this is gross. Is there anything you guys would recommend having around, or advice on how you managed having a bad stomach bug in dorms?

Actually, I was supposed to have graduated in 2022 in my uni's Honors Program; however, due to the honors program being cancelled *the year I was accepted*, it being the first time living away from home, a severe lack of social interaction, and terrible department professors, I've had extreme trouble doing well. Get this: in my five years of uni, *there were only two meteorology courses*. Every sem, they kept getting cancelled due to ""low enrollment"". Right, and what were the 47 Meteorology majors *supposed* to do? Wait? And of course, the Calc 3 and Physics 2/3 profs can't teach for cake, due to a combination of no one speaking good English and zero class interaction, so I've had to self-teach all these hard concepts - except I can't learn via lectures and reading; I need to *do stuff with good feedback explaining how I should improve*.

It's gotten to the point where I'm doubting if I even enjoy a meteorology degree anymore, as the repeated struggles, both academically and situationally, have taxed my self-esteem to the ninth degree. But then, what would the five years and thousands of dollars be for? Nothing! *And in addition*, even though there's plenty of people who have changed majors and etc due to finding a new passion or whatnot, *I have no other passions*. I'm not good at anything, really, other than being mid. Nothing that makes me happy right now (which consists of happy dogs, the BOFURI anime, and creating stats/drawing for my headcanon AU) would make a good alternate career path to follow.

Oh, and the fact that I need to slave my summer away to go suffer for two sems, and the reminder that I can drop out and just work, can go rot in a hole somewhere where the pollutants can be used to make clean energy.

I used to be 36th out of my HS class of over 600 with a 97+ GPA, and yet, now I struggle hard to just barely pass courses. I'm lost, scared, and my patience has run dry. I have zero passions that can sustain me for the rest of my life, and I just want it all to end. I just want to live my life out with the people I love, doing something I like.

I will study abroad next month. I am attending Foundation Year in Science. I am excited and nervous at the same time. Cuz it will be my first time living in a Hostel in a new country with a new language, a new education system, and a new culture.

I have many questions to ask!

1) Where can I do some research for things that I need to follow strictly so that I won't be disrespectful toward local people and others alike?

2) How do you manage your study time and time for other personal affairs? (I definitely don't want to be a nerd studying all the time. I want to get in touch with people. At the same time, I want to do well in my studies and work)

3) Since I am taking Foundation in Science, I will definitely have to study Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics, which are the subjects that I feel are weak. So, how should I prepare for those subjects and how can I be consistently good at them?

4) Another matter is my work. I heard that international students are not allowed to work. The thing is although I am fine with not working, I still want to extend my social circle, and I think the workplace is the best place to make friends with people outside of Taylor's university. What do you suggest?

5) Obviously, this is the most important and tricky thing for me, which is managing my money. How much will it cost per day for food? Is there any other way to save money when it comes to living costs? I am definitely not a good cook, so it is highly likely that I will buy food. But I am not a rich kid either. I want to save as much as possible. I don't want to spend on unnecessary things. So, what do you suggest for that?

I currently have a bachelors in business administration with a concentration in marketing and am working on my MBA which should be done by the end of this year. My job offers me a free bachelors after I’m done but I also have the option of going for a graduate level certificate. I wanted to pursue a second bachelors in communications with a concentration in new media because I believe it would tie in with my previous bachelor as well as my MBA. My goal is to work within the marketing and advertising department and eventually make my way to management. Two certificates im interested in are a graduate certificate in social media marketing and a graduated certificate in leadership of non profit organizations. Although a free ride to a 2nd bachelors sounds amazing I’m starting to doubt if it’s worth it after a previous Reddit post of mine where I asked for opinions regarding which 2nd bachelors to pursue. Some people encouraged me to go for certificates instead to strengthen my resume. My job is also offering me a free ride to as many certificates as I want if I don’t choose the bachelors route. I’d love to hear others opinions and personal experience before I make this big decision. Would you recommend me to go to for a 2nd bachelors in the program mentioned above (which I can complete within a year) or the two certificates mentioned above (which would take about 6 months).

I’m hesitant to go back to college, because the first time around didn’t go well at all for numerous reasons, and I also can’t afford it right now. One of the issues I had in college was that for a good majority of the 4 semesters i was there, I was being taught things I already knew and I got bored very quickly, all while not really knowing what I wanted to do. Right now the two biggest things I want to do is to start a clothing brand and to have a music career. You could say my overarching goal is to be creative and make money while doing so. What I do know is that if I want any of my ideas to be successful, I need to understand business and learn how to run my own business. I know there’s lots of free information out there in books and on YouTube, and I have watched videos and read several books, but honestly the sheer amount of information that there is is kind of overwhelming and I don’t know where to put my focus.

The reasoning as to why I am posting this asking for legal advice on the matter is because I have  screenshot evidence that suggests that I should have been administratively withdrawn by school policy. I believe the school made a mistake in my final transcript because they ignored/overlooked a policy that was in place during the time I took the class in which I should have been withdrawn from the class instead of being given a final grade. I have looked into the FERPA laws and I notice that a student may request a formal hearing into amending the grade and the school may decide to do so.

268,How do you figure out what you need to know for exams?,116pmge,"I'm referring to cases where you have an exam, let's say on four chapters or so, and each chapter in the textbook is so detailed and contains so much information that you can't possibly memorize it all as a full-time college student with extracurriculars. Obviously, my first instinct is to ask the professor what information I need to know for the exam, the depth at which I should be comfortable with the information, and which of the numerous details in the textbook (generally information that must be rote-memorized) must be committed to memory (of course, I would only ask something like ""what should I expect for the exam?"" because I doubt they would give as much information away as they would need to in order to address my previously mentioned concerns). The problem is that this doesn't exactly seem to work for every class. Some professors are very straightforward and provide practice material that makes it clear what they expect you to know for exams while, on the other end of the spectrum, some say ""this is what you need to know,"" go over the ""important"" content in class, but then include material never covered in class or information from half a sentence in one of the 50 pages comprising the chapter, also not mentioned in class.

To better illustrate what I'm trying to ask, I guess an extreme example of a solution for this uncertainty is to memorize every detail you come across in the textbook, but like I said, this is generally infeasible. I'm sure there are some professors who say straight up that you're responsible for everything in the textbook, but that's a different scenario altogether because at least you know you essentially have to study everything to be completely safe.",Thin-Listen,10,5,1.0

I try to keep everything clean, not just my own stuff, but things in the common area and kitchen. I even provided the area with furniture out of my own pocket. I let them share paper towels and dish soap.  

My two other roommates are best friends in high school and college. I am two years older than them. Because of that, I am very much a third wheel. But I feel like if something goes wrong, whether it's a mess or something breaks, all blame is placed on me. 

Lately, one of the roommates is leaving passive-aggressive notes. It's over lint in the dryer. It's something stupid and small. This isn't the first time one of them is doing this passive-aggressive behavior, I suspect who is doing it, but I don't have the guts to confront her. I know that she will hide behind her best friend roommate. And some of this stuff can be chalked up to the he said / she said story.

Besides that, I'm pretty much a ghost. 

I guess it makes sense since it's a community college but it still kinda sucks. No one talks in my classes unless there's group work involved, the halls are usually pretty silent, its mostly just a quick in and out for people, do their classes, do their work, go home. Doesn't help that I'm a pretty giant introvert and always have been.

I've looked into the clubs at my CC but they're extremely limited, not much really peaked my interest. And from what I heard from my only friend here he's in one of those clubs and barely any people show up to the meetings.

I'm pretty lost on what to do. I haven't made a new friend since high school and that's almost an entire year ago now. It's crazy how much of a crutch school is with being social lol. I can already tell my last 2 years probably aren't gonna be much better. I don't live close enough to a big state university to be able to commute there and moving/living there is out of the question so I'll probably end up going to a small and local college. I guess it isn't the worst thing in the world but it kinda sucks when literally no body is interested in starting any conversations with you, let alone becoming friends.

274,is it too late to consider a career change in a dangerously difficult field?,116md53,"I'm gonna be very short:

I'm 20 yrs old, in my 2nd year of my business degree.

I've always wanted to design race cars and do engineering. Long story short, I didn't do it and now I'm studying business.

I don't like what I'm studying right now and tbh idk what I wanna do in the field in the future.

What I know is that I want to design race cars.
Tbh I'm not the smartest kid u've ever seen, but I am willing to put in the work.

I'm thinking of completing this business degree ( I only have about 1.2 yrs/ 3 sems left) and go to usa to for undergrad in mechanical/aeronautical engineering.

275,Mid-college crisis?,116m624,"Hi. I hope I can explain this correctly. I just have this weird feeling and I'm wondering if anyone is experiencing the same. 

I'm a sophomore. It's my second semester (as I'm sure it is for most). I did my first freshman semester at an online community college, then transferred to university. I'm at a weird ""mid-college"" crisis, I guess? It feels like time has just flashed by; I'm already almost a junior. But, at the same time, I'm only almost a junior, if that makes sense. It feels like I don't have much time left in my college career, but also, I know that realistically, I have at least two years (especially since I'm considering grad school) left. I'm literally only 19, and I also know that I have a lot of time after college to experience life before I decide to settle down, but I also feel like I've not taken advantage of the time I've had before. 

It's weird. I'm in a weird spot with my credits, and have been relentlessly pushing myself to fix the situation, so it feels like I haven't really experienced the less-academically-important-but-equally-mentally-important (in my opinion) aspect of socialization as much as I should have. I don't have many friends, but recently, for whatever reason, I've been really trying to get out of my shell and explore new things and make new friends. I don't know what came over me to do this, and I kinda wish I did this sooner. I guess I always thought it would happen naturally. I dunno. In high school, as a sophomore, I couldn't wait to graduate and be done. But now, as a sophomore in college, I feel the same, but I also simultaneously feel the opposite. I don't really want to join a frat or anything, and I've met people from mutual hobbies and clubs (as well as recently meeting up with some people from my university Discord server), but I dunno. I feel like I should've done more, and now that I'm approaching upper division college, I'll need to focus more on career and professional stuff. 

Is this weird? Does anyone feel the same or have had similar experiences?",Frysken,1,7,1.0
276,Had no clue I was supposed to be submitting a certain type of assignment for a class every other week. Don’t no where to go from here.,116lzos,"Edit: My fast typing in the title makes it look like I don’t know the difference between “know” and “no” lmao

Title says it all. I’m panicking and I feel so stupid and embarrassed right now. I am currently taking a 100 level physics class this semester and had no clue I was supposed to be submitting lab reports. I have apparently missed the reports for the first 2 labs of the semester and don’t know where to go about asking the professor to reopen the submission slots.

More background: I was diagnosed with a brain tumor back last April which impacts my cognitive function and induces brain fog. This has greatly impacted my academics. I have accommodations in place, but they specifically state that I must let the professor know that I need an extension BEFORE the assignment is due. The thing is: I genuinely had no clue about these. He most likely mentioned the lab reports in class and I just missed it. I’ve really been having trouble following directions lately and I’m not usually like this. I feel like such an idiot and I don’t know where to go from here.

279,typical small-town girl who wants to leave for college looking for advice,116l4ze,"Hi everyone, i’m a hs senior that really needs some advice, ideally from people who also dreamt of leaving their hometown/state but ended up studying there.

I want to leave my hometown.  Every stupid A i’ve earned, test I’ve cried over, and AP class I’ve taken was fueled purely by me being an amazing student out-of-state schools would love. Tbh that’s not 100% accurate, but I often feel that way. Nobody in their right mind would take AP Research «just for fun». 

That being said, I was just accepted to a first-year study abroad program from my state school. Now, I’m dealing with a lot of internal conflict. On one hand, I could be going to Greece in the fall; I could meet my family just like i’ve always dreamed. On the other hand, when I get back I’ll be back in the same place I’ve always dreamed of leaving.

And in planning to leave, the end goal was simple: run away from the bad memories. That’s not to say wherever I end up will be void of bad moments. However, driving by the same places here that trigger me can’t possibly be doing good things to my brain development. And maybe it’s selfish to run away from triggering situations, but that’s not what I’m here to gauge. Now, my entire belief system is just turned on its head. And I’m terrified.

Please note i’m not dissing the school, If my mental health was healthy I’d probably have no problems going there. But i’m so tired of being in the same area where so many terrible/stupid/life threatening experiences happened. And also, I’m disappointed in myself of breaking such a big promise I made over years. Leaving here truly was my only motivation to keep going against all the odds and stay alive. I could just leave after 4 more years, but for some reason it doesn’t motivate me the same rn.

Is there anyone here who felt like this before? Did you end up studying local? Are you happy/miserable? Do you think you’ll leave after graduation/did you leave? Or is this a problem better suited to talk about with a licensed professional? 😭",SadRectangle,4,2,0.75
280,My roommate locked me out for an hour and a half after I showered,116l347,"Hey everyone!
You may remember me from a post from a few months ago, called “my roommate is about to make me fail my exams.”

I realized i forgot to update that post: basically my RA had a talk with us, which pissed my roommate off even MORE, and she started doing more microaggressions towards me. Now she likes to play her shows out loud all night and screams at me when I try to turn the lights off. I invested in a blackout eye mask and ear plugs, which have greatly helped. I was also told nothing much can be done, as she absolutely refuses to move, and I can’t move my stuff to any of the other dorms available, they’re all across campus and no one I know has a car.

I’ve been spending less and less time in the room and for some reason it’s pissing her off so badly. I was gonna just stick it out for the rest of the year, until today, when she locked me out of the room after a shower. I don’t bring my keys to the shower as she’s usually in there with the door unlocked, and I usually bring undergarments and a robe but no towels, as our room is directly across from the bathroom. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten so mad at someone in my life, nor do I think I’ve ever screamed that much in my life. She flat out told me that she hoped I got assaulted so I wouldn’t spend so much time out of the room.

She stated on the first day of class that this is her second semester ever teaching in person after spending the past several years teaching online classes in Taiwan. 

This whole semester thus far has felt like an entire rip-off for this class. She simply puts the online version of the book on the board during class and basically just reads the headlines of each section. We finish every class about 45 minutes earlier than the allotted time (1.5 hours). On top of all this she doesn't speak English very well and since my university is not a research university whatsoever I struggle to find a solid reason why she should be teaching the class. I have had professors in the past with broken English, but they go above and beyond to communicate things properly to the class and make sure everyone is on the same page.  She doesn't do this at all. She doesn't give us any deadlines or proper notice on when things are due, she schedules all exams to be taken online during the weekends which doesn't seem fair, and when I took my exam yesterday for her class a large portion of the questions were not on the chapter she said the exam would cover and an few were not real questions whatsoever. 

I've tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and realize this is probably a huge struggle for her to adapt to teaching in America, but I cannot help but feel like I am being ripped off and not given a proper learning experience whatsoever.

They all seem to agree that there should be allocated time for studying, but to me it feels like a waste to be doing that when we spend money on flights/transportation and a hotel room to be spending a good chunk of it doing what we normally do at school or at our desks back home. 

This weekend we went away for presidents day and we're only on this trip for two nights and one full day and so I agreed to go only if we didn't study.

I'm a second-year undergrad attending a small liberal arts school in the US. After a completing a summer internship in a niche field, our only professor on campus in the same field took me under his wing and has allowed me to pursue a really exciting independent research project. This project involves a field expedition on the other side of the country, permitting, collaboration with other institutions, grants, etc- and I have done all of this work entirely independently with very minimal assistance or even advising from my professor. At the time, I viewed his lack of aid to be a sign of faith in my abilities. He has always been eccentric, and he considers himself a bit of a maverick in his field- and I interpreted those traits as quirks, not reasons for alarm. However, I've since learned some concerning things about him. 

It turns out that this professor has an abysmal public, professional, and academic reputation. I cannot get into why without risking revealing his identity- but know that he is widely considered to be a crackpot, and he buys into theories that fundamentally undermine the validity of his own research. The lack of support he offers in his lab is not a demonstration of faith, but instead a symptom of how messily he operates. I don't want my professional career to be connected to someone like this. When I brought these concerns up with a department head, I was told that the school were fully aware of his antics (and have been for years) but because he is tenured here was nothing they could do. Myself and the four other students he does research with have all been strongly advised to drop his research immediately, even if it earns us a withdrawn marker on our transcripts. We were told that working with him would very likely be dangerous for our careers and future academic goals.

I intend to stop working with him as soon as possible, but I have invested months into this research project. So much of this research has already been permitted and planned with immense detail.  Because it is essentially entirely my labor, I want to pursue it with a new mentor. However, nobody else at my school works in the same field, and I don't know where else to turn. What should I do?

311,"Is it possible to double major,have a job, and more ?",115ukuh,"Hi :)
I'm currently a high school senior preparing for my freshmen year of college. I am currently planning to go to community college, as it works the best for me financially and in regards to my major. I am planning to move out, but there's going to be a lot in my plate. I need to move out - I have many problems with my family and cannot get anything done in this house because of the traumas and abuse I've experienced here. I'm planning to double major in either Music Preformance and Music Education, or Music Preformance and Political Science. In both these fields, connections and relationships are extremely important, so I was hoping to get a job related to my music field and an internship related to political science. I already have availabilities with the internships, but my main concern is if I will be able to do it all. I don't really have anyone who I can ask and has gone through this experience. Will moving out, double majoring, working, and having an internship be too much to handle? I'm very independent and I'm hoping to get a couple roommates (i don't understand how renting apartments work but I'll do research). I also took the IB Diploma course so I'm hoping that has prepared me in some way for the college work? I'm not sure what to do/if I will be able to handle it and was hoping to get opinions from people who have had the college experience :)

Currently, without the program, I would graduate with $20,000 or more in debt. With it, I would come out debt free. I’m planning on getting my Ph.D., so the money aspect of this is huge for me. It would also allow me to get a head start on grad school.

However, I'm completely helpless from there. I usually just end up copying and pasting huge chunks of text after reading them and trying to commit them to memory. This leaves me with tons of reading to do for exams since I've pretty much just read the book twice. When I do receive a study guide, I usually just study what's listed on it to make my load a little easier. 

I have my first exams next week, and I feel completely overwhelmed because my note-taking behavior is terrible. What I resorted to this last week is simply reading the chapter just once and doing the exercises at the end.

One of my issues is the job prospects for CS are significantly better than in an English-type field. I'm really struggling with what to do. Do I push through CS even though I'd say I'm not that good at programming, not good at math? I'm very early in my CS program but I just feel like I'd hate it.

I would love to become an actor, that’s my dream. All the clout, money, and excitement. I was debating whether or not I should major in drama/theater or anything related to acting, because an acting degree helps but I’m not sure how much. Many actors don’t have an acting degree or do anything related to that. It is really my dream though honestly to become an actor, but it takes a lot of luck to become one too and be successful. And a degree in this field wouldn’t do much I feel like, there is not many careers out there and they don’t even pay as much anyways.

So right now I am currently majored in cybersecurity. I was originally majored in computer science but I narrowed it specifically to cybersecurity to limit the amount of courses I need to take, even if it results in less opportunities. Coding and advanced math are very hard for me to learn and I hate it. With all this being said I’m not even sure if I’ll enjoy working in cybersecurity, because I won’t be doing any career than involves much coding or math either, but even then in general I don’t know if I’ll like what I’ll see, I’m going to try becoming an intern soon to see if I’ll like what I see. I have somewhat of an interest in cybersecurity but I don’t know if I’ll live it and I’m worried if I don’t. I have a feeling I won’t like it but I’m really hoping I do. I just want to find someone I don’t mind doing for a living, and I don’t wanna masts my time and money going to college.

What should I do? What should I pick between these 2 majors? If it were up to me I’d choose the acting major but I’m not sure it’s worth it, and the cybersecurity major, the intern should help me dictate whether or not I wouldn’t mind doing it. Honestly school is making me so depressed and thinking about this freaks me out even more because my whole future is relying on this, on college.",Alarmed_Foundation41,6,2,1.0
353,State school life is disappointing,1150tmi,"I'm extremely salty for not getting into a good school when I was in high school. I tried my extreme best when I was applying, and since I'm not from the US I got into the rat race pretty late, like December of senior year. But I failed to get into any reputable schools, after doing everything in my power during that month. I'm currently a junior at a state school. I see a lot of people going like it doesn't really matter where you go to school, which is correct to a certain extent.

I've been having a great quality of life, it's pretty chill out here and I'm happy. But I can't keep pretending that there is no part of me that wants better. Internally, I'm terribly miserable about the fact that literally everyone who goes to this school is dumb as a rock and has no ambition in life. And I get it, kids wanna party and have fun, But kids who go to reputable schools are involved with their academics, clubs and ALSO party hard.

I feel like even though it's fun and games to have fun with friends and take piss easy classes and live a normal life, there's always the fun of being on the grind, having ambition and wanting to be better in life. I see so many examples of kids who go to Ivies and kill it. They tinker with everything they learn, get involved in clubs and also have amazing internships.

Like I know there's the whole argument about them being rich and privileged but that wouldn't stop me from believing that I would thrive in other good schools. Even though I enjoy life here, I feel like I've become hollow on the inside. I've stopped trying for classes and just do the bare minimum for everything. I love meeting ambitious people and getting involved with a lot of extra-curriculars though, which I couldn't do in high school. But all of this won't change the fact that I've become an absolute moron after being surrounded but sub 100 IQ people (absolutely no offense to them, it's just annoying sometimes that people complain about freshmen level classes and have no goals or seriousness).

I definitely won't get into a good (like actually good, I don't wanna pretend that schools that admit 40% of applicants are reputable) grad school, because I focused on living a peaceful life, travelled and did what was fun for me. I have no actual skills and my GPA is average. And I don't even know whether that would fill the void even if I got in, and I don't even know what field to pursue. I made a lot of friends but it pains me to know that they're just as dumb and broke as me (I love them, but they don't inspire me to go ahead in life). I sound insufferable when saying this, but for the love of god I feel like I'm trapped with NPCs. Like the physical embodiment of NPCs. My brain literally internally bleeds when talking to some people.

I'm not trying to act better than anyone, and I really do love my friends and the students here. You could say that me saying people are stupid is me finding my own reflection in them and getting annoyed, and you wouldn't be entirely wrong. But at this stage, I have absolutely no clue what to do about this. I know a lot of people here but I'm extremely bored and have no excitement in interacting with them. I tried my hardest to be social my freshmen and sophomore years, and made a lot of friends I still spend time with, but I feel like I no longer give a shit. I want to meet people who have that glow in their eyes. idk like, the hope to learn and master whatever they're doing, lead the nation, solve cancer or idk make a billion dollars or whatever. They don't have to do that, but I just want to see people's eyes open up when I mention something they've been doing or plan to do. I love the feeling when a conversation makes you realize how minute our existence is, or something about a crazy bucket list item that someone wants to do like jump off a cliff or some shit. No more of those fun facts in every class where starbucks venti iced latte drinking NPCs say that they can drive a stick shift or they just got back from Puerto Rico.

I apologize for my harsh language. I just wanna meet cool people who can drive me to be cooler. I'm also sorry for posting this now, when most people",throwa_way3,4,0,0.3

385,HELP ME DECIDE! Studying Abroad vs. Interning as a senior who has never done either,114c5mp,"Hi everyone! Warning, this is probably going to be a long thread.

So l’m conflicted because I have two opportunities this summer to choose from. I am currently a senior about to graduate and I need one more summer class to
complete my degree.

My first option is a study abroad program happening in Rome for about a month that will cover the last credit that I need for my degree. I put in a lot of effort for the program application and also to get a grant to help fund the program. I got the grant but I still have to pay around $3000 to go unfortunately. But I feel like it might be a once in a lifetime opportunity.

But on the other hand I applied for internships this summer for the Student Conservation Association. It's something that I've also
always wanted to do as well, and I will get paid for it but I know it won't be as fun. But it could lead to future job opportunities.

It's for a site located on a mountain that's pretty remote and I would be leading tours of the site and also just maintenance of the facilities. This is for three months and it's pretty far away from my home state as well. But my references gave me really great recommendations and I wouldn't want to let them down.

I looked to see if I could potentially apply for other internship opportunities in the future if I were to go to Rome but it looks like this is one of the biggest
opportunities for me because most of the internships
that they offer are in the summer. 

And it's not as common to have these opportunities during the year. So I feel like both of these would be once in a lifetime
opportunities, one that I have to pay for and one that I get paid doing. I just don't know which one to choose. I know the internship would probably be the smarter choice but what do you guys think? is there any advice to offer here?

They have literally copied available code online and used that as their submission.  When asked to explain how the code works - to show that they at least understand what they're submitting, they offer up nothing of substance. Often times these students don't attend lectures and, generally speaking, are lost.  

I work with three wonderful TAs and we make a very concentrated effort to provide helpful resources, relevant lectures, multiple office hours, and step-by-step lab guides.  Basically, if you show up and pay even the minimum level of attention, you'll pass.   And, I'll be honest, the time and emotional effort spent policing and dealing with bald-faced lying is having me reconsider the career I've long loved and enjoyed.  I just can't.  It's not worth it.  

Anyway, my questions are two-fold:  


1. How would you, as a student, like faculty to address students who cheat?  What is a proper action in your eyes?  What would be fair to you (grade drop? expulsion?)?
2. If you have cheated, why have you cheated?  Was it desperation under a deadline or inability to get the help you need or?

I'm asking to better understand where my own students are coming from and, as of right now, am hesitant to have this conversation with them for fear of having those students who are legitimately doing the work feel I'm suspicious of them.  I'd rather not cultivate that dynamic...so, reddit it is :)",anoddlittlebird,65,103,0.93
387,Thoughts on dropping Electives?,114b29u,"So I'm a Junior going into Electrical Engineering and I'm starting to do electives. Doing moderately well (3.41 GPA), but things are getting interesting. 

I signed up for a Photonics course and after 6 weeks I've lost all interest in the field and don't enjoy the class, but I respect those that are pursuing it. I could push through and *maybe* get a decent grade (B or above), but I don't know if there's a line between being disciplined and pushing through or cutting losses (GPA wise) and finding other EE fields/electives that do interest me.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is if it's better to deal with it and push through or drop it and find other classes that I like. I like EE and don't regret majoring in it, but Photonics just isn't for me, the question is just how I should move forward.

394,"I need advice on dropping out, please help",1148f22,"So my dad just got approved for ssdi, I (18 F) qualify for $900 a month if I'm at least part time enrolled in school. Well, it took my dad a long time to get approved so I thought that once he got approved I could apply to a college and then start getting money pretty quick. Apparently thats not how it works, my dad has to get processed too. Now because no one told me that, (only how he had been accepted after waiting like a year or two already) and I was being pressured to start college for other reasons, I started looking at potential colleges. My grandmother found a pretty nice one and texted me one day to come over to her house and we would look at the school and see how we like it. Well when I got there she already had all the information typed out on the application form for a degree I never wanted in the first place. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have even gone to school in the first place. But it wasn't, I knew how much it meant to my other grandmother (I will be referring to her as Nana). I had already decided that with the ""free money"" (I say that very lightly lol) and my Nanas eagerness for me to start school, that I would do it, I just wanted to wait a little bit. Well, I thought I had mentioned my unwillingness enough times to stick. I already have a few job offers I could take for the summer this year if I really wanted to. Anyway, I asked my grandmother if I had to do this. She told me I had too. So obviously I thought her and Nana had talked it out and they determined I had to start right away, which was the only reason why I caved in. So I accepted and she called Nana and they paid. When I got home that night, my Nana and Dada (primary caregivers/parental figures) asked me if this is what I wanted. I told them this: ""No, but it's something I have to do"" referring back to what my grandmother had said previously. Well, here I am a few days later and I just now got off the phone with my Nana who told me she had no idea and that she was never gonna force me to go to college, as well as it would take until the end of the year most likely before I would receive the ssdi benefits and none of which would include money I would have made if I was getting paid as soon as I started school. So now I'm at a crossroads, I never wanted to start school in the first place because I was scared I would give up halfway through or change my mind and switch majors. I wanted to wait and plan everything out and not jump right in. I jumped right into work right after high school and worked myself sick, I didn't wanna repeat that. Tomorrow i think, is the deadline to ask for our money back. I don't wanna be labeled a college dropout. The mere thought of it makes me want to cry tbh. I know that this is mostly my fault for not checking in with both parties. Most of the time they do consult each other about my school so I just assumed they both knew everything. Now I have no idea what to do, I have less than 24 hours to figure out if I drop out and get the money back, or switch majors which will still leave me with the same issue because I have no idea what I want to do.

My journey with college has been a struggle for the last 20 years, but I finally managed to graduate summa cum laude this year.

I was hoping to get free tickets through my pilot brother, but standby doesn't seem feasible coming from NC. Additionally, the costs of airline, hotel, rental car/Uber, and recent medical expenses, such as an MRI and a new set of tires, have left me slightly in debt.

Despite the obstacles, I reached out to some of my family members, hoping they would come together and help me attend for my emotional well-being. Unfortunately, they dismissed my request, saying it would be boring and a waste of money, even though it means a lot to me.

My girlfriend wishes she could help me more, but she encourages me to stay positive and be excited about my achievements despite the challenges I'm facing.

My teacher is very good at math, but he is not so good at explaining and breaking math down for people who are not very good at math. For reference I'm horrible at math. If it Trig/Precalc wasn't required as a prerequisite for the chemistry course that I need for my degree, I wouldn't even take it. 

I still have time to withdraw from the trigonometry class and enroll in a session 2 (half a semester, condensed) online pre-calculus class. I have already been receiving tutoring for the trigonometry class and I've spoken with my tutor and also with an advisor from the chemistry department. Both of them recommend pre-calculus to me as it basically has an algebra refresher for the first half of the course. The only problem is that the course being a session 2 course means that it is condensed. I'm trying to decide if I should just try to stick it out with trigonometry which is an in-person class, or if I would do better taking pre-calculus online? I will only have one proctored exam and I tend to get very bad test anxiety, especially in person. Can anyone advise me on whether or not they think I would do better in pre-calculus, especially having already been exposed to some of the trigonometry concepts that I know will be covered in the later half of the precalculus class? 

I also want to add that my current trigonometry teacher is not someone who I feel confident that I can go to in private for help. I also do not feel comfortable asking questions or for him to explain something in class. He frequently makes jokes about the other students while they are in the room and he likes to single people out and make people go up to the board and write equations. I have major anxiety in his class and I've almost had a panic attack a couple of times because of his demeanor in class and also his dismissiveness when I reached out to him at the beginning of a semester asking for help with a homework problem. I was basically told to ""think positively"" and ""work harder"" and he did not help me solve the equation at all, even after I let him know that I spent three hours trying to figure it out.

428,Does anyone else lie about how well they do on difficult exams or hard assignments?,113uyl8,"I'm in college and I study very hard and have done well on all of my exams. I think that the lowest grade I have gotten on an exam in college was a B- and all of my overall grades for classes have been an A or an A-. I often find myself feeling guilty about doing well when I hear my friends talk about how poor they did on their exams. Sometimes, I lie about my grade and tell them I got a B (when I actually got an A). 

No one has ever given me a hard time for having good grades but I find that when you do really well on a test when everyone else bombs it, people look at you differently (like you're not one of them). I also just feel like it opens the door for resentment or jealousy.

429,Struggle between choosing or dropping CS Major,113tmiq,"Current freshman - Right now I am still struggling to decide if I should drop my CS major or not. FYI, I did not get into college as a CS major and actually transferred into it thinking it would be a useful major. Indeed, that's what I hear from peers, parents, industry professionals, and people online. I learned that having a CS major is helpful not only for SWE/CS positions but also outside of the industry in other fields like business and virtually any role that needs computer proficiency.

However, personally, I am not really that interested in CS. You could say that I am taking it rather just because it would be beneficial upon graduating. I know this is definitely not the right approach, but I could hardly talk myself out of it considering the thousands of dollars I am paying my college every year for a degree.

Actually, I've already talked my parents out of it. They are very supportive and say I should do whatever I want with changing my majors. I actually want to change my current combination of CS/Econ to something like International Relations/Econ. But I also worry about the potential job outcomes of these majors. I may enjoy learning these more at school, but upon graduation, I would be having a very hard time looking for careers because of my lack of CS skills.

I would like to hear advice from people on this sub. Do you think I should bite my teeth and keep pushing? Or should I switch to a major that is more interesting but opens fewer doors upon graduation? My desired industries are anything business/finance/consulting/policy related. I could not see myself working as a full time SWE or engineer any time soon

&#x200B;

Side note: I started wondering if I should drop CS not just this semester, but at the beginning of the school year. I did pass the Java class with an A and am currently taking discrete math for CS (which I truly don't like because of how theoretical it is)",MahoushiMegumin,4,2,1.0
430,Between Two Colleges,113suan,"Hey y’all, so I’ve arrived at the sad point of the year where I have to weed out my college options based on what my family can afford. I was considering 4 colleges and now I’m down to 2, UNT (University of North Texas) and Texas A&M. Before I get into each, I know that A&M is much better for engineering, it’s my dream school. 

UNT is basically covering a semester each year, and I don’t have to pay housing since I live not even 10 minutes away from campus, plus 2 of my friends are going there, one will also be studying engineering. But I’m worried about engineering at UNT since it’s obviously far from what the university is known for, as well as it being a comparatively heavy liberal arts college, which isn’t what I’m looking for.

At A&M I don’t even know what I’ll be paying yet, but I have to either start with Engineering at Galveston, or go through the Engineering Academy at Tarrant County College. Each have their pros and cons. If I go to Galveston I’ll be paying for housing, and it’s really far away. If I do the Engineering Academy it’s basically an hours commute everyday and I’m at the mercy of traffic, and I’d pay even less than UNT, but then go to College Station after a year to continue my degree, so the cost will increase a lot. 

A&M is the goal, but right now I have little to no what of achieving it, financially speaking. My parents don’t want to be taking on a large amount of debt, nor give me a large amount of debt. I’m just at a loss honestly, I worked hard to get into A&M and now it might not even be feasible.

So that’s where I’m at. I know what I want personally but I want advice from people in college or graduated because they probably have more knowledge and wisdom than me on this topic. Any advice is greatly appreciated. This is all just so stressful.",Haydawg14,0,3,1.0

I've already got offers from top universities in other countries (eg Imperial College London) and have applied for scholarships to other universities such as UBC in Canada. I would only even consider the US if I get a good financial aid package from a well known uni.

Is the US college system worth it? In the UK I would get a Masters in 4 years, but I won't get any aid so will have to pay about $20k a year in tuition alone. On top of that, my parents are scared by all the news recently, and are pushing me to turn down any offers I get from the US, even Ivies.


edit: I'm applying for biotech or engineering programs, so bioengineering at ICL and the faculty of applied science at UBC. in the US I've applied to mostly Ivies, and some with specific engineering colleges like Columbia Engineering.

It sounds like a great idea. So I went to a college that did that. And it wasn't what I had expected.

They can say anything they want. There's very little oversight and you have little to no recourse if you disagree with something.

They can lie about you. They can make anyone look as bad as they want or as good as they want. It's completely subjective.

And there's no way to predict what they'll say. You can get good comments on your papers and then get randomly attacked in your final evaluation for the class, the one that's part of your transcript.

One professor can have a huge impact on your future options for anything that requires a transcript just by lying about about you in an evaluation. You can wind up feeling completely slandered, thrown out like trash, and robbed of future options in life.

As great as the idea seems, I would exercise caution with colleges like that. Make sure they offer some kind of recourse when someone feels misrepresented, a way to dispute the evaluations.

My mom and older sister died when I was 16, my brother isn’t in my life really and my dad has been a deadbeat ever since losing my mom 11 years ago, so much so to the point that my fiancée and I are having him turn over parental rights for my troubled 16 year-old sister so we can help her get back on track. My fiancée has a masters and a stable, well paying job and up until a few weeks ago I had a job in corporate recruiting that paid extremely well. I lost my job due to a restructure in the company and I’m having a hard time finding any work now because everyone wants an applicant with a degree. I’m kind of at a loss of what to do, and have thought about going back to school to get my degree.

I have a 2 year diploma which covered IT and programming topics including database, algorithms, web design, programming courses for various languages, and even a work project for a company developing a piece of software, up to (the college's) 300 level courses. Specifically I went to Camosun College. I tried to apply last year as a transfer student to SFU and was rejected for not having 24 credits. It seems like ICS (the term for IT and comp sci. type courses at Camosun) are not even recognized on the BC transfer credit database and are, in the eyes of proper universities, completely worthless. I am trying to come to grips with the fact that despite all the time and money I spent on my diploma that I'll have to go back for another 4 years to get any proper software/comp sci. degree.  


Has anyone experienced a similar issue and knows if there is anything I can pursue? I am willing to move if the universities that I can get into aren't in the lower mainland but it seems like I just made a major mistake with my diploma by not taking one that is specifically designed for transferring.

I could be 100% wrong so please don't take that as me saying other fields aren't difficult or complex please ;~;

I'm a first semester Chem major and currently in my first Gen Chem class. There have been quite a few things so far that the professor has briefly touched on but then said it was irrelevant to this class and not to worry about it. I assume that those comments maybe are mostly because this is a required course for many stem degrees, but most won't go past this one in chemistry so it may not be worth the time to further explain something??

Anyway, my point is, do you think students can ask questions that are too combursome to entertain for their current knowledge level? If not, do you like students engaging conversations with you like that, especially if they're studying your field? 

I come up with a few questions almost every lecture about certain things that he hasn't mentioned. Mostly ideas that I come up with on how things may interact, why something is the way it is, etc. I haven't bothered him with any of these cause I 1) don't know if it's actually just a dumb question and 2) I don't know if it would just be an annoying question to try and explain at my current level.

Obviously I know this varies by professor, but just curious for general opinions.

And for any Chem profs an example of my questions would be, yesterday we went over acids, bases and at the end he began to briefly touch on hydrates. He was explaining naming them and going over the prefixes when it comes to expressing the number of water molecules. He mentioned that some are said to have 1/2 a molecule and our prefix chart didn't show that so he told us that had the prefix of hemi. He used copper(II) sulfate hemihydrate as the main example. He explained that it basically means there is 1 water molecule that is somehow associated with 2 copper(II) sulfates. My questions are basically shouldn't that mean we have (CuSO4)2 ° 1H2O? And if not, just in general how does that even work? And does this mean that hydrates can only ever be considered to have one of the compound, and however many water molecules attached to it?",Ox-Moi,31,18,0.8

* more relaxing senior year (I'll have space to drop a class)
* probably easy if I put in the effort (morale is low for me rn lol)

Cons:

* low interest
* wasting 7 hours a week

513,Did this Professor violate title 9?,112mrnw,"
I have a math professor who goes off topic frequently with his own opinions. One day recently he said and I quote “lgbtq people are wackos and anyone that supports them are too”. I’m not even summarizing or exaggerating, these are direct quotes he has said. I felt the lgbtq quote was extremely inappropriate so I contacted the title 9 coordinator as I felt his comments were inappropriate and could negatively affect a student who identifies as lgbtq. At the meeting I told her everything that happened and she agreed it was inappropriate and unprofessional. Except at the end she said she didn’t find the comments to be discriminatory so therefore this wouldn’t fall under a title 9 violation. This confused me a lot because I don’t see how those comments could be seen as non-discriminatory to lgbtq students. I am wondering if I’m missing something or if the college is just trying to avoid a title nine investigation. Any advice?

Update to this: This happened halfway thru the fall semester. I ended up dropping the class because I found the professor to be awful at teaching math and distracting with his political rants. They opened a non-title nine investigation on him and it seems other students supported my claims. He was an adjunct professor so the school ceased hiring him for future semesters.",Chief_redbull,48,65,0.89

- **Blue Pill:** Bachelors + Masters in Computer Science
  - Time: 3.5 Years Total For Both

  - Note: The plan is very tight, where if one class moves to another semester or time conflicts arise, I might be completely off track and only get the bachelor's degree.

- **Red Pill:** Major in Comp. Sci + Minor in either [Entrepreneurship, Data Engineering, or Finance]

  - Probability: ~100% Unless unforeseen accidents happen.

Option 2: go for a 2yr degree you take a slightly different exam and different license. And if someone is willing hire you, if you work there for 2 years and your job fills out the paperwork , then you can apply for the full license that’s the same as the 4yr degree 

So I sounds like both options are gonna take 4 years. I like that option 1 is straightforward and as long as you pass the exam and apply your license is guaranteed. Is a Bachelor’s degree more appealing on a resume than a Associates?

These questions must include the graphs and figures that we have to code and calculate outside of the lab/class time. The code we have to show and label appropriately. 

This is all too much in not enough time. To top it off, the TA is completely unaware of the lab assignment and unable to really guide us on it as she doesn't have access to it or make it. The TA, however, does grade the assignments after the due date, which is bizarre. I visit the TAs office hours every week, and she mentioned that the lab assignments seem like an outrageous amount of work. 

Both my peers, TA, and I agree. However, I'm not sure how to bring this up to the professor. There is also the factor of her being brand new, so there is the possibility that she doesn't understand what workload is reasonable.

I had a quiz that I bombed yesterday because I had no time to study for it due to me taking so long to complete the labs. A quiz on Monday that I didn’t do because I didn’t have enough time to study for it. 

I didn’t even bother attending any of my classes today because I knew I would fail for not having enough knowledge thanks to me taking a long ass time completing a lab/assignment. I’m behind on three labs from three classes each.

554,Question about college choice (help idk what to do lol),111u2jn,"Hey! Ill make this brief.

I want to pursue Civil Engineering with a concentration in Environmental Engineering and I'm left with two choices (i got accepted at both):

1. Going to a prestigious school, top 100 worldwide, which is something I really dont want to as I hear really bad things about the quality of life as an engineering student there.

2. Going to my dream college, not very known worldwide as it's a new university but the curriculum is excellent, offers coop and internships, much cheaper and a more interactive campus.

Pros and Cons of each:

PROS FOR COLLEGE N.1: 

• The ""school name""
• Better possibility to work in the us? I guess?

CONS FOR COLLEGE N.1:

• No time for part-time job
• Harder to make friends as I am a highly social anxious person around competitive atmospheres (not that im dumb or anything I just hate when people's whole life revolves around academic success)
• No coop 
• Harder to pursue Graduate studies due to the difficulty of maintaining a harder GPA


PROS FOR COLLEGE N.2 :

• I have my friends I've had since middle school going there.
• Much nicer campus life, friendlier people, close to my part-time job.
• Offers a coop program and paid internships
• Possibility for me to pursue a MASC or PHD  due to the actually reasonable amount of work (College N.1 student's average around the 45% on exams which rly worried me)
• Excellent engineering school (top 10 in Canada with the College n.1 being number 9)

CONS FOR COLLEGE N.2:

• Not as well known as College n.1
• Not as easy to work in the US ig?


Basically I just want to know how much does the ""SCHOOL NAME"" really matter cause I really am not willing to sacrifice 4 years of my happiness to a diploma that would get me the same job opportunities as the second college.

567,Learning how to cook early is really important,111olkq," 

Many of us going to college have limited, if any, knowledge of the culinary arts.  Basic needs are of even great importance. Food is one such basic need, and to go to college, or be independent, as the two go hand in hand, one must have knowledge of its preparation. To go into college not knowing how to cook is to subject oneself to the consumption of instant ramen for what may seem like an eternity. I’m posting to speak about the benefits of learning to cook at a younger age. It’s essential because it allows one to live a healthy and independent lifestyle. 

My brother went off to college a few years ago, and to see the weight he gained going into college was astonishing, but the weight he lost over a summer of learning just the basics of cooking for oneself even more so. Because of this I thought it necessary to bring about awareness of home-cooking's benefits, as well as discover them for myself. My brother was one of many students going into college, all too often finding themselves without the knowledge needed to prepare a proper meal, leading to the consumption of unhealthy meals in favor of their ease. A study was done by the University of Vermont to test what would happen if college students were taught how to cook via weekly classes. The results were, as expected, phenomenal, but only for so long. After a while, enthusiasm dwindled, and the college students reverted to their stereotypical diet of ramen and such. Imagine for a moment, if these students were taught to cook a few years before, or while they were growing up. The classes’ information would have been retained much longer if the students had been exposed to the content earlier, but most importantly, they would have likely been completely unnecessary if the students had already known how to cook. 

Another example of many showing just how important it is to learn to cook was written by the respected Lindsey Taillie, a journalist reporting on the benefits of proficiency in the culinary arts, especially moving into college, based on a recent study. Her report states these benefits as relating to an increased, “intake of fruits and vegetables \[to\] prevent obesity \[and result in\] overall healthier dietary patterns.” Every one of these is essential to a healthy lifestyle. From this one can logically infer that learning to cook before a typical college menu takes its toll is absolutely vital to a nutritious diet. It is quite sad that studies like this must be done in the first place, so I do encourage everyone here to never let themself be considered as a subject to them.  

Moving on from that, the esteemed College Student Journal, an establishment covering many aspects of college students’ lives in their entries, has something to say on this very topic. In one such entry, they stated based upon a study of theirs that many college students had, “reported a lack of confidence in how to plan, shop and cook healthy meals. Further, participants were unsure how to budget and plan out what to spend their money on related to food.” Not only does this highlight how important learning to cook is to stay healthy, but also how important it is for independence. If one is unsure how to prepare a quality meal on their own without any guidance, how can they expect to live on their own, a much more challenging prospect, without any guidance? Both independence and good health are unachievable without knowledge of culinary arts. 

It is apparent that many college students are not knowledgeable of even the most basic foundations of cooking. The fundamentals are lost, and so it is more than worth mentioning how one absorbs the information at first. Depending on learning styles, time needs to be spent on either watching media that teaches one how to cook, experimenting from scratch, or building on already made recipes. It is all too important to learn this skill because, all too fast, healthy options are usurped by too convenient junk foods. Following this, if one were to buy food at a grocery store that is convenient *and* healthy, it can become expensive extremely fast. This also leads to dependence down the road, which is why learning to cook is also essential to the notions of independence and freedom. 

Along these lines, it is also most vital to account for what must be done for the former to work. For one to really learn to cook, it is essential to treat the skill as one might learning to drive, practicing often and with the intent to learn. In the cooking classes mentioned earlier, students stopped cooking a bit after the classes ended. Consistent practice would help retention of the skills. Some may say college students live off the bare minimum of required nutrients because of their budget, but a bag of lentils at the store with some broth is not a whole lot more than a package of bologna, and the bologna’s nutritional value is far surpassed for the extra few cents, or dollar.  

Most have heard that ten thousand hours at practice are enough for one to master a skill. However, only hours spent with the purpose of improvement count toward the ten thousand. If one spends ten thousand hours cooking toast, they will not magically be able to cook a perfect filet mignon. No, one must challenge themselves gradually with dishes of increasing difficulty if they wish to master the culinary arts.  

It is important to remember that practice – consistent, purposeful practice – makes perfect for most things. Too many entering universities do so without knowing how to cook, and so resort to unhealthy meals, or depend on others for food. To not be one of them, learning how to cook is necessary, but requires practice. Weight gain in college can be avoided, and in that avoidance is an art, as well as independence. With all of this in mind, volunteering to make dinner for a night or two would be beneficial, and if that is already done, one could benefit from making something a bit more complex.",TurbulentWelder2833,0,2,1.0

Now, most people get excited and think ""wow you're so lucky"", don't get me wrong it's cool knowing multiple languages and different cultures but I had to struggle in school for not understanding what was going on 90% of the time because every 3 years I had to restart my lifestyle, my learning/studying method, in each school I went to the level of the subjects they were learning were always different, I don't have a solid base on education. 

I ""finished"" high school 7 months ago, I added quotation marks because I did complete my 13 years of school but I never got my diploma because a teacher didn't like me so he kept on taking points off of my scores and gave me way too difficult tasks for extra points knowing I couldn't do it because I don't fully understand his native language but he would give free points to my classmates so they can receive the diploma but he didn't even acknowledge my effort and took points away instead (this teacher's judgment was important since he held teachers meetings and discussed everyone's grades, he can give more to those that deserved it for the effort they put in or take from people who had either inconsistent attendance or they were lazy and didn't deserve it, I suppose).

For further context, I am a straight-A student and work my  tail off; I am not incapable of getting less than an ""A"". I have just worked hard in these tough classes.

I have to take a few undergrad pre-recs. The class is in Linux (System Programming to be specific). It is online, but the professor actually does good work: he posts weekly lectures in real time, is very responsive to e-mail, and seems to actually care. I thought this class was going to be great.

We took our first quiz and I got a 60%. I figured he was just trying to scare us, because he said everyone would receive a 100% for just doing it afterwards. I took the second quiz yesterday and got a 60% again. I talked to other students and they are all doing poorly as well. 

Here is my issue: the quiz questions are WAY too specific. We will get 100 pages of reading + notes, and he will ask the SMALLEST detail about a singular Linux command - like literally he will give us a command of 20 characters and ask us about one character. And these are not giant, well-known commands that we use all the time. These are tiny commands that he mentioned for 7 seconds in an hour-long video. It is ridiculous.

Tonight I have office hours. 

What I *want* to say is, ""Dude. This is a 2xx-level class. You cannot be THAT specific. I am okay with a class being *hard* but this is basically impossible, unless I just memorize a hundred pages of commands a week.""

What do I do? What am I doing wrong? How do I know which commands are imperative to actually memorize? I am noticing that what I believe are the important commands are not being tested.""

I don't think I can keep going like this. my last semester I got all A's, so to outsiders it seems like I'm doing fine, but man, I'm an art student. Grades barely matter, and those A's are more indicative of how generous and understanding my professors were; in reality I barely attended class, finished less than half of my projects the whole semester, and dropped classes to go part-time, hoping it would help, but it wasn't enough. 

My parents and my therapist have basically told me different versions of ""just power through it"", but I can't. Especially because all of my assignments are art. It's not a set start or finish, a list of questions to answer, or busywork. It's always personal and being creative is really hard for me right now, almost impossible. My parents are also scared that if I take a leave of absence and get a job or something, I'll be stuck doing that forever and never go back to school. The only person that has suggested that a leave might be a good idea was my advisor. 

But I know a lot of people deal with depression in college, and they still carry on. Am I just being lazy, or giving up too easily? Just making an excuse to do nothing? I want to spend the time off seeking more active mental help, but is that enough reason? I don't know anymore.",misterlemonguy,21,42,0.92
588,What are 2 courses that everyone should take to advance their careers?,111c00r,"I have space for 2 electives in the next year before I graduate with my BA.

I have completed a bit over 60 college credits through dual enrollment, and if I transfer these to the college I’m looking at, almost all of my general ed and some major requirements/electives will be complete, leaving me with an open space (after general ed reqs) for either 2 majors or a major and 2 minors.

Perhaps a little more so for psychology, but I would argue most people would lean that way. After all, psychology is the most popular major for a reason. It's just something us humans naturally are drawn to based on our evolution, I think   


However, I think computer science would perhaps be the wiser career choice. Better salary, benefits, more job opporunities, future growth, etc. With a bachelor's (or even no degree) in tech you can make bank, 120-200k or more. In psychology, even with a masters or doctorate, you'd be lucky if you break 100k, it seems. 

My biggest complaint with choosing CS over Psych is probably that I really enjoy working with and helping people. The material is far more interesting, as well. Coding and computers are interesting too, but if I could pick one it would be psychology. With that being said, I don't think I would ever be happy with my salary in psych. A quick Google search reveals many people in the field complain about the money, even those who love their job.

619,Need some perspective on being a student leader?,110rd99,"**Background**: Hi all, I am a college student pursing a major in C.S. and I am currently the owner of a discord server for a college class, and need some perspective/advice on my current situation.

**Context**: I decided to make a discord server for one of my college classes so I can better improve on my teamwork abilities and leadership skills as a person, which I find I stuggle with (specifically teamwork). By nature I would say I am more introverted than extroverted, I like to complete all my assignments on my own, workout by myself, and usually learn/teach myself most subjects academically or otherwise on my own. 

With that being said, through working part-time for quite sometime and working in a leadership capacity at my workplace, I have learned how detrimental it is to *not* have teamwork or leadership qualities. Thusly, I have taken it upon myself to force myself to be a better team leader and team player by taking on the responsibilty of being an owner for a discord server for one of my college classes. While the responsibilty isn't overly taxing, it does take a bit of time out of my week to complete college coursework for other courses, and otherwise time to spend on clubs and my other interests. I act in a middleman capacity, relaying information not divulged by the course professor in a timely manner, and helping fellow classmates navigate through any confusion they may have with the course/course material. 

**Issue:** I find myself asking if I am really improving my teamwork skills and leadership abilities by being the owner of a discord server for a college class. This is my second time being the owner of an academic discord server for a college class (I did this for a course last semester as well), and yet I cannot decisively say that I have gained much of anything by acting in a leadership capacity. I feel as though it is just a time consuming activity that only benefits those who reach out for help (which I don't mind doing, I like to help people). However, I don't think acting in this leadership capacity, is improving my teamwork or leadership abilities. 

I acknowledge I lack the experience to make sound conclusions in this context, but I am starting to realize working in a leadership capacity in academia and the workplace is similar in some ascpects but are fundamentally two different things. In the workplace, I gain experience (though sometimes tiring and exhausting) by working with my coworkers in a leadership capacity. I learn how to modulate & leverage my experience in the capacity I work in, to guide and help others. However, in academia, I'll reiterate, I feel as though it is just a time consuming activity that doesn't increase my ability to work in a team setting or help me work on myself as a leader.

Given what I have outlined above, what would you advice be to me? Do you think I should stop pushing myself to improve on my teamwork and leadership skills (at least in the context of academia)? If you are/were in a similar position to mine did you have expreiences in academia, the workplace, or in life that helped you better increase your teamwork and/or leadership skills? If so, could you talk about them?

I'm currently in a music history class as a gen ed, and the professor requires that we attend two professional level concerts during the semester. Then, write essays on them using the knowledge we've learned in class.

Fine, the assignment makes sense, except for the fact that we are expected to buy these tickets, pay for the transportation to get there, etc. Now I don't know about everyone else, but I'm not exactly rolling in money to drop on concerts that I don't even want to attend just so I can do an essay and pass a GEN ED class. Multiple of my classmates in group chats have also complained about the financial burden this is. The cheapest concert I found is around $40 for an amateur artist, but any ""good"" ones are at least $150-200, not including money for the train, etc. How is that okay??

It's past the Add/Drop period now, otherwise I would've changed courses. Is there anything that really can be done about this? How do I talk to the professor about this? I feel like it's completely unfair to students already paying thousands of dollars in tuition to tell them they'll fail if they don't cough up some more cash to do their essays.

We had a previous assignment that we would use as a guide to this written assignment, now in the previous assignment, we were supposed to write in French but I wrote it in English by accident. When we did the in-class assignment, it was the same prompt and since we were allowed to use our previous assignment as an outline I just translated it BY MEMORY, not with any translator. 

I did use a translator (reverso context) to translate some words (note that we were allowed to do this) but that's about it, I even asked my professor for more time to do the assignment as well as asked for a couple of words I wasn't sure about so at some point, she did see my screen and could see the translator open with only words in it.

I have had this professor last semester and I was at the top of her class, mostly because my mother language is Spanish, so I can read and listen to French for the most part, most of the sentences written in my assignment were basic sentences, I only looked up for some words, and I even spotted 2 mistakes I made where she says I cheated.

672,"Can't complete FAFSA due to absentee parents, considering somewhat drastic alternatives to complete it",10zna39,"\*Burner account for reasons that will become more obvious\*

I grew up in an abusive household and ran away before completing high school, dropping out and obtaining my GED and going straight to work. With no family support my life was difficult; I often slept on the subway and couchsurfed and worked my ass off to get back on my feet, eventually finding stability by working a minimum wage job at day and being an escort and doing amateur porn (I'm serious). It's been a few years and I decided to reattempt going to college. I got accepted to college for the fall semester of this year! I feel stable enough to go to college and move forward with my life, but I have a major problem which is that I cannot complete my FAFSA because I'm no-contact with my family and I'm considered a dependent due to me not being 24 yet. In my case, FAFSA allows exceptions if any of the following are true:

\- I'm married

\-I've been homeless or at risk of homelessness within the past year

\-I'm working towards a post-grad degree

\-I'm a veteran or currently in the military

\-I have my own dependents

\-I am an orphan or been in foster care

\-I was an emancipated minor

I was going to go with the homelessness route. In that case, I would need the approval of the financial aid office at my school, which requires proof. I met with financial aid and they told me they could only approve it if I had evidence from an institution that helps homeless people. Unfortunately, I've never been in a shelter (shelters in my city are incredibly dangerous, moreso than sleeping on the subway) nor have I been to food banks (I still paid for my food w my job income and occasionally dumpster dived in supermarket dumpsters). They basically told me I'm SOL and would need to pay for it with a private loan or out of pocket, which I'd rather not do/cannot do if I can avoid it.

A friend and I were talking about the marriage exception as a joke. Except now it's less of a joke.  Marriage licenses are cheaper than a seafood boil here and I'm seriously considering marrying him just for FAFSA, and then divorcing after I get my degree. I know the question of marriage to complete FAFSA has been asked here before, but the answers were largely unhelpful so I want some honest feedback. We both have a negative net worth so I'm assuming splitting assets and finances shouldn't be an issue if we divorce, although within the next few years that could change if he starts making more. Is this a stupid idea? It seems to good to be true and I'm wondering if this is something that could bite me in the ass further down the line. Is there something I'm overlooking if we decide to do this? I feel like I'm running out of options and don't want to forego going to college. Any good faith input would be greatly appreciated  :)",EditorMedical6161,15,34,0.84

674,Starting university (again) at age 22 and feeling like a total failure / looser about it,10zg36e,"  

I am 21 right and will be entering University next September at age 22. No matter how hard I try not think about it / think about it positively I can’t help but feel like a looser about it. 

I know that thinking about the past isn’t a healthy thing to do, but I can’t help but feel a huge regret about wasting the past 3 years of my life. I went to 3 different colleges, each for a different major but I didn’t like any of them and ended up dropping out 3 whole times.

I know that it is too late and I should think about the future and not the past, but when I think about the future all I think about is the fact that no matter how hard I study during the next years, no matter how hard I try to correct my past mistakes, it won’t change the fact that I will be graduating at age 26, and that thought makes me feel like shit.

I have always been a very competitive and ambitious person, I had everything to succeed, but depression got to me and Basically wasted 3 years of my life.

I will be 22 studying with 18 years. I will graduate 3 years later than people my age. And I can’t do nothing about it. 

People say age doesn’t matter and what not, truth is it does. People in my class will look at me weird, I will still be in university while my friends have graduated long ago and are making good money, women my age will not date because will still be a student at the age of 26, my parents are ashamed of me because I had everything to succeed and didn’t.

The truth is I know that my situation is bad and there is no way I can’t turn this into a good thing, I also know that I can’t do anything to make things better. I try not to think about it but I can't.",Trick_Repair_5270,82,32,0.7

678,having a hard time accepting my college decision...nearly a year later,10zdrxm,"So it's late at night and of course that means it's time to spiral into overthinking about every decision made ever. Tonight the topic is college. I'm currently a freshman at my state school, the last school I ever wanted to go to. My dream for college was to get out of the place I always lived, start a brand new life of my own. I worked pretty hard in high school, got good grades and test scores and whatnot. Kind of dropped the ball when it came to college apps, I think I was getting burned out. 

Anyway, despite that, I was still accepted to pretty much the perfect school for my personal goals: NYU Shanghai. I always wanted to study abroad (particularly in Asia), and the emphasis on diversity at NYU really appealed to me. I was also interested in the idea of being able to get a degree from both the US and China, which would open doors to having an international career (my ultimate dream). Combine that with pretty much being forced to learn Mandarin, a language I would love to learn.....it checked every single box. It was pretty much the ticket to the life of my dreams. 

Except my family is poor to say the least, and I was offered hardly any financial aid. It was a pathetic, sad dent in the 70k annual price tag.

I did the responsible thing. With a heavy heart, I let the chance go.

And now here I am, still, one year later stuck on the idea of it. How different my life could have been if I grabbed the opportunity while it was there. Just took on the debt. Who knows, maybe I would end up with a job where paying it off wouldn't be so unreasonable. However unlikely. Essentially, I don't know how to cope with it. Willingly giving up something I so desperately wanted for myself. And it also just felt like a total injustice working so hard, being so stressed... just to go to the same state school as everyone else. I question the point of it all.

I don't want to ruin college for myself by thinking this way. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any words of advice? My dream of working internationally seems so unattainable now. It feels like no matter what I do, I'll end up stuck in the same place again.

I don't viscerally hate him or anything, he just is not the type of people I like to hang out with ; I'm a pretty introverted kind of person, I enjoy peace and quiet, while he is more of an extrovert, always energetic and talks a lot. Again, I don't hate this kind of people, I just don't click super well with them. M and I also don't have a lot of common interests (if any).

Despite our clashing personalities, he seems to have taken a liking to me ? Ever since I met him, he started always sitting next to me in lectures, always insisting to be paired with me for group projects, and will always come running up to me when he sees me walking on campus (or in town). I was willing to try being his friend at first, but I really.. can't.

Being with M really takes a lot of my energy, because he talks *a lot* (he can often go on for an hour without interruption). I have already told him that I didn't like that and that I needed some quiet. He'd apologize every time, only to.. immediately resume monologuing ? I don't know how to make myself clearer. Sometimes I just tell him ""Sorry I don't feel like talking right now"" but he seems to be ignoring my requests to be left alone..

M has been making a lot of comments on stuff I'm sensitive about (my body). Again, when I told him that made me feel hurt, he laughed and said that I should ""learn to take a joke"" (which is probably true though).

M is also a really touchy/huggy kind of guy, and I absolutely *hate* physical contact. Again, despite me telling him this multiple times, he keeps trying to touch me (not in a sexual way, just like, hugs and back pats). Even a firm ""Stop !"" doesn't seem to be enough to get him to, well, stop.

I don't know what to do to get him to leave me alone. I have, more than once, clearly (I think ?) told him that I didn't like the way he behaves with me, but he doesn't seem to take that into consideration.

712,feasibility of switching to a science major/career?,10yqi80,"TLDR: How feasible is it to switch from a humanities major like the undermentioned to a science major like biology/biochem, especially in the first 2 years of college?

Here's a bit on my situation:

I am a high school senior with many broad interests. My favorite classes at school have always been bio/chem and English, although I've loved every subject I've taken (excluding a bad experience with physics). While my peers were deciding what major/specialization to apply for, I was still trying to decide between STEM and the humanities. Ultimately, I chose to apply for business and social science programs (e.g. intl relations, economics, psychology).

I did this because I felt the opportunity cost of choosing STEM was greater than choosing a humanities-based major, as creativity/eloquence are my strengths and public speaking is a passion of mine. However, I am constantly regretting not even trying for a STEM major like biology, especially because STEM subjects always came naturally to me. All I want at this point in my life is to find enjoyment in my career without, ya know, going broke.

I have constantly heard that it is easier to switch from STEM to humanities than vice versa, but I'm really hoping to have the choice to try out or switch to biology at some point in my first half of college.

I am looking at schools in the US and Canada. Thanks in advance for any help/advice!",onyxhvn,9,5,0.84

The priority deadline is in mid March for Autumn quarter.  The problem is I barely have $7k in savings, make part time minimum wage, I only get $6k a year for FAFSA loans because my parents make $100k+ a year, and those parents won’t sign a PLUS loan because “it will look bad on our credit”.  The cost of attendance is estimated to be $31k per year and none of the grants, scholarships, or anything replied to my applications; probably not helped by the fact that I’m a straight white guy from financially unhealthy middle class parents.  

Part of the reason why I want to transfer soon is because I’d also finally be moving out of my parents for the first time, not to mention I’d be finishing the degree sooner.  Do I apply now before I know if I can afford to attend and just try to get private loans or take a break and save up or what?

720,Are there any college programs that are more self-paced? Unique universities good for neurodivergent people?,10yiq3e,"I have been really struggling with school the past 3 years and I'm just so exhausted. For some context, I was recently diagnosed with cyclothymia, which is on the bipolar spectrum but the hypomanic and depressed symptoms are less severe and the cycle happens more frequently than in other bipolar disorders. 

I'm realizing that school is a big trigger for me in both directions - I start the quarter really high energy, extremely productive, etc., and then in the middle, I get really depressed and don't have the energy to do much of anything, then race to catch up the last couple of days and miraculously pass due to generous and understanding professors. And the worst part is, I'm not actually learning anything. I really care about school; I'm passionate about it and *want* an education. But because of my mental illness, I feel like I'm just wasting energy, effort, time, and money and not getting what I want to get out of it. 

I'm planning to take the next quarter off and go to an intensive outpatient program (IOP) to really focus on my mental health and hopefully get a handle on everything. But after that, I just feel so defeated, I don't think I have the energy to go back to school right now. 

I'm making this post because I don't feel like the stereotypical, American school system is working for me anymore and I'm just wondering if there are some other options out there. In my ideal world, I would be able to learn when I have the energy, and then focus on other things when I am depressed, and then be able to go back to it and not feel entirely behind. Is there anything like that that exists? Or any other non-traditional options that I can explore?

Also, I know bipolar isn't technically neurodivergent but I decided to put it in the title anyway so people understood the kind of question I was asking.

729,Is it normal for University dining to not tell you what they are charging for your food?,10yeru7,"It's my first semester being in a dorm and having a meal plan. There's multiple dining halls that anyone can go to get food. I noticed the Chick-Fil-a is the only place I've been to that has a visible screen and will say ""that is $\_\_\_\_\_"". All the other places don't say anything, no screen, no receipt, only prices listed on drinks and on shelf items (not even online menu shows prices). Only when I ask is when I know what I am paying from my meal plan.

I just decided to get 8 piece chicken wings and a 20oz soda just now. Last time I got that was from another dining hall and I expected to pay about $14 ($2.90 for soda \[that's listed on the cooler and same price as other halls\] and about $10 for the wings). The cashier charged me $22.38! I was able to see the register at this one and noticed she charged me $4.30 for the soda and $16 for the wings (that where cold).

i was sitting on a bench alone, waiting for my ride to come. this guy approached me and asked how was i etc. he asked for my name so i told him and asked him back. he kept on going on about how my name sounds so american (im asian and my birth name HAS an american name), and how he hated his name because it sounds hispanic. mind you, it was my first few weeks in the US. im like totally lost and not sure how to reply him. almost immediately, he recognized that i was an international student (from my spoken english). he also said he liked my glasses…. like what a weird compliment to give but sure??

then i asked him what he was majoring in (he said he was taking only one class), and he asked me back. i said “biology”. we talked a bit on where i wanted to transfer etc then he asked if he could get my number. i thought nothing of it and just gave him my number since ‘oh, first new friend here’ but after that, here’s where it gets a little uncomfy

he asked how old i was, and i said 20. and when i asked him back, he said “if i tell u, u are gonna run away”. like what?? is this a red flag?? i know cc welcomes people of all ages and there is a guy thats 40+ in my class so why is he being so secretive? 

then he asked about my favorite food / drinks and said he would wanna drive / take me out someday to have one of those… sounds a little sus like why would i when i’ve barely met u?

then he started talking about bio since im majoring in it. i wasnt interested in talking anymore si i kept giving vague answers like idk, maybe, ill see how. then he asked me “so what does bio say about men and women?” like huh??? what kind of question is that? so i just said “reproduce” and he laughed??? i felt iffy and wanted to excuse myself so i said i needed to go to which he said, “i can text u right”. i said sure cause i wanted to get out asap and then he said “even at midnight?” i just laughed a bit and walked off.

sure enough a few hours later, he texted. i ignored. another text, ignored. “i like your glasses”, ignored. the next day, another text. i was so done so i just said wrong number. he stopped.

today, i was sitting and waiting for my ride again at a different spot and damn! he was walking towards me. “remember me? u gave me the wrong number”. so i just said oh sorry actually, i cant really remember my number. he started talking to me and god, i was making almost zero eye contact so why cant he pick up the hint? he asked for my socials so i just said i dont use. then he wanted me to take his number and i was like, actually i prefer not to. here, he said he gotta go and left. i think he finally got it?

what is he trying to do here? is this normal to ask strangers for their number? (i dont consider myself attractive looking) im new here so any advice / insight would be great.

edit: didnt expect to get so much attention but thanks for all the advice. i would like to just emphasize one more time, i am not from around here. i come from a rather conservative (and extremely safe) asian country and usually people just mind their own business and wont bother talking to strangers. having someone approach me out of nowhere is very unfamiliar to me and plus im still adjusting to life here. in any case, i will be more cautious in the future and stay safe!",anononyy,84,158,0.88
735,Attention Vs Note Taking,10ybu8f,"I'm posting this as I believe we as students need to change the way we take notes.

To this day I've never really a big notetaker in school. Back then it was because I was just lazy but now it's another reason.

I'm in college right now and whenever I go to my lectures I almost always never take notes. Reason being is that I believe that attention to the subject is far more important to developing a deep understanding of the subject.

The traditional style of taking notes to me is just a game of matching the pace of which you write at with the speed of which the lecturer talks at. This becomes less about learning and more about writing when practiced.

I've gotten far more out of lecture's from simply giving the professor my undivided attention while only taking note of concepts that are going to be important and concepts that I don't understand in order to review them later on.

In the age of the internet, professors almost always post their lecture slides/notes online which ultimately render copying slides useless. In the case that the covers something that isn't in the lecture slides available online, you can always make an audio recording of that lecture to refer to it in the case that you don't understand something or need to go back.

My college does thing a little different we have the Fall and spring semester but they are divided into the short and long section I am currently in the short section, it last 2 months. So it's the same work as a normal semester except in half the time. For what ever reason I have to take two ""writing intense"" on my humanist class I am on track to get an ""A"", on the other hand my Art class has me fucked up. The absurd amount of writing has made me hate Art in general. For example one of the weekly assignment is to describe the art I see, write 4 pages of 3 pieces of art including sources, and research.  And that's only worth a point, after that the massive amount of reading summarizing, projects and other things. All sum up it's about 12 pages per week and add my life and suddenly I don't have time to even catch up.

The whole semester I've been trying to catch up as assignments come day after day, got sick? well you are now a week behind. 

I'm already guaranteed to have a seat with the program for Fall 2023 so in all honestly passing or failing this class would not affect me in the grand sense of it all. I will just have to take an extra class in the future to make up the credit for a Bachelor degree in Finance.

But above all of this is the fact hat I entered in 2019, did a year with an average of 89, covid comes I stayed out of school for two semester (mental health got bad)  came back, and now  all of this ends with me not getting a degree, having a 7 month gap till my third year and now I have to blindside my family.",GodofLumberjacks,0,2,1.0

747,Pre-Calculus Algebra and Trigonometry combined over the summer?,10y69ep,"Hey guys, I am currently in College Algebra, I am looking at taking this combined class so I can then move onto Calc 1 this Fall semester, I am wondering if you guys might advise against doing this? I know since it will be a summer class, the subjects will be thrown at us quicker. I plan to dedicate a lot of time to this as I am majoring in physics and would need a firm grasp of math. 

I just want to make sure that I have the foundation of math I need to continue on, I will also be taking a general Chemistry 1 with this class.",hunterscodes,5,1,1.0
748,Anxiety during class?,10y686c,"Bit off topic but I'll bite. 

In class sometimes when the material is complicated I go into extreme anxiety where my chest is tight and I start getting distressed. It started like 2 weeks ago and its gotten so bad my professors and even other students start to notice I'm distressed. Yesterday had to pop two anxiety pills in class and they kind of work. 

&#x200B;

Is it normal to feel this in hard classes? If so what do you do to manage it? It is really messing me up and I don't want my professors/peers thinking I am some psychopath.

749,Enrolled For Life?,10y5lr1,"Does anyone know of somebody who is just always taking a course? Like I see middle aged adults around campus who are students and have been for years. They just like learning and taking courses. Anyone younger do this? Thoughts?

I'm 26 and I've been quite nostalgic about college lately. Is this weird?",huntercolej,4,2,1.0
750,How do I ask for a semester break from college?,10y2qkb,"I'm currently in my second year of university and for this upcoming summer and fall semester I just want to take a break from school and work to save up money so that I can transfer to a new university. My only question is do I need to withdraw from my current university? Will this affect me in any way, and if, for some reason, I don't go to a new university will I be able to go back to my old one?

I'm sure I'm going to follow up with this plan but I just don't know who to talk to and maybe because I need to talk to someone who can help me make sure I want to do this.",A7_drew7,4,5,1.0
