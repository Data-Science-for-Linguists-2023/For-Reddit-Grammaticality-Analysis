2,I went to the supermarket here in Venezuela and paid directly with Bitcoin,11vnevt,"Hi guys, as you probably know I'm Venezuelan living here.

Yesterday I had the chance of doing some purchases in a supermarket and paying directly in Bitcoin.

This was the purchase:

[The purchase \(I had purchased some things before, like fruits and vegetables in farmers market and chicken\/meat\)](https://preview.redd.it/skjk96ln8poa1.jpg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3cec664b803e9a3d48b8db7be0afc339fc5f7b5d)

&#x200B;

You say to the cashier you want to pay in cryptocurrency and their system shows them a selection:

&#x200B;

[The amount is shown in Bolivares \(Bs.\) so 725 Bs.  so 30 USD \(exchange rate is 1 USD 24.2 Bs.\)](https://preview.redd.it/mrh1wr9h9poa1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2f7f43d84b812ec9e3f5b71cd5d3a78870b756f0)

They say they will add more crypto and BTC LN.

After selecting bitcoin and and continue (Continuar) it shows the amount in bitcoin

&#x200B;

[So that is, 0.00124813 BTC, yesterday it was very volatile so even when BTC was around 27,200 USD using that rate I paid around 34 USD. Not much sense there, 4 USD more I suspect it s a fixed fee, wouldn't make sense be 10&#37;. After I took the picture he went again there and final price was 0.00124863 BTC.](https://preview.redd.it/74ejomjz9poa1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=07c559dccf2f0d573de93d1e6572ba4843032456)

After that it shows a QR code, you scan it and have to wait for at least one confirmation after you get one confirmation (mine took several minutes) the cashier press payment received and I suppose it checks one blockchain explorer for one confirmation or pending transaction that matches the amount. If it matches it says payment received and receipt is printed.

I noticed each time you press continuar a new QR code gets generated, so new or different address.

I used Trust Wallet and the fee was 1.36 USD.

Receipt is shown in Bolivares, but that is common here even if you pay with USD, Euros or any currency the invoice will be printed in Bolivares.

Experience was good overall, but in this case I paid a little more, something to improve.

You have to remember that here the economy is destroyed:

&#x200B;

* Monthly inflation can be over 10% easily. Being it under 10% is a success.
* Monthly minimum wage is 130 Bs. (less than 5 USD, this purchase was 5x monthly minimum wage), average monthly wage is 120 USD.
* Since 2007 14 zeroes were removed from the currency, so this 725 Bs would have been 72,500,000,000,000,000

3,Having An Emergency Fund Is One Of The Most Important Parts Of Investing In Crypto,11vqd67,"I rarely hear people recommend having an emergency fund before starting to invest in crypto. Before doing it, we should have an emergency fund to have our ass covered just in case we lose our job, we have to pay medical bills, car/house appliance repairs, or maybe if the financial system collapse with the bank runs like we are in risk right now.

There is no specific amount of money that you have to have because that amount has to be according to your needs and situation. In my case, I only maintain the amount necessary to survive without work and paying all expenses for 4 months. To some it may seem little but in my case I consider that being a Software Developer the risk of losing my job and not finding another quickly is very low. Also, I don't have children so I don't have to save as much.

[Emergency Fund](https://preview.redd.it/3owlmbrk5qoa1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1c3148348aecb4c00762bebd7c03cb52634047b)

Thank you very much for reading this post and I hope it reminded you that it is important to have a safeguard.

4,I just realized i lost about 900$,11vw1ps,"I was kinda active at one time in here, moved my moons to a non-custodial wallet and during the bear-market(and life-things) didn't pay much mind or attention to this community.

Today here i am, reading the post about moons hitting 0,34$ and not believeing that i have about 900$ worth of moons.

5,Scam Warning: We have seen dozens of Arbitrum Airdrop scammers in the past few days,11vvp9z,"With many big crypto events, scammers will be trying to steal your money. With the announcement of Arbitrum's airdrop, scammers are hoping to capitalize on the complexity of crypto and users excited for free money.  Here's how this one works on reddit:

1. The scammers setup fake ""Arbitrum"" twitter profiles with links to fake Arbitrum websites or contract addresses. Most likely it requests access to your MetaMask and steals all your money.
2. They buy a bunch of reddit or twitter accounts
3. They spam crypto reddit with posts like the one below

https://preview.redd.it/q0f9ufd4vqoa1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3f338ca32bb537161aa096955a10aada0bf6bb76

Notice:

* The link text says it is going to the official arbitrum twitter account, but when you hover over the link it is going to a different account.
* If you click into the user's profile, you'll see their history is empty, has nothing to do with crypto, or they are spamming this link across many subreddits. It will look nothing like organic user activity.
* They are offering free money which appeals to people's greed and lowers their inhibitions.
* They may use deadlines or ""act now!"" language to create a sense of urgency, making you click the link before you think about if it is legitimate.

&#x200B;

A scammer might not have any of these red flags, but if you see these red flags it's certainly time to be very very suspicious. If you are looking for information about something like arbitrum's airdrop, use their official website. If you are involved with arbitrum, it's probably a good idea to have bookmarked their website, otherwise you may search for it later and click a phishing ad by mistake.",CryptoMaximalist,70,29,0.97
6,"What’s your expectation of cryptocurrency in 2029, Bitcoin’s 20th year of existence?",11vqh35,"I have a few: 

- The top 100 marketcap cryptos will be vastly different from today’s. 

- There will be a large retail bank that lets you hold Bitcoin and/or eth as freely as an ordinary CEX (you can buy and sell directly from the bank, withdraw to a non-custodial wallet). 

- A large CEX (Coinbase, Kraken, or Binance) will receive a bank charter license. 

- Another large CEX will pull a FTX. 

- Pokémon has finally released their blockchain related project. 

- This sub has over 12 million subscribers. 

- Microsoft’s Edge wallet becomes the unofficial “risk wallet”, where most people only use a portion of their funds for defi permissions and leave the rest in unbothered cold storage. 

- More than half of the popular social media platforms have a crypto wallet, including a new, trendy, one. 

- Layer 4s are a thing.",genjitenji,119,38,0.84
7,"Trust me, babe, I will use the pullout method (for my crypto)",11vk3si,"Listen, babe, everyone knows that using protection from the start doesn't feel as good. Like, sure, I could just get everything onto my Ledger. Wrap it up, as they say. Yeah, some people do that.

But that isn't as much fun.

I'm a crypto giga-Chad. Trust me, babe, I'm good at the pullout method. Like, I read the markets all the time. I know what I'm doing. It's my account, so I know when I'm getting close to disaster. I always pullout my crypto, I don't lose control in the heat of the moment.

Have I done some edging that got me dangerously close? Oh, sure. I barely pulled out of Celsius in time. I felt that crash coming, so right before it all would have burst, I pulled out my crypto. It got my heart rate up and it made me feel alive. It was wild.

I'm good like that, babe, trust me. Trust me to use the pullout method with my crypto.

What? Other guys you've been with don't complain when they're told to use a Ledger or a Trezor? Well, I'm not like other guys. I like the rush, I need the rush, and when I'm purely in the moment like that--raw--you'll have a better time, too. Trust me.

What's that? Some of the Chads in your life didn't pullout of Voyager? One of them didn't pullout of that Squidgame bullshit? Mt. Gox?

Babe, they weren't Chads, then. When you're with me, it's a different experience.

8,"If people ask me how bitcoin works, I have found a lot of success using this explanation. Feel free to use it yourself.",11vobdz,"1. First method is just don't do it. Don't bother. No seriously, Most of the time they don't care. They are just looking for an opportunity to sneer and make fun of you for buying magic beans. Tuipmania, blah blah blah. 
2. But if they actually are interested in how crypto works because they don't get it and want you to explain then this explanation has always worked for me. It's not perfect but it usually makes people understand *why* bitcoin has value without boring technical jargon:

Imagine you are tasked with creating a list. The list has to have some very special properties. Anybody can add to the list. But nobody can rearrange the list or delete an item off of it. It needs to be *decentralized*.

You might think to put the list on a website so that everybody has access to it. It's a good start but whoever owns the server on which the website resides could easily delete the list or alter it so this won't work. That's not decentralized.

So then you might think to distribute that website across millions of different servers with different owners. All the servers talk to each other to update the list when something is added and they all talk to each other to agree what the list is so if anybody tries to delete the list or alter it on their server, the rest of the servers will know and ignore their changes.

Great! problem solved!

But why would anyone be motivated to run one of these servers? What's in it for them? Well, you could pay them but if you ever stopped paying them you could essentially shut down the servers and delete the list. It's still centralized. 

What if the program paid them in its own made up money that it made out of thin air?....

That does solve the centralization problem. But why would anybody want fake money?

Well if there is a market need for a list with these properties and the only way this service can meet that need is if people get paid in the fake money then that fake money necessarily needs to take on value.

Ok, what's the market need? What does this list do that is so valuable?

It keeps track of who has how much of the fake money...

The market need is for a decentralized currency that is fairly distributed and decentralized. Thus the fake money takes on value because there is demand for the special properties associated with it by the list it runs on. The more demand there is for this kind of currency with the inherent properties of the list, the more value it takes on. 

The list is called the block chain and the currency is called bitcoin.

Anyways, that spiel has worked wonders for me. I know there is obviously so much more to say and you will be tempted to add more detail or change the metaphor to be more specific but I promise this method works on normies. Hope it helps someone.",AverageLiberalJoe,94,45,0.82
9,Coinbase is looking for a new overseas headquarters due to restrictions in the United States.,11uycvy,"**The company is seeking a new platform for cryptocurrency trading abroad because of increased regulatory scrutiny by American regulators.**

According to Bloomberg sources, Coinbase has informed its institutional clients of its intention to create a new trading platform abroad. Due to a strict regulatory environment, the United States is making it difficult for cryptocurrency companies to conduct business.

The community believes that the US is missing out on cryptocurrency innovation due to its tough stance.

# Coinbase is planning diversification abroad. 

The exchange wants to create an alternative location independent of the main Coinbase market. Emilie Choi, the Chief Operating Officer, said:

>""International expansion will continue to be a significant part of our business.""

There is no confirmation yet regarding the location of the new platform, but countries such as the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, and Hong Kong, which are racing to become cryptocurrency hubs, are potential candidates.

Earlier, BeInCrypto reported that Coinbase intends to expand internationally within the next eight weeks and will start with Singapore.

Coinbase wrote in its letter to investors for the fourth quarter: 

>""It is disappointing that regulatory bodies do not necessarily support transparency and public participation in rule-making. Especially agencies in the United States present an inconsistent position towards cryptocurrencies, which pushes the industry overseas.""

# Continuing the fight against cryptocurrencies in the United States

As cryptocurrency-friendly banks such as Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Silvergate Bank fall, new obstacles emerge for Web3 industry firms. Regulators have reportedly demanded that banks bidding on Signature Bank ""give up the entire cryptocurrency business.""

Some state officials blame cryptocurrencies for the decline of banks.

12,Buying Moons on Sushi Swap with Metamask: how to switch your ETH from the Ethereum Main Network to the Arbitrum Nova Network.,11vqbbo,"Today I successfully bought my first Moons through Sushi Swap. I wanted to do this for months, but after reading most posts on this subreddit there were some pieces of the puzzle missing. I was hesitant. When people talk about Sushi Swap it's easy to forget that Moons are on the Arbitrum Nova Blockchain, and the ETH you want to spend is living on the ETH Mainnet. 

The piece I'm talking about is that only once you connect your wallet (Metamask), you have the option to switch through the available chains in your Metamask wallet. Soon I realized that the ETH showing in the ETH Main Network was 0.00 on the Arbitrum Network. This is where [www.bridge.arbitrum.io](http://bridge.arbitrum.io) comes into play. Go to the site and, connect your wallet. The UI is super straightforward, select from: Mainnet (Layer1)  to: Arbitrum Nova (Layer2). Insert the amount you want to transfer, scroll down and click Move funds to. 

You will have to wait about 15 exciting minutes before the transfer succeeds, so grab a drink and a snack in the meantime. On the bridge website it will update itself and whend completed displays ""succeeded"" on the transaction. 

Now all you need to do is go back to [Sushi Swap](https://www.sushi.com/swap), select the Arbitrum Nova Network again, and Eureka! The default Sushi on the homepage had switched to WBTC, and if you search for MOONS they finally show up in the results. Confirm and exchange your ETH for those divine MOONS.

I'm sure there's more budget friendly options to buy MOONS besides with ETH, but I wanted to try Sushi for a long time. I hope this helps fellow beginners out with what should be a pretty generic operation in the world of crypto. 

In terms of fees I payed about about €3.5 in fees on a €50 Moon purchase, which isn't too bank breaking. 

Because I'm not used to trading, I started out with transferring €11€ worth of ETH (0.007 at the time of writing) to my Metamask wallet, to make sure it worked. I ended up receiving €3.33 in the correct wallet, making it an expensive test. But at least I was confident in transferring the next higher amount. I made sure to save the address of the transaction to avoid mistakes for further transactions. 

For my FOMO Budds: these are expensive times to buy MOONS. In no way I'm advising you to open sushi swap and try it right away. For me €50 Is a significant amount to spend on ""lucrative expenses"" like Moons,  on a monthly perspective. This was personally something I wanted to try for a long time, since the Arbitrum Nova Network. Without [www.bridge.arbitrum.io](http://bridge.io) and it's user friendly UI, this would have been a less smoother experience. 

To end of, Shitposting is still king, and that will be my main income of MOONS.I'm also here for the technology, so being able to do this from my couch was a wholesome experience. It is no very far from other payments systems that we already use. Which makes it even more exciting.",poeselkots,93,20,0.74
13,I’m a random degen crypto investor like the lot of you who got a taste of financial freedom.,11vvees,"Been in crypto since 2017 and got hooked by the tech (honestly). I knew it was revolutionary back then and not a single hair on my head that thinks otherwise today. Had my fair share of losses, exchanges getting hacked or just ran with all the cash (mf Firano), lost a lot of money in the process but my goal was clear and I suppose after the first bear my crypto-cherry got popped pretty quickly so it felt easy to lose money and deal with the crazy volatility after that. I honestly think that to make money in this game you really need to be a degen because I’m pretty sure “normal” people fold their cards way to fast due to the crazy volatility and 99% scams. As soon as I got passed the $100k unrealized profits with like $20k input my brain wanted to talk rational. Or should I say emotional because that’s what makes people sell. 


Anyhow, I just want to say thank you crypto for making this possible. I know there are more like me and to the people who want to make it you will be surprised where you will be 10 years from now.
I know it’s boasting but we are all anonymous so who cares? I can’t tell my family or friends about it and I don’t know why but I feel the need to tell you what crypto has made possible for me personally. 


You have been warned, it’s utter degen talk down below… :)


So here it goes…


First my goal was $100k, then it became $500k and now I’m aiming for $1mil.
Once I got passed $500k I already witnessed a bear so I knew to take profits, in the last bull run I got lucky with NFT’s and cashed out like $200k to keep in fiat, and wait for the bear to come. I still have like $80k in fiat (DCA’d quite a bit), close to $500k in BTC, ETH and other alts that I think will make it… and maybe XMR.


I guess after all the holding and believing and listening to people crypto has no future I said fuck it, time to realize some gains and give ourselves some nice treats. 


As a real gamer and tech savvy pretty much the first thing I bought once I reached life changing money ($500k milestone) was the best gaming PC possible, and a 4k beamer to stream them. Got some back issues so I bought myself a chair with those cool buttons that make you go “Aaaaaaaah”.
Sound systems in my house, got top tier gaming headsets and the best peripherals to go with gaming PC’s (racing seat and steering wheel, couch co-op keyboards, Hotas flight stick :D). PS5, got it… Switch, got it… Steam deck, fuck it… $4.5k gaming laptop for when I work abroad. IPad pro 3rd gen for banking and easy transport… new phone, new smartwatch for running.

15,Let's not kid ourselves - We are very far from mass adoption,11vpv7b,"Disclaimer: I am super bullish on crypto and I hope it can revolutionize the broken financial system but…

After the events in the past weeks, people in this sub have become extremely bullish again on crypto. Posts are popping up here that discuss that it is  crypto's time to shine in the light of the recent bank crisis and that the recent market pump can be taken as evidence that people are flocking towards crypto because of this. 

Let's be honest though, crypto mass adoption is not happening anytime soon. Here are some reasons: 

* Nations or large institutions have no to reason to adopt crypto - In the end its all about **control** and they are not willing to give that up 

* Fiat rules the world - this is not changing anytime soon -

* Many people investing in crypto do it just because of the money - they couldn't care less about the revolutionary aspects of crypto (anecdotal point from the very few people that I have who actually own some crypto)

* In the public eye, crypto is often still considered a joke or a scam 
* Using crypto is way too complicated for most people 
* Active bitcoin addresses today were only at 1m

* Binance the largest trading platform by far “only” has 120m users

Of course adoption is happening and is only increasing every year. But for **mass** adoption to happen would mean for most people to actually care and for institutions to give up their control.",Killertimme,75,22,0.71
16,Another way of writing down your seed phrases,11vjfo0,"When you create a new wallet, you are always asked to write down your seed phrase. With that experience, when you see somewhere a list of 12 or 24 words, you automatically think this is a seed phrase someone lost or shared by mistake.

Using basic encryption, you can protect your seed phrase from \*\*some\*\* bad actors. Keep in mind that basic encryption doesn't guarantee your seed phrase is safe. However, it may help filter out those who are inexperienced.

The seed phrase is a set of 12 or 24 words from the BIP39 word list. The list is standardized and consists of 2048 unique words, meaning each word has its own index in the list, e.g. abandon = 1, choice = 322, etc. The full word list can be found here: [https://privacypros.io/bip39-word-list/](https://privacypros.io/bip39-word-list/)

If you replace your seed phrases with those numbers, you can introduce a layer of security.

Example seed phrase:

    timber sword where noodle joy eagle admit tuna vibrant museum gossip river

Result:

    1810 1763 2003 1201 965 553 30 1876 1948 1166 808 1495

For the person without experience, it will be quite hard to grasp what that list is and how to use it. This could be improved even further e.g. by merging the list into a huge single number that would make no sense to even more bad actors. However, it would also mean that we would have problems decrypting it because we wouldn't know where the current index ends and the new one starts. As I mentioned above, the list of words is standardized (it won't change), so it is safe to assume that each word from the list is identified by a maximum of 4 digits, and indexes with less digits could be converted to 4 by simply prepending 0 to them. So index 1 becomes 0001, index 64 becomes 0064, and index 986 becomes 0986. Given the same seed phrase, the result would look like this:

    1810 1763 2003 1201 0965 0553 0030 1876 1948 1166 0808 1495

And then you can write down the encrypted phrase as:

    181017632003120109650553003018761948116608081495

If you would like to give it a try, please make sure you can decrypt the phrase before ditching the list of the words you have. Just repeat the instructions in reverse order.

The recorded message informed me of a change in my email address and gave me two options: either press one to authorize the change or wait in line to speak with a customer service representative.

This is concerning that I haven't heard of these types of calls for quite some time. It makes me suspect that the caller may have either resumed their activity or obtained a new list of potential targets, Especially given the data breach that affected many others in the cryptocurrency community who use Ledger.

I think we should all exercise caution and remain vigilant when receiving unsolicited phone calls or messages claiming to be from financial institutions or other organizations.

One thing I've learned the hard way:  the price of the things currently in your portfolio is largely irrelevant.  What is relevant is the price that you got when you sold, versus the price that you paid when you bought.   

Everything else in between is largely entertainment, .    

There is a lot of fluff being posted that is clearly appealing to base emotions, and a lot of emotional response.   Experience tells me that a froth is coming.  Could be upside froth, could be downside froth.  It's really hard to tell whether the powers behind it are positioning to exit into liquidity, or drawing in more interest to exit later. Could be more than one and could be both... froth is like that.  I am very concerned (given sanctions etc.) that we could have state or state-sponsored actors engaged here.  If that's the case, we're like frogs in a swimming pool with hippos, and that's a recipe to get flattened or sloshed far out onto dry land.  So while I'm with everyone else giddy at the expectation of rising prices, my Spidey sense is tingling.

Please set realistic goals for yourself.,11vlyv9,"Just a heads up to anyone who expects to get rich by investing small amounts of money... Bottom line, it's not realistic. Big reward is almost always tied to big risk.

&#x200B;

And that's not to say investing small isn't a good reason to invest! If you have 20 dollars in your pocket that you'd like to see grow, then in all honesty - crypto is probably the best way to see larger future returns over any other method....

&#x200B;

Hell I got into this game because investing in the stock market was a bit too difficult and overwhelming to get started. Not to mention that in most cases, you need thousands of dollars to open a securities account... With crypto, you don't need to have a large amount of capital to dip your toes, which made it extremely attractive to me.

That said, make sure that you're not buying into low cap shit coins in the hopes that maybe one day it'll moon-shot to BTC's price...

23,Has Crypto changed your outlook?,11vqkh4,"Hi all,

Has crypto changed your general outlook to finances, and also life in general?

For me I have seen more value in managing my own security and taking the reasonability into my own hands. Forced by my cold wallet and creating safe backups for those wallets. While there is a load more responsibility I find it comforting that the security is down to me. I have now moved away from cloud storage services in general and onto my own network attached storage. It is more work but having the responsibility mainly lie with myself and the data in my own possession has been oddly rewarding. 

I certainly do not have financial freedom. But I certainly have a heightened interest in my finances. After going through many complex transactions in crypto the idea of changing bank to a better interest rate or benefit is not  daunting at all. I feel much happier to put a little work in to benefit myself. I used to just leave everything as it was, couldn't be bothered.

The more I learn about this, the more I realize that if the long-term theses of Bitcoin and Etherium will likely take several decades to play out (if they actually do - this is still a risky investment). The majority of people who achieve life-changing wealth will be those who:

* Gradually accumulate blue-chips.
* Prioritize their emergency fund so that if something happens they don't need to sell their crypto.
* Prioritize security (storing assets in cold storage and appropriately managing their seed phrase) and be vigilant of scams so they don't lose their crypto.
* Avoid selling on emotion just because they are deep in the red.
* Continue to hold while the media tells them Bitcoin is dead (again)
* Continue to hold while their family and friends, who they made the mistake of telling, ask them about crypto and laugh at them following a bear market.

We will start families and watch our children grow up. We will move house and have to be careful to not lose our seed phrase. Adoption will take place and Bitcoin will keep ticking while our bodies age and the world changes around us. There will be scams, controversies, and short-lived fads. There may be years on end where the Bitcoin price stays flat or even slowly decreases.

BTC's market share has increased after the coin surpassed $27,000 this week, marking its highest level since June. This is a significant increase compared to the two-month low below $20,000 two weeks ago, which was caused by broader risk aversion due to a series of US bank failures, including Silicon Valley and Silvergate, the two largest banks supporting cryptocurrencies and technology.

Nexo has long been regarded as a rather sketchy lending platform and came under extremely heavy scrutiny at around the time of the Celsius as people were fleeing lending platforms en-masse as trust was shattered and people feared losing their funds

One instance of bad news which I personally didn't believe that Nexo would overcome was a raid on their offices earlier this year. However this seemed to turn out just fine for Nexo (in the short term at least) and in rebuttal, Nexo said that they would be suing the Bulgarian government because of their actions, calling them “shameful” and was preparing to file a lawsuit against the government seeking damages. During this time, Nexo saw a huge wave of withdrawals make their way out of their lending platform yet they weathered the storm and are still here today, seemingly being left rather unscathed by the entire experience.

A second rather large case for Nexo recently has been their battle with the SEC in America. Now, nobody is ever surprised when the SEC stick their nose into crypto and try to shake the foundations but this time they got a bite and Nexo agreed to pay a total of $45 million to US regulators to settle claims that it failed to register the sale of its Earn Interest Product (EIP). This is a HUGE sum of money to be shelling out at a time of great uncertainty yet Nexo are still here, remaining somewhat unshaken.

These few points are but a drop in the ocean for Nexo as a company and I'm sure that a lot of people here have more tales to tell regarding the company and more opinions to share which I would love to hear so please, fire away!

So, here are some creative ideas to keep your seed phrase safe and sound:

Use a funny phrase or a song to help you remember it. For instance, ""My dog ate my homework on a rainy day"" could remind you of the first part. 

Consider getting a tattoo of your seed phrase as a permanent reminder. Just make sure to find a reputable tattoo artist who won't mess up the accuracy, and maybe tweak a word or two so they can't steal it for themselves.

Embed your seed phrase in a piece of art by writing it in invisible ink and revealing it with a UV light. That's some James Bond-level stuff right there.

35,Euphoria is bad for investing,11vic0i,"We have had several green weeks lately. Returns are good, those who DCAed when everything was doom and gloom are now seeing great returns.

But beware of the euphoria. BTC to one million in three months is absurd and looks alot like the crazy talk we heard about BTC going to 100k by 2021. In the past, we have seen smart money using retail as exit liquidity in those periods.

Since we don't know where the market is going, a cautious approach is better. This means to keep DCAing like nothing changed, not going all in to allow us to take advantage of downs in the market, not leveraging our positions even if greed temps us to do so and not chasing gains by switching project everytime the market moves.

Investing is boring, if you are having fun you are most likely playing the casino. Don't do that to yourself, just accumulate for a better life.",Aseira,93,19,0.69
36,How I got into the crypto world through an almost scam!,11vrqeu,"First of all I would say sorry for the worse english, I used Google Translate from German to English for the following text, and I don’t know if I can use Anecdotal flair for this. So let’s go with my Text. 

An acquaintance gave me a Discord invitation for a server called ""Elite Pump Group"" and said that you could easily and quickly make a lot of money there. I joined the server and there were a few people chatting and several channels of pics from the past pumps. A guy named Mickey Gold then announces which coin and time as well as a link to an exchange site a few hours before the pump begins. I then observed a pair of these pumps and thought to myself, if that's true, after 4 to 5 such pumps you'll be rich!
That's when I started with respect and the rule: If it sounds too good to be true, it is and won't work. Since you as a beginner also hear that everything is possible with Crypto, I was about to do it. I personally wrote to this Mickey Gold because it meant investing at least 700-800 to ask why so much. He then said something about exchange fees and you can otherwise have problems with the exchange, but 100 to 150 should be worth it.
Since I'm generally skeptical about such things, I started my research. This is how I finally ended up in this community and thanks to you all I was able to expand my knowledge.
Long story short, in the end I noticed that 90 to 95% of the users in this Discord channel were bots, this exchange (luxumbit was the name) site where the alleged pumps were taking place had only been online for 2 months. Finally, I was then told to make a payout at the end you have to make a $400 verification deposit to get your money. At that point at the latest I knew FINGER AWAY and DON'T DEPOSIT MONEY.

Thanks to everyone for your tips and everything. You’re great Community",daigsischt,34,6,0.87
37,The Area Above The Bear: Why I Believe The Cycle Bottom Is In,11vw3v5,"**Intro:**

I haven't seen a technical approach like this one described on this sub before (or on YouTube; no Twitter account), so here goes. If it turns out this is common knowledge and even your grandmother is familiar with this analysis, then go ahead and downvote this post out of sight.

I wondered if the cycle bottom could be identified essentially in real time as it occurs by looking at the cumulative drawdown from the previous all-time high (I like to say PATH) over time, or the total amount of pain the market has felt on the way down.

In this way, a quite severe bear market that plummeted quickly and stayed really low for a relatively short time would inflict a similar amount of pain to a bear market that bled slowly and not so far down, but took forever to do it.

**Method with previous cycles:**

Knowing the tops and bottoms from the bear markets beginning in Nov. 2013 and Dec. 2017, respectively, I added up the percent loss from the PATH for each weekly close from top to bottom. This total has some funky unit like ""percent weeks"" or something like that, but the point is that it's a measure of the accumulated pain since the top.

For example, if the weekly close peaked for the 2013 bull run at $1,205.70 on Nov. 24, 2013, and the weekly close for Dec. 1, 2013 was $697, then for that week we would have (1205.70 - 697.00) / 1205.70 = 0.42, or 42%. For the weekly close that marked the cycle bottom (Jan. 11, 2015 at $199.60), we have (1205.70 - 199.60) / 1205.70 = 0.83, or 83%. The proportion or percent loss is always measured from the PATH, not the previous week. If you add up all those weeks from top to bottom, you get **33.3** (proportions expressed as decimals), or 3330%. That's the Area Above The Bear, the cumulative pain experienced from top to bottom.

[Area Above The Bear = Sum of the bars = 33.3](https://preview.redd.it/b1s47uyq3roa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b119e804a2326e21e27b72de1cc1ad5777b2672f)

For the bear market beginning after the 2017 blow-off, I have a peak weekly close of $19,345.50 on Dec. 10, 2017, and a weekly bottom of $3,228.70 on Dec. 9, 2018. The Area Above The Bear from top to bottom was **30.6**, or 3060 ""percent weeks"".

[Area Above The Bear = Sum of the bars = 30.6](https://preview.redd.it/a6cjk81t3roa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1570bff7751039a412e51712f509dba775d59500)

**This bear market:**

Now to the present bear market, where we don't really know for sure that the bottom has been printed (even if you think you know for sure, in which case I'll trust you, bro).

I have the weekly top at $64,398.60 on Nov. 7, 2021, and a low *so far* of $16,456.50 on Nov. 20, 2022. The Area Above The Bear for that period is **27.3**, or 2730 % weeks of pain.

[Area Above The Bear = Sum of the bars = 27.3](https://preview.redd.it/iv3wt7204roa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89c2e79ba3bdd7ede9bece7052071c1aa83a5c64)

So for the last three bear markets, assuming the bottom for the present one has printed, the Area Above The Bear has been \~ 33, 30, and 27. I think this number shrinking over time makes sense; just as the returns on the way up are diminishing over time, so should the losses on the way down.

|Bear market beginning|Area Above The Bear|Status|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nov. 2013|33.3|Confirmed, historical|
|Dec. 2017|30.6|Confirmed, historical|
|Nov. 2021|27.3|Unconfirmed, present|

As a gut-check, I assumed that the present bear market had not yet bottomed, and continued counting out to the end of February of this year. The Area Above The Bear from Nov. 20, 2022 to Feb. 26, 2023 is 36.8, larger than the known top-to-bottom areas from the prior two bear markets. **That makes it seem likely that the low for this cycle really was in November of 2022.**

**What about closes from other time scales?**

I did a similar analysis with **daily closes**, instead of weekly, and got a very similar answer. The daily Area Above The Bear was a number about 7 times larger than the weekly version for all three cycles. That makes sense, since there are 7 times as many bars.

|Bear Market Beginning|Area Above The Bear, Daily Closes|
|:-|:-|
|Dec. 4, 2013|217.6|
|Dec. 16, 2017|213.4|
|Nov. 8, 2021|193.6|

I'm lazy and haven't done the analysis with **monthly closes**. If someone wants to do that, then feel free. I suspect the numbers are about 1/4 the size as for the weekly analysis.

I think weekly closes are a nice time scale to use. Frankly, you don't need to know the bottom right down to the very day, and the certainty will be less anyway. If you expand out to a month, you could only find out several weeks after the fact that the bottom had hit. That's not the worst thing in the world, but decent-sized swings can occur in the space of two or three weeks.

**Uses and next time around:**

For the next bear market, which will inevitably begin in 2025 (trust me, bro), I expect that the Area Above The Bear will reach \~24 when the bottom is printed.

While this method won't predict when or where the bottom occurs, it will let you know *right after* the bottom has happened (if you trust it). That will allow you to buy in the next bear (or this one) with confidence that the price won't drop below the identified bottom.

I personally don't trust any technical method enough to abandon a DCA strategy for accumulation next time around (after the peak in 2025, trust me). However, I think I will hold a good chunk of powder on the side, and make a relatively large buy when the next Area Above The Bear reaches \~24.

\*\*\*My historical data may not be perfect, since it's hard to get weekly close data from 2013 for free. I got some of it from [investing.com](https://investing.com/), and when that web page froze, I switched to [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/). If you have higher quality data to work with, then feel free to quibble with my exact numbers and dates. Either way, I don't believe the outcome will change much, and the analysis can still be useful in the future.",MauveTyranosaur69,32,4,0.83
38,If it happens are you ready for a bank crisis?,11vpk8e,"Its getting dicey out there. There is a lot going on and a lot to unpack if things go sour. Bank runs are real and if one or two more banks fail we could start seeing a lack of faith in the financial system not seen in a long time.  So my question to this sub is if we are ready for the next financial crisis if it gets here in a week or a month? Are you comfortable that you and your loved ones have enough to survive if jobs are lost by the millions? Will your crypto, guns, food, land, generators and might be enough to get you by until something stabilizes. It just feels like things are going to break and it will be mostly us the little guys that will hurt. Have you saved enough? Do you have enough crypto? Do you believe crypto will be a viable alternative to get you by if your money is not available via your community bank? 

This is a big deal as small companies are already sweating this crisis. Many are deep in debt living of credit and loans plus the amount of debt they have vs unpaid bills, upcoming payroll and open account receivables not getting paid. And here lies one of the biggest problems for small businesses today. The amount of open account receivables not being paid is staggering across the board. Your employer better be on top of who owns them money and better start knocking on some doors because if not many of us will likely be out of a job. 

Remember. This is a game of trust, faith and confidence. Its all an illusion to make us believe this system works and for the most part it has but when it fails us it does so merciless and spares only the big whales. Us little guys absorb all the pain. So i'll ask again. Are you ready for the next bank crisis if indeed it does happen? WIll your crypto have any value or carry you anywhere during such stressful times? It might happen.

40,I think I know how CBDCs will be introduced in the US and possibly other countries,11vmpng,"The primary issue we're facing now is that banks don't have liquidity because many banks messed up big time. Most of the banks have bonds and securities that aren't liquid, i.e., cannot be cashed out without a big loss (exactly why SVB failed). Some have calculated this loss and it's a huge percentage, which is why we're seeing the ""$1M BTC in 90 days"" prediction. It's predicated on the idea that almost everyone is insolvent, and the fed has no choice but to hand them free money, which would cause hyper-inflation.

In the case of a bank-run, most of these banks will fall. In addition to that, the problem is that if you give these bank bail-out money (like we're hearing now), they'll spend it recklessly and repeat the cycle invest without proper risk-management to make yield, like they always did... well, why wouldn't they? They have all the free money they want every time they fail.

But if you think about it, I think a CBDC will be the Fed's go-to solution to this problem. 

People don't do bank-runs to stash the cash under their mattress, but they do it just to guarantee that their cash is available when they need it. Combining this with the fact that the liquidity crisis/bank-runs is a psychological thing, all people need to know is that their deposits are safe. How do you do that without giving the banks any money? You simply tell the bank to screw off, and you tell the people that they can have accounts with the federal reserve that will give them access to their deposits. The bank(s) goes bankrupt, but the people will feel happy, thinking that they didn't really lose their money, which they can immediately use through a central bank.

Now that we're in a banking crisis and Bitcoin is doing what is was made to do are you buying or are you waiting for the next drop? We have seen a lot of articles saying we would be at 1 million dollars in 90 days, but who actually believes that?

Till last year almost every mainstream media outlet had predicted that they would default on their $800m sovereign debt but that did not happen and now many other countries that are presently going through an economic crisis would be interested follow on their footpath. Do you then think that other countries would adopt Bitcoin? If yes, then which country would likely do it this year?

As for me, I think this small country Tonga islands might adopt Bitcoin. They have already shown interest in Bitcoin as they would like to mine it using the green energy which BTW, they have in abundance and another reason is that the population in Tonga is not that big for large energy consumption.

The validators give back about 85% of their block rewards to their delegators, meaning the required security for the network is around 15%\*42m = 6.3m XTZ, a 7 TIMES REDUCTION!

The idea is to emit the amount of rewards based on the amount staked in the network, hence the proposal called ""adaptive inflation"".

In that case, we would have been in a very strange situation: on one side you have the shitty failing banks, while on the other side a major stablecoin not able to stay stable at all (I know that the trigger was the failing of the bank, but still fear for the market does not put any reasoning in the game).

Something like that. Believe, conceive, achieve as Luke Rockhold would say. Then the next day on Saturday morning, prices started dropping LIKE A ROCK. See,during the late night/early morning, prices recovered to about $12.66, which was good. But Saturday was brutal. Shiz went from $12.66 all the way down to $11.78. I even got the Margin call email. But I had already gambled all my funds into one position so I had nothing left to put up for margin. But hope was still on the horizon as I wasn’t yet liquidated on any longs or even shorts, even though I still liquidated in my shorts.

My cheeks clapped around of applause at my stupidity the whole day into the night, especially as that night saw many mini-pumps and crashes that actually took the price even lower to $11.64, uncomfortably close to an all out liquidation. It was even harder to bear because I could have just sold at $12.96 or so but I was too greedy. Even when prices were still a ways above $12, I was still in a proper 50% loss. I remember seeing something like a 70% loss at some point, but I closed that screen so quick and told myself it wasn’t real. Did I mention the vast majority of my life savings was on this trade? The ~~hardest~~ most degenerate choices require the strongest wills.

Come to this morning prices were pretty poor still, still being mostly below $12 and me still close to liquidations. What was also playing on my mind was that there is even a liquidation fee, of maybe around 2%, so even if I was liquidated and left with 20%, I would then love 2%\* max leverage of that. But then my hope and belief paid off when suddenly some random degen, pushed the price all the way from seemingly just above $12 all the way to $12.94 baby! Man I, tapped out on that sell button so fast Conor McGregor would be proud. May have sprained a finger but I’ll bandage it with my dollar bill profits. I managed to make a 15% profit after all that. I even made a mistake selling around 10% of the position at 7% below the market price in the hype. All is definitely not well that ends well, I’m super tired and not at all satisfied with how things played out.

I won’t lie, I barely slept this weekend. The stress was wild and I lost several years off my lifespan but I actually made decent profit. Was it worth it? Would I do it again? Well…..",OneThatNoseOne,13,4,0.7
55,Awaiting the Third Wave of Cryptocurrency...,11vr747,"Is the Third Wave of Crypto about to dawn?

First Wave - Cryptocurrency is born

The First Wave of BTC was the formulation and development in 2009 but Satoshi and his bros. I don't know if any of you were there then but it seems this was the primordial realm where great gainz were common yet insights and technicality were needed. Just as with placer mining for gold the easy-to-find deposits were just there for the taking. As word of mouth and tech-forum geekery wound down with the rise of social media and mining bountiful Bitcoin become harder, this ended with the coming of the second era in about 2013. So 4 to 5 years have elapsed at this point.

The Second Wave of Bitcoin - Cryptography comes of age

The Second Wave of BTC is what we are still in I would argue. It started when mainstream news began to comment on it, from memory my first recollection was Russia Today's Kaiser Report. The bandwagon was on the move as the curious, the opportunistic and the crazy came along. Yet unlike with Gold Rushes of the past, there was no real mainstream adoption as the technology had not become easy to adopt for the masses. Obtaining a bitcoin required escrowing money and mining it was daunting for the uninitiated.

Slow to get going, but it begins to gather pace. The price is now on the rise and fall similar to a trade-cycle but arguably more erratic and chaotic. With this 'Exploration' comes the slow-hand of regulation yet also adoption in various guises. Honduras and Salvador lead the way. American Cryptocurrency Exchanges become dominant. This age will end I would argue sometime this year, possibly by fall. By now nearly everyone has heard of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, but only a small, growing segment of the population has some. Obstacles such as CEX collapses and scams hamper momentum, but not as critically as first feared.

Ten years have elapsed since 2013 and as mining is now only the realm of the specialized ASIC miner, trade and holding are entrenched. The next and possibly decisive age awaits...

The Third Wave of Bitcoin - Mass Adoption

Over the next 15 - 20 years this is highly likely to gather pace. Generation Zoomer, whilst with less disposable income than Gen. Boomer and perhaps Gen. X, will be the final booster to the Crypto Rocket. Web3 and crypto storage may come into full fruition as a utility but possible difficulties include hyper-inflation and near-prohibition.

The real token will go live in 4 days.,11vmxta,Recently there have been a lot of hype regarding the arbitrum airdrop(which I just barely missed sadly) and this is just a friendly advice to remind you not to buy any IOU ARB tokens(You can currently buy them on xt.com and hotbit. Currently ARB's fully diluted market cap would be 123 billion dollars which would make it the third largest crypto currency if all the supply would get released in 4 days. Idk the exact percentage that will be released but if I had to guess it would be roughly 10% of the 10 billion tokens. Even with that it's marketcap would be 12 billion dollars and if we were to compare it with optimism it is way too overpriced and would be one of the tokens in the top 10.

58,"""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks""",11vutwh,"Sounds familiar? If you don't know, this is a message written by Nakamoto himself on the Genesis block of bitcoin, engraved in blockchain 'till the end of time (https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-genesis-block-bitcoin-terms/). Of course, it refers to the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath of a series of bank bailouts that followed.

As the age old saying goes, history doesn't necessarily repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. As of today, UBS has offered to buy Credit Suisse for approximately two billions dollars (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ubs-reportedly-reaches-deal-to-buy-credit-suisse-for-more-than-2-billion-8c9bd4d5). Had this deal not have gone through, the bank would have likely been nationalized. As you know, this is not the only problematic bank in this crisis, since multiple smaller banks have also been royally fucked this time - especially including SVB, the most relevant one for crypto.

People have always suffered, and will continue suffering, from the ""This time is different""-syndrome. Especially in financial crises, when times are good for a long enough time, people manage to forget what has happened before, and believe we have learnt from past mistakes. Thus, they shouldn't be repeated, except that they of course always are (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6372440-this-time-is-different). This is what partly constitutes into crises like these. 

The relevance of all of this for crypto is of course manifest: the original idea, or one of them of Bitcoin was to be your own bank. Even though this poses problems and by no means is a straightforward change, crypto must keep challenging the traditional practices and schemes. This revolution, if you will, is to make the game more fair for the common man, and we must HODL strong in times like these. This time is not different, and without true changes, it will be repeated.",Randomplayeri,24,3,0.6
59,Keeping your crypto secure is nobody's job but yours. Here's how to do it.,11vdyok,"I've seen a few posts recently about people either losing their seed phrase, or an unauthorized user gaining access to their seed phrase. Here is my method for keeping my seed phrase secure:

First, you need a Ledger. If you're not keeping self-custody of your coins, you're missing the point of crypto. Crypto was born out of the distrust of banking and traditional financial systems after the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bailout. If you're letting a bank or exchange have custody of your crypto, you're giving away all of the unique properties of crypto that give it so much potential and value. Get a Ledger.

Next, your ledger will have a 24-word seed phrase. Obviously, this phrase should never be entered into any digital device, period. It should be written down on paper, in pencil (ink from a pen will run if it gets wet).

BUT, what if someone breaks into your house and steals the piece of paper with your seed phrase written on it? What if your house burns down? These concerns (and others) are why you *don't write your entire seed phrase on one piece of paper. You write parts of your seed phrase on three separate pieces of paper.* Here's what you do:

* Paper slip #1 = words 1-16
* Paper slip #2 = words 9-24
* Paper slip #3 = words 1-8 and 17-24

Now, the complete seed phrase is readable with *any two* of these pieces. So for example, if paper #1 burns up in a fire, you can recreate it with the data written on papers #2 and #3. If paper #3 is stolen, the thief only has 16 of your 24 words. They will not be able to gain access to your wallet with only 16 words.

You might ask, ""what if all three pieces are stolen, or burn up in a fire?"" *That's why you keep all three pieces in different locations.* I keep my Paper #1 stored safely on my property. Papers #2 and #3 I've given to two different people whom I trust with my life. They keep the paper I gave to each of them in their own secure locations.

If one of the papers is ever lost or destroyed, I can simply rebuild it using the other two papers. The two people I gave the papers to also know who has the other paper, so even if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, they could get together and recover my crypto, and figure out what to do with it. It wouldn't be lost forever just because I've been smooshed by a bus.

True, the other two people could conspire against me and recreate my seed phrase using the papers I gave them and steal my crypto. *That's why you need to give them to people that you TRUST.* Not only trust in terms that you don't think they would rip you off, but also trustworthy in the sense that you trust them to store your paper responsibly and not lose it.

Before I started investing in crypto, I researched all this stuff. To me, crypto was never going to ""go mainstream"" if a flood, theft, or fire could wipe out someone's entire holdings. I wasn't interested in crypto unless I could solve the problem of redundant and secure self-custody. To me, this ""three-paper strategy"" solves the issue of secure self-custody reliably enough that I'm confident that my crypto is as safe as the fiat in my bank (maybe moreso).

Don't lose your hard-earned money because of lazy security practices. Crypto is for the big kids. There's nobody babysitting your crypto and making sure bad people don't take it. There's nobody keeping track of it to make sure you don't lose it. You need to take responsibility for your own crypto, and the three-paper strategy is a great way to achieve that.",neocamel,76,20,0.68

61,Ethereum with two spots in top 10,11vkqif,"Ethereum made history by becoming the first cryptocurrency to occupy two spots in the top 10 cryptocurrencies with the highest market cap.

 Lido Staked ETH (stETH) has surpassed Binance USD (BUSD) in market cap, now valued at over $10 billion, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, BUSD dropped to ninth place with just $8.4 billion in circulation. Lido allows Ethereum holders to stake their ETH in exchange for stETH, a separate derivative token that can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, borrowed, or used as collateral for loans on DeFi protocols. There is currently just 5.6 million ETH ($9.9 billion) staking on the Lido protocol (excluding interest), according to Nansen, a 150% increase from around 2.3 million ETH. ($4.1 billion) a year ago. 

More than 171,000 wallet addresses have stETH. ETH derivatives such as stETH have exploded in popularity in recent months, taking full advantage of the long staking periods associated with participating in the Ethereum 2.0 consensus. Over 17.6 million ETH ($31.3 billion) was staked, representing nearly 15% of the outstanding supply. 

Meanwhile, Ethereum's dominance — which measures how much of the crypto market is ETH — hovers just under 20%, while bitcoin's dominance is nearly 46%.

However,  despite this recent adoption of MOONS (e.g. in DeFi Arbitrum Nova),  surge in price and increase in marketcap we are still somewhere in the  #3000+ in crypto market cap ranking [\[1\]](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moon/).  Obviously MOONS  mkt cap is smaller than the market cap of large  cryptos such as BTC and ETH, and I do not see MOONS approaching such mkt  cap values. But compared to other projects, MOONS has significant room  to go up. Especially since meme coins like SHIB and DOGE still have  massive market caps (6.5B & 10B respectively) and shady coins like  LUNC (0.8B) & hacked coins like ONE (0.28B) still hold market caps  10 to 20 times the size of MOONS.

Also  with the recent move of Reddit into the NFT market with its avatars, it  seems Reddit is betting on crypto and potentially will develop further  in this direction. Similarly, we saw GameStop enter the crypto/NFT  market in partnership with Immutable, of which the coins (IMX 1.3B &  LRC 0.47B)  also currently hold a significantly larger mkt cap compared  to MOONS. So if the MOONS ecosystem keeps developing and finds its way  to more applications (e.g. Reddits potential own NFT marketplace), I see  enough room for a further price increase.

66,"[SERIOUS] When will we no longer say ""we are still early""?",11vx2rs,"One of our most common sayings on the sub is ""we are still early"", but when will we actually not be early anymore? Crypto started in 2009, so we are 14 years in, id agree that's still early. So what are the benchmarks that will determine we have become established and no longer early. A short list of where we stand:

\-Currently there are almost 23,000 different crypto's

\-56 different countries have favorable regulations of crypto

\-2 countries have adopted it as legal tender

\-Crypto has become integrated into platforms and technology

\-There are real world uses for blockchain and NFT's

\-Over 1 trillion market cap

&#x200B;

The two key factors we need are awareness and behavioral intent. I believe most people are aware of crypto unless living off grid. So that means we need behavioral intent, which is a willingness to adapt to technology. Some great examples are the internet and smart phones. The internet came around in 1990's and was not well accepted, But by the 2000's it was everything and everywhere. The same can be said for the smart phone. iPhone 1st came out in 2007, and by 2011 everyone had to have a smart phone. Adoption can definitely be quick or painfully slow.

&#x200B;

Now to the question. When will we no longer be considered early? 

\-Regulations established globally that establish trust in crypto?

\-Every country establishes its own stable coin to replace fiat?

\-We have portable crypto wallets that we can instantly transfer between and make purchases with?

So I'm hoping to get some insight and perhaps even expert guidance from the sub.

Let's say I have a Metamask account, and within that account I have two wallets. One is a normal wallet, while the other wallet is one that's secured by a Ledger. 

For the first wallet, I use it actively to interact with DeFi contracts. I can't keep track on where it's been (and its been to weird places). The second rarely if ever interacts with any contract - its also the one holding a lions share of my NFT assets.

My questions are: 

1. If I signed a malicious contract with the first wallet and it has a command that allows it unrestricted access to that wallet, can it also see and access my other, Ledger secured wallet?

2. How secure is the other wallet secured by my Ledger? So far I've only used it to receive NFTs and signed interactions with OS and Blur (which I've since revoked via revoke.cash) 

3. As far as I can remember, the second wallet is an imported one from my Ledger device (it says Ledger in the list when I click the circle icon top right of MM) so the seed phrase should still be in the Ledger but... any other way  can be sure it's a Ledger account and not a MM wallet ported into the Ledger instead?

Sorry for the long winded questions. I need to make very sure because of all the stories of funds being taken even when the wallet was secured by a Ledger.

After some months the gov resolution came and all the remaining depositors losted 50% or more of their deposits 

After this event, people losted confidence in our banks, they started saving money in their houses with USD cash, sending money to other countries banks, buying property, anything you can think of instead of leaving the money inside our banks. BUT, some small % always remained in local banks because all of us needs to pay expenses, buy groceries, movie tickets, taxes, etc... and credit/debit cards are still very usefull. What we understood is that even big institutions can fail and that the government will help us till certain point, that we need to take precautions by our own hands and diversify elsewhere.

72,Another clarification about Balaji's $1mn bet,11vgtmu,"I made a post earlier today titled ""Clarification about Balaji's $1mn bet (misinformation)"" where I was making a point that his $1mn bet was against hyperinflation of dollar and not $1mn btc price in 90 days; all of this based on all his visible tweets which I had linked to. Even though many others on the sub said otherwise, I thought so since no one around spoke of what and where he said until u/angry_koala_26 quoted his $1mn bet terms. 

It so happens that he linked one of his tweets to a longer post which is as follows:

Here are the remaining references, as Twitter has a limit on the number of links in one post.

I am moving $2M into USDC for the bet. I will do it with Medlock and one other person, sufficient to prove the point. See my next tweet. Everyone else should just go buy Bitcoin, as it'll be much cheaper for you than locking one up for 90 days.

Terms of the bet: ideally someone can set up a smart contract where BTC is worth >$1M in 90 days, then I win. If it's worth less than $1M in 90 days, then the counterparty gets the $1M in USD.

HYPERBITCOINIZATION We have to define hyperinflation in BTC vs USD terms because all other fiat currencies can and will be inflated away. That is hyperbitcoinization.

This is the moment that the world redenominates on Bitcoin as digital gold, returning to a model much like before the 20th century. What's going to happen is that individuals, then firms, then large funds will buy Bitcoin. Then sovereigns like El Salvador (@nayibbukele) and tiny crypto friendly countries.

The big move will be when a US state like Florida or Texas, or a ""normal"" country like Estonia, Singapore, Saudi, Hungary, or UAE buys BItcoin. And when @narendramodi tells India's central bank to buy Bitcoin, even as a hedge, it's over.

Why will it be so fast? Well, hyperinflation happens fast. We've seen digital pandemics (COVID), digital riots (BLM), and digital bank runs (SVB). Everything will happen very fast once people check what I'm saying and see that the Federal Reserve has lied about how much money there is in the banks. All dollar holders get destroyed.

The thing is, people are still tuned to an analog world where things get gradually worse rather than all at once. But there isn't much forewarning for a digital event — it's 1 and then it's 0. Just like the bank runs, except this is the central bank.

There are however two sources of forewarning. First is the chart of the long-term depreciation of USD vs BTC, from less than $1 USD per BTC to $25k USD per BTC. Much of the smart money has been voting against the dollar since the financial crisis. The end is a digital drop off a cliff, almost invisible on the chart — but highly visible in the world.

This tweet is the second forewarning. It'll be ignored and mocked by people who still trust the US establishment, even after the last few years. Who can't imagine that the US banks and media could be lying to them to this extent.

But they are. Just as they did in 2008, and over the last ten years. The digital devaluation of the dollar is coming and it's going to be intense.

#ends here, a few of my thoughts hereafter


As much as I have no clue about what btc's monetary valuation would be against usd due to events we've never seen before, I tend to think that his reasoning and references citing them hold valid. I'm surely rooting for the outlook of the current financial and political systems he has as I think of it similarly.

One aspect I tend to differ a bit about is the source of dollar's devaluation. I'm not sure if I differ exactly, since I'm not sure of what he thinks of this issue. It's about the nature of bubbles in general across decades/generations. If we look at the history of bubbles, the only common thing that sparks them is when drastic growth picks up in both the economy and one or more other aspects that tend to dominate most personal and social behavior.

The two most commonly know bubbles from the recent times are the dot com bubble and the housing bubble, both in the US. I don't think many people around the world know or atleast talk about Japan's real estate and stock market bubble of the 1980s. The general opinion both in media and general public is that Japan has a fairly sound monetary system. No one talks about or reacts as much to rate cuts or hike happening there even though it's the world's third largest economy, accounting for almost 8.6% of global GDP. All the messes we know of are from the US which is effectively spreading waves across the world via whatever happens with the dollar like we felt in the global recession. Just the housing bubble there due to a banking and valuation fraud sent the dollar spinning in the air and all nations feeling the effects since they use it as a reserve currency and partially where the own currency derives value from. And as a result, if all of them inflate against each other even in small proportions over long periods of time (decades), we can clearly sense something might go wrong with the notion of money if the US screws up somewhere. Especially in how it's been managing its $.

With the two recent banking collapses in the US, we saw how the government panicked and announced that they effectively fully insure all deposits. But only for these two banks though. It's beyond the mandate of FDIC and the secretary Jannet Yellen stepped in because she sensed ""systemic risk"" to the financial infrastructure of the economy. Econ words for ""oh shit, stop that else the banking sector is gonna trip and fall."" There's a reason they're scared. It's because everything been lent in multiples both to the world (both corporations and foreign governments) and itself. And all that the banks are supposed to keep as reserve are with the FED where they get exchanged for treasuries where the government effectively take that for a fixed period and use it for whatever they wish. One of the things it does with that is lend and fund the functioning of multilateral institutions like the IMF. It pretty much gets that to perform its duty as a government where it's also been using that to exercise power over the world and one of its biggest forms is the military spending. Pretty much what the general international consensus is for what backs the strength of dollar - that it can control and surf through the world events. No wonder they've been involved with every major war of the last century. Anyways, I'm rambling all of this to make the point of credit bubble. That a lot more is being spent that what can be afforded for whatever real value there is to back it - the real economy (!monetary economy). What those US economists won't be allowed to call a disequilibrium.

Everyone would know from econ 101 that wherever there's disequilibrium, the side that's inflated has to revert. It's scary to say it but it literally translates to 'the dollar has to crash to represent what the real American economy can actually afford.' There are many Americans on our sub, it'd be interesting to hear if you can bare the cost of every other diplomatic engagement around the world - military, financial (debt) and health are those big chunks. If the citizens can't, the government's gotta be crazy. It pulls out funds for this both from taxes and as well as fed backdoor. The whole world also takes their word for granted for if they're accounting everything right and not in alignment with their incentives. What could go wrong I guess lol?

If the banks start losing value of the stock market like they already have, people will slowly but surely start pulling out. Would you keep your money in if the bank is losing over 10% its market value in a week? Or even a month? Forget it, even a quarter? It guess that's where time is to tell what's to unfold.

Also wanted to stand corrected over the terms of bet where he's literally betting a lot to go down in the next 90 days including btc @$1mn. Interesting bet for sure despite being degen at best for just making a point🤷‍♂️",noob_zarathustra,68,4,0.57
73,The Bull Trap: How to Spot It and Protect Your Crypto Portfolio 🐂🔥,11vks5h,"Hey guys, it's an exciting time in the crypto market right now with prices soaring to new all-time highs. However, it's important to be aware of the possibility of a bull trap.

A bull trap is when the market appears to be in a strong uptrend, but then suddenly reverses course and begins to decline. This can be devastating for those who were caught off guard and invested heavily during the bull run.

Here are some tips for spotting a bull trap and protecting your crypto portfolio:

1. Don't chase FOMO: When prices are skyrocketing, it's easy to get caught up in the hype and start investing heavily. However, this can be a trap. Instead, focus on the long-term fundamentals of the project and make sure you're investing based on sound principles.
2. Look for signs of a top: Watch for signs that the market may be reaching a top. This could include extreme price volatility, overbought indicators, or a sudden influx of new investors.
3. Take profits: If you've already made significant gains during the bull run, consider taking some profits off the table. This will protect your portfolio in case of a sudden downturn.
4. Diversify: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different projects and asset classes. This will help to minimize your risk and protect your portfolio in case one project performs poorly.
5. Have a plan: Make sure you have a solid investment plan in place and stick to it. Don't make hasty decisions based on emotion or hype.

Remember, the crypto market is inherently volatile and unpredictable. Yesterday people were pumping the price running back from stablecoins into crypto along with Binance and tomorrow FED might sneeze and we'll be retesting another all time lows. Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered.",ETHBTCVET,52,4,0.56
74,Fire/water and weather resistant ways to keep your seed phrase safe and secure.,11vk29u,"I’ve seen lots of recommendations since being on this thread of how to safely keep your seed phrase, that holds our precious assets safe and accessible at all times.

 I think the best way I can think of is to get a cheap metal engraver from Harbor Frieght, and take small credit card sized pieces of metal you can cut out from a sheet/piece that you can get at a hardware store. Use the engraver and put your seed phrase on multiple metal cards and keep them in multiple safe locations. 

Also wet concrete indoors in an unnoticeable location if you’re pouring a fresh slab in your garage or basement. Find a location on an end that no one would ever think to look, and while the concrete is still not cured, and in between dry and wet and write it in with a fine point object. If it ever flooded or had a fire, in theory you should still be able to access it. And if you ever moved, just take a grinder took with a sandpaper disc and carefully remove the seed phrase from the concrete so the next owner can’t see it.

If you live in an apartment or a city, the metal engraving would probably be the safest bet. It doesn’t really stink or anything when etching metal like it’d be for wood.

Hope this helps, stay safe!

75,Do we need altcoins?,11vi6jk,"If you look into altcoins like SOL, DOT, ADA, ATOM, etc. all of them sound good. In fact all of them sound promising enough for many people to think they will thrive in the future.

ETH is upgradeable so it can change with the market, while BTC has the potential to be solid and strong. So I read some stuff about these coins but I can't see a reason why we would really need them? They have their upsides like scalability and interoperability. But while ETH is evolving what do they offer to replace ETH and/or BTC one day?

Before we begin, this is my opinion, thank you for reading, and I’d love to see your opinion. Well let’s begin!

#START

A few weeks ago, busd was in some poopoo and since it’s a stablecoin, the price stays the same. So whether the marketcap is 1 billion or 100 billion, it’s the same/near price. 

Basically around 3-5 billion dollars worth of busd was taken out, and there’s a good chance most people panic sold it and just dumped it into BTC. And went back to sleep, thus the spike in BTC while the busd drama was happening. 

#MIDDLE

Exact thing happened to USDC, it lost a mc of 7.5 billion dollars, (I switched to usd recently, so this number might be a little off). 

Where would that money go to? BTC, and then fomo kicks in, and it goes up. That’s why in 2 days it went up 15-20%.

Tldr: crypto and the bear market are the gateway for financial education, or at least financial curiosity, for the new generation. 

I will speak for my own personal experience but I think some, if not most, will agree. Especially my generation.

I'm 30 years old and I have a decent job. But I NEVER cared or even bothered to improve my financial literacy.

How does the FED work? At what rate are they printing money? What are bonds? How big is public debt? How does inflation work? What's the current rate of inflation? What financial products does the government and banks provide? What's the risk? Etc etc..

Big mistake. Everyone and I mean everyone should know what's going on with monetary policy. It's the policy that most directly impacts your life.

I'm portuguese. And at least in my country they teach 0 about economy and how money works. Let me say that again, they teach 0.

If you never bother to do your own research and get some financial education you will become an adult with no idea how money really works and who controls it.

Now enters crypto. I get skin in the game. While the bull goes on me no care no much.

But a big bear comes along and ""wtf is happening with the world? Why is inflation so high, how much did they print, why are banks collapsing, what does that mean for my crypto and my job/salary?""

I learn about risk. About rate of inflation. About burning. About securities. About reserves. About bonds. About yield. Etc etc..

You don't only calculate ATH base on the last price but rather the marketcap. One example, a coin that went over hyper inflation during the last bull

market cap: 2.8B

GRT now: 0.16$

Some coins have 2.5% other 10% or even 100%, if you compare only the price you are in for a bad time when you realize that that **easy x20 is just a x3**.

The ignition might have been people panic-selling USDC for BTC and ETH, but the growth has been sustained after that.  
I am however worried for the mid-term future:  
\- inflation is still high (both in the US and in the EU) and has kept eaten away at people's purchasing power and savings (I'm talking 10% to 100% increases in the price of all goods, from food to furniture - where I live milk is 30% more expensive than last October, meat is 20% more expensive than 1 year ago, some kinds of home furniture are **60%** more expensive and so on)  
\- despite the above, the rate hikes will seemingly continue for the foreseeable future despite there being no excessive spending to stop; JPow has gleefully commented on how the job market is still ""very tight"", meaning more or less ""we can hike the rates some more, we can afford to have more unemployed people around""  
\- salaries for a lot of professions are NOT keeping up with inflation, and since there already is no overspend to correct with rate hikes I would expect to see even less spending in the future, with people retreating into just spending the bare minimum  
\- the tech sector, which crypto is fairly strongly tied to, has been experiencing regular layoffs since circa the start of the year and it doesn't look like it's stopping anytime soon

In fact, no one can say for certain what the future holds. However, it's reasonable to expect that the Bullrun will eventually arrive and lead us to new heights. We should keep a watchful eye on market trends and stay informed to make the best investment decisions.

With that being said I wonder and want to ask you: 

 What specific mistakes did you make during the previous crypto Bullrun that led to losses or reduced profits, and how do you plan to modify your investment strategy to increase profits and minimize risks during the upcoming Bullrun?

 Have you identified the areas where you went wrong, and have you learned from your past mistakes? 

What you will do differently this time and what is one thing you will never do again?",UnkownMillionare,150,18,0.72
94,Should We Be Worried About Bitcoin﻿ Ossification?,11v9o7j,"Now I may know a couple big fancy words, but I'm not going to lie, I had to go look up what the heck ""ossification"" means.  The fundamental question is: are we reaching a point where there are so many stakeholders and interdependencies to account for when proposing changes to the bitcoin protocol that there's a risk that progress will be stunted, leaving btc to be susceptible to competition from newer and more nimble options.",AJoyfulProcess,24,7,0.73
95,You Guys still want to be paid in crypto ?,11v25e6,"
Hy Party people, 
during the last Bull run there were some posts about how cool it would be, if you could be paid in crypto for your jobs.
Some people suggested they would like to be paid 100 % in crypto or maybe atleast 50 / 50 .
Than came the bear.
So im wondering, would you still like to get your payment in form of a crypto currency ?
And has anybody of you already got an offer of this kind?
Im talking about ""clasical jobs"". Not some internetjobs like build my Website or help me with some project,...

Just curious about this subs opinion on that.",skillbaron,106,15,0.71
96,Now that we are on the upswing I calculated how much a coin would be worth with a 1K investment if it ever reaches back to its all time high.,11uvax1,"Updating this now that we are on an up swing again. The game here is if you believe that a certain project would ever reach is All Time High ( ATH ) again, how much would an 1K investment be if it every did. 

One caveat here is ALGO since the ATH is a bit nebulous due to a spike price about 3 years ago so depending on who you ask the ATH was more recent than that.

98,Possible to get verified on an exchange while a digital nomad?,11vkvrd,"Sorry if this is a dumb question but I've spent half a day in frustration and reddit usually delivers. 

I've never used an exchange or owned crypto but I'd like to start. I'm a US citizen currently in (the republic of) Georgia. I saw that Binance is allowed in Georgia so I made an account and started going through the verification process. It asks you to upload documents to verify your ID and place of residence. However my *US* documents obviously don't match my current place of resident (Georgia) which would be a problem. Additionally customer service then let me know that they don't support US citizens anyways. 

So, before I keep banging my head on a wall trying the same thing with other exchanges, can someone confirm that it is in fact possible to get verified on an exchange while residing in a country where you are not a citizen? Is there a particular exchange that would be best suited for this situation?",patricktherat,26,1,0.67

I have already set up the moon vault via my smartphone so have the whole seed phrase set up etc, but I do nearly all my work online from my PC, work from home etc, don't use the phone much if at all.

So my question is, am I only going to accrue moons if it's on the PC interface?

100,Created my own Indicator Set as a means for discipline,11vg38r,"In short:

Due to my lack of discipline and my gambling behavior, I am trying to create my own technical indicators to teach myself to not FOMO but to wait for the right signals. I am quite proud of the outcome and I want to share my positive feeling about it as well as the script itself.

I know it is not perfect and I still tend to overtrade.. but I try to see it as part of the learning curve to understand what strategy works best. And the need to have PATIENCE!

I am now working on a stragety script based on the ""TIRF"" to combine these signals in a meaningful way.

It turned into quite a joyfull hobby, experimenting with pine script. It is much easier then I first thought. I started after watching some interesting guides on youtube how they used ChatGPT to create ""insanly profitable"" strategies, which after backtesting myself is hughly overexagerated... But regardless I tried it myself. And to be honest ChatGPT really sucks in scripting consistently, I only use it as an assistent and actually write most on my own now.

I hope this script may be helpful to others as well. I am always interested to get some feedback on how to improve it. I try to explain the main aspects in the TradingView post as well as comments inside the script.

&#x200B;

Enjoy and have a great run in the future!

In fact, Nov 15th 2021 was the last day the sentiment scored higher that this (72). Not coincidentally, back then BTC was trading near its all-time high. This was at a price of $67,566.83 on Nov 8th 2021. 

Although it should be said that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index does not constitute investment advice, financial advice or trading advice, the index is seen as a well-known indicator of market movement.

Another tool often used as an indicator for overall sentiment and trends is the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart. 

The chart was developed as a meme, and has had a recent version upgrade to better ‘fit’ the charts. Nevertheless, also here we can see bullish signals. 

For the first time since Sept 12th 2022 the chart has climbed out of the ‘BUY’ and ‘Basically a Fire Sale’ categories. We have now entered the ‘Accumulate’ territories. To those fighting the FOMO, at this point in time the Rainbow chart indicates the maximum price of BTC in the ‘HODL’ phase at $62,350.58. This would need a 126% price surge, before we would enter the phase named ‘Is this a bubble?’

Nobody knows whether we are in the mids of a bull trap or whether we are at the start of a bull run. But one thing that is for sure, these signs can be seen as bullish AF.

102,"While the banks were imploding, Retail bought Crypto at the highest pace since the FTX collapse. Bitcoin is truly working as Satoshi intended.",11u2ws8,"Truly one of the highlights of just not this week but probably of the whole Crypto history (at least according to me) was this week when Bitcoin started to pump like 30% in three day while the whole banking sector was imploding and there was fear all around.

This just showed that Bitcoin can indeed work as Satoshi Nakamoto wanted it to, a trust-less alternative against banks. We can also strengthen this view as we look on some on-chain data and especially focus on the very people affected by the bank implosions, the retail like us all.

Showing how the people that were the most affected by the fear around banks were actually taking Crypto as an alternative, obviously not all of them but we can expect that to be a considerable part of them.

104,Have you had any awkward interactions with people when crypto has been brought up?,11v2jn4,"I was out with my work colleagues last Friday and one of the older guys brought up investments in the traditional markets. I quickly brought up crypto, and straight away his body language changed - I could tell right then where this was going…

I explained the usual pro-crypto stance and then he absolutely went on one. “Crypto is too volatile” “the bubble will burst” “it’s speculative” bla bla bla. He was saying this in a passive aggressive tone and I’m not one to argue or debate so just shrugged my shoulders and said “we’ll see, won’t we”.

Now suddenly, every new project at work this guy is being really off with me (I’ve worked with him on a few projects before and he’s been great). Not sure if it’s personal or just a deep hatred for the space, I don’t care to be honest.

106,"From being a doubter, I am starting to believe more and more that the anti-crypto bank-related theories have real merit",11usj77,"The FDIC decided to close Signature Bank because they represent “extraordinary risk”. Signature representatives claim that the FDIC shuttered their door due to a anti-crypto stance. What is at least somewhat interesting is, Barney Frank who sat on their board, is an ex-Congressman, and was one of the two men responsible for overhauling the US banking system post-2008. Frank asserts that regulators targeted the bank to send an “anti-crypto message.” He also spoke about his further post-2008 proposals, as part of the Frank-Dodd act it is inferred, that would have protected more depositors and prevented this situation we find ourselves in today once again, but these proposals did not pass in Congress. The irony is that the exact measures that the Fed, Treasury and FDIC have taken today are exactly what he proposed over a decade ago. I’d think this is the guy to know something about something.

Flash-forward to today, the CEO of JP Morgan had requested a meeting with Fed Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. This meeting occurred where they “brainstormed ideas”, with some input from the FDIC head as well. Can you imagine the heads of the FDIC, Treasury and Federal Reserve responding to a request for and hopping on a call to “brainstorm ideas” with anyone in crypto?  

Now I understand this is a bit unfair. The fiat banking system is indeed critical to the economy, but it understates either enormous power and influence, or some perverse incentive for  regulators. 

What does dig at me though, is the dozens of articles I’ve had to dig through to find that fact reports that JP Morgan, the Fed, Treasury and FDIC did have effectively a closed door meeting, that was all requested by JP Morgan. It just *stinks.*

Now out of their “brainstorming”, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are each depositing $5 billion in First Republic, the banks[ announced in a statement](https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/press-release/2023/bank-of-america-citigroup-jpmorgan-chase-wells-fargo-goldman-sachs-morgan-stanley-bny-mellon-pnc-bank-state-street-truist-and-u-s-bank-to-make-uninsured-deposits-totaling-30-billion-into-first-republic-bank). Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are depositing $2.5 billion each for a total of 30B or so. These deposits are *supposedly* to be treated like regular deposits, but we know that is 99.9% probably not true. Big banks are going to ensure priority on thor deposits.

Then there was the *initial* framing of bank failure as crypto’s fault, until they backpedalled when the public who seem still enraged from 2008, just weren’t buying it. Also, the near-collapse of First Republic and the cracking pressure on other non-crypto-friendly banks was just making it clear that wasn’t true. Besides that, buys in the crypto market are making it clear that media would probably just end up alienating their audience.

And then there’s the fact that the bailed out First Republic was said to be in a very similar situation like Signature Bank if not worse, but Signature was closed and First Republic was rescued. Interesting choice. Of course, there are the allegations that Signature asked Signature to stop crypto activity but frankly that is a fairly weak substantiation.

Now, we are seeing banks borrow record highs of 164B from Fed backstop facilities, which do actually come at some cost, which implies that there are actually a lot of stressed banks, probably somewhere close to the position of where Signature and First Republic were. *Maybe,*  it is just a *coincidence* that Signature was the one that happened to fail first and also happened to be a crypto-friendy bank, even though if it were only given just just one more working day  until Monday thereabout, with all the facilities by the FDIC, Treasury and Fed to sure up banks they would have almost absolutely pulled through. This is assuming they would have even failed without forced closure at all.

And I don’t think I even need to *start* on anything the SEC has done. Meanwhile banks get away with slaps on the wrist from the SEC after their several violations and frauds a year quota, still usually at a profit from the fraud or violation’s returns after losses from the fine.

Regulators aside, U.S. legislators demanded details on American banks’ connections to cryptocurrency in a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell back in December. Democratic senators Tina Smith of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts both specifically mentioned Signature Bank and Silvergate..in their warning about the connections between traditional banks and cryptocurrency. Ironically, it was the same Elizabeth Warren who to repeal 2018 rollback of critical Dodd-Frank protections from 2018. In yet *another* twist of irony, Warren again wrote a letter to seek answers for the Signature Bank collapse, which in reality, was a forced closure rather than a collapse but again the fact that it was a closure rather than a collapse is a key detail being omitted by the majority of news outlets.

On the point of news outlets, I also recently made a [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11tv3l4/moneyand_government_power_talks_forbes_has/)about a very “pro-crypto” and/or pro-decentralization article by Forbes, that also held government at fault for the current banking collapse, and how the Forbes magically backpedalled days later, and change the article to something that remove the blame on government and regulators.

At this point, you’d have to be illogical to at least dismiss the possibility of serious foul play, if not outright manipulation and abuse of power.

108,Some stats about round 37,11uph6x,"Hello all, 

recently I became a little bit obsessed with numbers, so I would like to share some basic stats about the distribution round 37. Of course, we will focus on Karma. 

The core of the discussion will be the following chart, which is a distribution of how many karma points were gained by how many users (On the horizontal axis the karma bins, while on the vertical axis the count of each bin):

[Karma histogram - Round 37](https://preview.redd.it/dl3ywpxj5ioa1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a093b550c8339196e052522def55bb274fdcafc2)

For reference, the total amount of users who were taken into account are 11601. As you can see the vast majority has gained much less than 100 Karma points. 

To make this even clearer, I will report the main quartiles and the mean (I'll also put some additional info in brackets, for those of you who are not familiar with quartiles):

\- 1st Quartile: 4 (25% of eligible users gathered 4 or less karma points)

\- 2nd Quartile (Median): 14 (50% of eligible users gathered 14 or less karma points)

\- 3rd Quartile: 53 (75% of eligible users gathered 53 or less karma points)

\- Mean (or average): 116,8

I want to close with a last piece of info, which is what happens if we consider the top 1% karma points earners:

\- 99 percentile: 1848 (meaning that 99% of users gained less than 1848 karma points)

\- Number of users in top1%: 116

111,Your Hardware Wallet CAN be drained- even IF you keep your seed phrase secure! Are you safe? Please learn how to Revoke Allowances!,11u9jf4,"I see more and more people here reporting that they have been hacked, so I figured I'd write this post.  **TL:DR** is on the bottom for those impatient crypto souls :)  If even one person is saved, my late night rambling is worth it. I'm not a pro by ANY means, but I've been around the block long enough to know a thing or two, and lost a few dollars here and there ;)  The goal of this post is to be as straight forward as possible, like if I was explaining this to a 5 year old. If you're experienced, you may find it a little boring.

Most new investors dabble in shitcoins available on DEX's while looking for those 1000x gains. They dig through telegram and discord channels looking for the next ETH. Not only are they new, and inexperienced, but now they're digging in the deep end of the pool. This is where the risk lies. The scammers love the deep end of the crypto pool...

Most **crypto investors think that by having a hardware wallet and keeping their crypto on one, they are immune to being hacked and robbed.** If you are one of those people (like I was in 2018), **you are wrong**. The old school wrench attack is not your worry here. **Not revoking allowances is...**

For starters, did you ever interact with ANY smart contract using your hardware wallet? If so, you gotta do some ""clean up"". By that, I don't mean disconnecting from a dapp in MetaMask. That won't help you, even if it makes you feel better.

**\*\*\*This token approval allowance check has to be done for every blockchain\*\*\***

*You can use etherscan or bsc scan to manually verify allowances on both chains if you do not feel confident using revoke dot cash. I know I didn't feel confident using it myself, until I verified the website through multiple sources.*

&#x200B;

Go to revoke(dot)cash and paste your wallet address,

or go to:

https://etherscan(dot)io/tokenapprovalchecker

*Better yet! To be safe, go to the legitimate etherscan website you always use, click on ""More"" in the right hand top corner, and under ""Services"" you will find the ""Token Approvals"" that will lead to the exact same link, as above :)*

*As to revoke(dot)cash, I wrote it like that so anybody can just type it in themselves without worrying about clicking on random links from reddit :)*

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*DON'T JUST GOOGLE THOSE LINKS, PHISHING LINK DO SHOW UP!!! STAY SAFE!!!\*\*\***

What did you find?

Uniswap? Curve? 1inch? Maybe a shitcoin contract you interacted with 2 years ago?

Should you revoke allowances for an old school dapp such as Uniswap or Curve? **You bet you should!** What if THEY get taken for a ride due to a bug in their smart contract? Your money will be at risk.

Disconnecting your wallet from a dapp app doesn't keep you safe. This is a great explanation of why that is the case:

## Revoking approvals vs. disconnecting apps: what's the difference?

It's easy to confuse these two processes, but they are fundamentally different:

* **Disconnecting your wallet** from a dapp involves cancelling permission for it to see your public address and your token balances, and, depending on what you originally consented to, stopping it from initiating transactions (although *not* executing them) and viewing past activity.
* **Revoking an approval/allowance** means a dapp can no longer access the contents of your wallet and move them around.

Shitcoin galore, mostly :D

Now imagine there is USDC here, with an **Unlimited Allowance**, and an **Authorized Spender you don't know**. That contract **will be able to drain** your funds even if they are on a **hardware wallet, hot wallet, metamask, paper wallet-** you name it.

You **won't even have to approve the transaction**, you already did it once before if it says **Unlimited**.

Chances are, you didn't even know that you approved the smart contract to drain your wallet. Hey, I didn't know! I just clicked next!

Look at the Angela token authorized spender- would you trust that smart contract with your money if instead of some Angela shitcoin it was authorized to spend all your USDC? You sure wouldn't!

One day you wake up, and **your money is gone**. It happened to a few people here recently. One guy lost like **$250k**. **His money was in a hardware wallet**, safe, secure, locked away. It didn't matter. That's some life changing money to a lot of us regular working folks. People jumped from roof tops over losing much less.

Most of us are not experts in Solidity. If the wallet says we gotta approve a blind transaction, we do. Obviously, most of us can't read code, and the people stealing from us know that's our greatest weakness...

**TL:DR**

**So to reiterate,**

Check ALL your addresses

Revoke ALL the allowances (do this monthly, or even more frequently)

Most of all, **DO NOT USE YOUR HARDWARE/ HOLDING WALLET TO INTERACT WITH SMART CONTRACTS!**

Your safest bet is to transfer your assets you are gonna play around with to a hot wallet, and interact with the smart contract you gotta interact with from that wallet only. No exceptions.

It's really easy to lose your money in this space. Crypto is not very user friendly yet. One wrong click can make you go broke.

It usually was, and is still, very clear who is in that position: Whales and other large holders like mining companies and exchanges.

But this trend seems to be changing over tome, especially this bear market there seems to be a very big shift of power from the bigger holders to the smaller ones, you for the basic understanding here are the definitions of the different holding groups:

* Shrimps, under 1BTC
* Crabs, 1 to 10BTC
* Fish, 50 to 100BTC

* Whales, 1k to 5k Bitcoin

Here we can see the new Yearly Absorption rates which are calculated by dividing the supply the group holds through the total circulating supply of Bitcoin. We can see how Especially Shrimps and Crabs have been increasing at record pace which is highly unusual for the bear market as the only past increases there have been during bull markets.

And especially the supply on exchanges is on a literal free-fall and nothing seems to stop it as Exchanges for the first time ever were unable to buy during a bear market but instead lost their coins at a record pace.

Also here Whales are having a decrease of supply which is rather in line with the last bear markets and actually even lower this time as even they are holding for the long-term.

This all just shows how the supply is being taken from the “richer“ holding groups and are being transferred to us Shrimps or Crabs.

117,"Deeper Network's crypto miner: a $130 ""free VPN for life"" that requires payment to use",11v5nno,"The Deeper network promises a magical product: For the low price of $130 to [$200](https://www.amazon.com/Deeper-Connect-Pico-Unlimited-Protection/dp/B09TFY1HBZ) or [more](https://www.amazon.com/Deeper-Connect-Mini-Protection-7-25length/dp/B09G27H7HQ), you can get a device that connects you to their network, and it's totally free after that payment. Or so they say. *They* won't charge you, they tell you.

Even better, because the network only uses devices connected in people's homes, this means you can access services like Netflix and Hulu, services that traditionally block commercial VPNs. It's much harder to block a VPN coming from legitimate residential addresses.

Deeper promises you this network of other nodes that will be available to you *for free and forever*, and in exchange for sharing your internet connection, you will get paid. But wait a minute. How will you get paid by other people who are using your node, if they don't have to pay to use it?

## ""Payments of DPR to use""

The Deeper CMO [addresses](https://youtube.com/watch?v=J-aSuNYmTlk&t=5m32s) this:

> So in order to use... **there's very little micro payments**, which is **payments of DPR to use**, but once we're reach a certain amount of nodes, **in order to use DPN you have to have small payments of DPR.** So if for instance Lou I'm using your node and you have bandwidth, you have great bandwidth, you set it at a price, and it's at 1/100th of VPNs cost, I connect to it, **I have to pay you some DPR**, and because you're sharing it with me you *earn* the DPR. **That's the marketplace.**

## ""Stopping users from only using""

Deeper's customer support goes even [deeper into depth](https://deepernetwork.cc/d/842-does-it-cost-dpr-token-to-access-vpn-from-pico-or-mini/2), explaining how users must forfeit some of their cryptocurrency to use it.

>**Once you use 50 MB** of data through a specific node a channel... **reserves 1 DPR** and lasts for 48 hours... This 1 DPR is pledged temporarily with the remaining portion returned to you after 7 days.
>
>...If i connect to 10 nodes and use 50MB's on each of them, **10 DPR would be temporarily locked for 7 days**, after which i would receive back 9.9995 DPR 10...
>
>This system encourages users to offer higher amounts of bandwidth while **stopping users from only using and not sharing**.

## Deeper seems be faking their network

Looking into reviews for the products, you will notice people complaining that IP addresses being used to do not belong to residential nodes. One user complains they connect to [DigitalOcean nodes](https://np.reddit.com/r/DeeperNetwork/comments/ux76i4/not_enough_nodes_too_early_in_the_game/), and [another user](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/review/B09G27H7HQ/R1D1ZKM7HKHQKO/) found their connection being rooted through AWS and Cloudflare nodes. 

This might just be speculation on my part, but if I was a company trying to make it look like my decentralized VPN was better than it really was, I might buy some $5 a month DigitalOcean nodes and set up my VPN on it, maybe grab a few from Amazon too, etc. When the hardware costs $130 minimum, it seems the price is inflated to account for a few months of extra VPN access for the people purchasing it. 

Many other reviews note the absolute garbage service, the lack of IP addresses, the slowness of network connections, etc. The device itself appears to not be made as a VPN at all, but rather a last resort for people who are trying to access blocked content... And if that's the case, trying to access streaming services like Netflix would be absolutely disastrous.

## A closed-source black box

To add insult to injury, the Deeper boxes are running some closed source operating system. Nobody knows what's inside of it, and as long as that is the case, I guess they can keep on pumping out expensive hardware. Their Unbox Therapy promo video contains a comment mentioning their CMO'ss promise to release the source code, but I can't find any video evidence of that ever happening.

# ETA: part 2

## The ""decentralized"" product is centralized

[In a single tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/helloericma/status/1635533786871119873), the CEO/CMO Eric Ma revealed he was able to shut down staking across every Deeper product. 

## It's totally secure... But download the security update

The CEO/CMO of Deeper, Eric Ma, took to Twitter to dispel rumors that the deeper product had been compromised. He [simultaneously](https://twitter.com/helloericma/status/1633352586073100295) insists that there are no security issues, but also promises security updates to prevent future security ~~breaches~~ *confusion* 

>There was recently **a FALSE report** of a security breach of AtomOS. Be assured your data and network is 100% secure...
>
>**We are, however, taking further measures** to further strengthen AtomOS so misunderstandings like this do not occur again.

Upon releasing the security update, [Deeper urged their customers to download and install it as soon as possible](https://twitter.com/deeper_network/status/1636325640629813249). It seems the security issue really was an issue.

## *Nobody* knows WTF is going on

From all the proponents of the deeper software, confusion is the top takeaway I've gotten from them. 

* Sometimes, I am told (by reading official sources) that using the DPN cost money.
* Unofficial sources tell me that the DPN is totally free for life for current users.
* Other people tell me that the official sources are talking about an app that doesn't exist, and that *it* will cost DPN... And that the official sources were talking about the *app* when somebody asked about the device.
* *Other* unofficial sources tell me that the information I have is outdated, but can't point to any updated documentation.

Long story short, the only common thread between all the sources I've seen here is that the official website and the official administrators are not to be trusted. And **for a project with closed source software, not being able to trust anybody is a huge red flag**.",lo________________ol,56,7,0.7

To my surprise, after 1 quick google search ( if you count that as research and trust the internet ) that bitcoin uses roughly about .05% of all the worlds energy in a year, compared to all the banking systems we have.

As it stands, it takes 56x more energy to run the banks compared to bitcoin.

So why does everyone always have their pitchfork and torches ready to always complain that bitcoin needs to go green.

There are tons of alternatives to run your bitcoin on a green energy source. The same energy sources we could use to promote our banking industry to also go green.

And we’re not even talking about how many people it takes to commute to work to run the banking system. It takes gas and oil just for a worker to show up to the bank. Every day, back and forth.

How many banking employees are employed throughout the world who drive everyday to work?

But I get hate for plugging in my computer and running a node?

* **Understand the basics**: Learn the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and their use cases. Familiarize yourself with key terms, concepts, and how the technology works.
* **Project fundamentals**: Research the project's whitepaper, website, and any other relevant documents. Look for: 
   * a. Problem and solution: Understand the problem the project aims to solve and how it proposes to do so. 
   * b. Use case and market potential: Assess the project's target market, use case, and potential for adoption. 
   * c. Tokenomics: Evaluate the project's token distribution, supply, and utility.
* **Team and advisors**: Investigate the project's team members and advisors, their experience, and previous successes. A strong team with relevant experience is essential for a project's success.
* **Community and social media presence**: Check the project's social media channels (Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, etc.) and observe the community's sentiment, engagement, and size. A large and active community can be a sign of strong interest and potential for success.
* **Development activity**: Examine the project's code repository on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. Look for consistent development activity, code quality, and contribution from multiple developers.
* **Partnerships and collaborations**: Assess the project's strategic partnerships and collaborations, as they can be an indicator of potential growth and credibility.
* **Roadmap and progress**: Review the project's roadmap and achievements. Ensure that the team has been meeting deadlines and delivering on promises.
* **Competitors and market analysis:** Analyze the project's competitors and its position in the market. Consider the project's unique selling points and potential challenges.
* **Regulatory environment**: Understand the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the project's target markets. Be aware of potential legal risks and restrictions.
* **Risk management**: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and diversify your portfolio to mitigate risks.

Remember that cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky, and past performance is not a guarantee of future success. Always do your own research, and consider consulting a financial advisor if you need professional guidance.

During the California Gold Rush of 1849, very few prospectors became wealthy. The majority of individuals who made money back then were those who ""sold shovels"" to the prospectors who led hard lives panning for gold, along with jeans, tents, pickaxes, and other goods and services. 

In contrast, the crypto bitcoin markets are examples of recent gold rushes. But crypto changes a lot, haves lot of different paths and **takes some work to learn the diferent concepts.** **Tools and shortcuts that promisse profits with little work became appetizing.**

With that, there are a lot of people that Sell courses rather than buying Bitcoin. Build a tool to enable users mint NFTs rather than speculating on the cryptocurrency market. Some of them really good. Most of them is not.

And I say most of them are scams because of the simple fact that **nodoby can predict the future and there are too many factors that can change the prices.**

There is excellent free and paid content available. There is dreadful paid and unpaid content available. I've seen several extremely well-done courses that are excellent for beginning investors. A course is likely to be awful if it makes any kind of return on investment.

The Golden Cross basically means that the 50 day Moving Average crosses the 200 day Moving Average, meaning that the short-timeframe upward volatility is over the long-timeframe one and thus its often seen as bullish.

The opposite of that is the Death Cross, which is usually the 200 daily Moving Average crossing the 50 daily Moving Average from the upside. And here already the scrutiny around the latest “first-ever death cross“ hype begins:

Golden Cross and Death Cross are officially just used on the daily charts but the past days some tried to use it on the weekly charts showing that we have a first ever Death Cross there. This is not how it works.

Economist Alex Kruger even tweeted “Long Bitcoin, short the bankers”. 

Reasons that could explain the rise in Bitcoin include investors realising that it might not be the best idea to park their money in stablecoins - given USDC’s woes - and swapping them for Bitcoin, Binance converting its crypto industry recovery fund from BUSD to Bitcoin, and even traditional markets expecting interest rate hikes to be lower. Of course, no one knows exactly but it’s fun to speculate the likely reasons.

Similarly, do you think Bitcoin’s current pump will be short-lived, as adrenaline-pumping it may be? And that we will witness prices below $20k again sooner rather than later?

State would get their fair share for doing nothing and it wouldn't be anything too much. Ofc profits taken would  only count if you would sell crypto for fiat, no crypto to crypto transactions would count as profit (I look at you US). Also airdrops or NFTs wouldn't count as profit untill sold for fiat either.

I would encourage crypto industry to grow and  people could invest and take profits safely. State doesn't need control or power over crypto, leaving it alone would be enough. I would  also encourage miners to move to my country and try to create pro crypto envirement. I would reduce taxes for miners that use renovable energy and blockchain programming  companies. I would  reduce taxes a bit for people that would like to take up to 10% their salary in BTC. I would also make BTC legal tender in the country with all big and medium businesses  obligated to accept BTC as a form payment. I would leave it optional for small businesses, cause forcing them to accept crypto when they barely survive in modern economy  would be bad. 

I would make crypto division in police to help people against scams, to get their lost money back and to educate. I would put in school curriculum some basic info about  BTC and crypto and open free blockchain courses on all public universities.

I would also give people a choice to save part of their retirement money ( up to 30% in BTC or ETH) in form of crypto. I would also make BTC and ETH long term ""federal"" reserves, maybe something like $20 billion in BTC and $10 billion in ETH. That is not that much money for my country.

Let's go back in time. What happend in **2013** & **2010**? 

&#x200B;

**2010**

 ""On August 15 2010, it was discovered that block 74638 contained a transaction that created 184,467,440,737.09551616 bitcoins for three different addresses. Two addresses received 92.2 billion bitcoins each, and whoever solved the block got an extra 0.01 BTC that did not exist prior to the transaction. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed.

A new version of the client was published within five hours of the discovery that contained a soft forking change to the consensus rules that rejected output value overflow transactions (as well as any transaction that paid more than 21 million bitcoins in an output for any reason). The block chain was forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the ""bad"" block chain, the ""good"" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691 at which point all nodes accepted the ""good"" blockchain as the authoritative source of Bitcoin transaction history.

The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain. Therefore, the bitcoins created by it do not exist either. While the transaction does not exist anymore, the 0.5 BTC that was consumed by it does. It appears to have come from a faucet and has not been used since.""

[Source\_2010](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident)

&#x200B;

**2013**

**What went wrong?**

""A block that had a larger number of total transaction inputs than previously seen was mined and broadcasted. Bitcoin 0.8 nodes were able to handle this, but some pre-0.8 Bitcoin nodes rejected it, causing an unexpected fork of the blockchain. The pre-0.8-incompatible chain (from here on, the 0.8 chain) at that point had around 60% of the mining hash power ensuring the split did not automatically resolve (as would have occurred if the pre-0.8 chain outpaced the 0.8 chain in total work, forcing 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain).

In order to restore a canonical chain as soon as possible, BTCGuild and Slush downgraded their Bitcoin 0.8 nodes to 0.7 so their pools would also reject the larger block. This placed majority hashpower on the chain without the larger block, thus eventually causing the 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain.

During this time there was at least one large double spend. However, it was done by someone experimenting to see if it was possible and was not intended to be malicious.""

&#x200B;

 **What went right ?**

\- The split was detected very quickly.

\- The right people were online and available in IRC or could be contacted directly.

\- Marek Palatinus (Slush) and Michael Marsee (Eleuthria of BTCGuild) quickly downgraded their nodes to restore a pre-0.8 chain as canonical, despite the fact that this caused them to sacrifice significant amounts of money.

\- Deposits to the major exchanges and payments via BitPay were also suspended (and then un-suspended) very quickly.

\- Fortunately, the only attack on a merchant was done by someone who was not intending to actually steal money

133,Advantage of holding Bitcoin in time of crisis,11v6l1k,"The global economy is facing a crisis of inflation and other internal financial crisis, such as what we are witnessing right now with recent bad occurrences around the world in Turkey and Syria a lot of people have been mad homeless and government infrastructures such as banks have been destroyed as a result of the earthquake and other natural and man made disasters that has happened in various regions.

This situation has forced many into financial hardship and the unavailability of financial institutions and services, in fact in some countries a lot of financial crisis is currently being experienced.

With most depositors no longer have access to their money through to the high centralization of the financial institutions leaving all the power over their finances in the hand of the central banks.

This crisis has forced many to start looking for an alternative way to save the money, and bitcoin is the best store of value at this point, with Bitcoin, you have total control over your finances and Bitcoin help to reduce the bank to becoming just a Junction or bus stops were our money can just pass through to carry out a transaction or exchange aside from that.

134,The Intersection of AI and Blockchain in the Crypto Industry?,11uwk1g,"At this point, it's clear that AI has made its way into the crypto industry, and as a result, AI tokens have seen an increase in prices and exposure. Given all the buzz and hype, it's natural to be curious about a lot, and while there are many great projects integrating AI into their work.

ChainGPT caught my attention, being the first advanced AI designed for blockchain and crypto, paving the way for accessible and accurate sources of knowledge and making it easier to navigate Web3.  It's a must-have AI tool with features, solutions, and utilities that include smart contracts development, risk management & AML, chart & technical analysis, advanced AI trading, blockchain & market analytics, code explainer, knowledge & guidance, code auditor, and source of news. There's also a new feature that allows you to ask questions to crypto experts, which should be interesting.

The beta prototype was recently upgraded, so you can explore it if you're interested. 

What are your thoughts on this technology? It has integrated AI and blockchain into a single platform and personally, I think this project is one that will remain relevant in the space because the blockchain industry is still in its early stages, and as technology evolves, the need for advanced AI models that can handle complex tasks and analysis will continue to grow.",Suzxy,17,5,0.78

What would you consider a good amount of crypto, of the more popular projects, to be holding? Or any projects you feel like discussing?

136,Binance's respondes to US regulators... sort of.,11v5ynl," 

Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has recently come under scrutiny from US regulators and politicians. A group of US senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, sent a letter to Binance on March 2nd, requesting financial data and raising concerns about the exchange's activities. The senators claimed that Binance and its American arm attempted to evade US regulators, evade sanctions, and facilitated the laundering of at least $10 billion.

Binance responded to the letter with a 14-page document emphasizing the exchange's compliance efforts and recognizing past mistakes. Binance's chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillman, noted in the letter that the exchange has built solid Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering policies in recent years and leverages both internal tools and tools from established third-party vendors to scan user transactions and profiles in real time. Hillman also stated that between August 2021 and November 2022, Binance stopped over 54,000 transactions as a result of transaction monitoring alerts.

Despite Binance's emphasis on compliance, the exchange's response failed to address the senators' concerns about transparency. The senators had claimed that ""what little information about Binance’s finances is available to the public suggests that the exchange is a hotbed of illegal financial activity.""

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a probe into Binance.US in February regarding trading firms alleged to be connected to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. An investigative report has suggested that Binance was behind a transfer of roughly $400 million in funds from a Binance.US account to a trading firm managed by Zhao. The exchange has also faced regulatory scrutiny in other countries, including the UK and Japan.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are difficult to regulate due to the nature of cryptocurrencies, which are susceptible to being used for illegal activities, such as money laundering. Binance is clearly trying to comply with regulations, but it is operating in a murky and difficult space. The exchange has made mistakes in the past, which is not surprising given the complexity of the regulatory environment it operates in.

The situation with Binance highlights the challenges faced by regulators in the cryptocurrency space. The lack of transparency and anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies make it difficult to track illegal activities. While some countries, such as Japan and the UK, have taken a proactive approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, many others are struggling to keep up with the pace of innovation in the space.

It remains to be seen whether Binance will be able to satisfy the senators' requests or whether they will face further regulatory action. One thing is certain, however, the world of cryptocurrency is never dull, and the challenges faced by regulators in this space are likely to continue for some time.

I really believe that even though I was down a substantial amount i.e. 70% this very easily could be one of my best investments long-term.

My wife wants me to sell now that I am close to break even (not a chance).  I am a long term investor.  I do see the importance of staying diversified though.  It would have been too hard on me if my entire retirement dropped 70%.

 There is good advice in this sub you just have to sort through a lot to realize what works for you.  Don't invest more than you are comfortable losing and Hodl are the 2 that work for me.  I do find it hilarious to say ""buy high sell low""  I've felt this way for nearly 2 years.  People recommend DCA.  This is good, but I invested quite a lot in relation to my overall retirement and couldn't stomach dca at the time.  It's not to late though.  I'm sure I'll be able to at some point.

Plenty of answers came through and I thank you for that. 

This allowed me to get a nice view of what are the possible options. Now that I have a better  picture in mind about what exchanges are out there, I would like to see  some numbers.

140,Taking profits,11uu0pn,"What is your strategy for taking profits? I want to have one before the expected BTC-fueled 2024-2025 bull run.

Looking at past performance, BTC peaked at the following times:

Nov 2021: $69k
Dec 2017: $20k
Nov 2013: $1.2k 

So if I’m making my plan based on timing history says take profits Q4 2025.  If I’m basing it off of price points, here’s what those bull run highs were compared to bear market lows:

2014 low: $111. 2017 high was a 180x gain from that point.
2018 low: $3.1k. 2021 high was a 22x gain from that point.

So if I’m basing it off price from BTC’s $15k 2022 bear market low, the 2025 peak should be between $330k-2.7m.  Now, I don’t think BTC will go that high. I think the most likely case is another lower run, in terms of increase %.  I’d put the range between a 8x-20x gain, which would be 120k-300k.

I know history doesn’t repeat, but I think it’s reasonable that it will rhyme.  I think the best plan is to not take any profits until Q2 2025 at the earliest, and no lower than 120k.

141,The high risks of crypto investments: Tales of fortune and failure,11v1r40,"When it comes to investing in speculative assets which a lot of coins are atm, important to remember that it's not all hookers cocaine and lambos. It's tempting to get caught up in the hype and the potential rewards, it's crucial to approach these investments with caution and do your research. Don't let survivorship bias distort your view of the risks and rewards. Remember that for every investor who makes a fortune, there are many others who lose money or are unable to cash out. Be realistic about the risks and potential downsides before making any investment decisions.

ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings): During the height of the ICO boom in 2017, many new tokens were launched with promises of revolutionary technology and high returns. Some of these projects did indeed succeed and made their early investors significant profits, but many others failed or turned out to be scams. However, because only the successful ICOs are typically reported in the media and discussed in online forums, there is a survivorship bias in the perception of ICOs as a whole.

Altcoins: Similar to ICOs, many altcoins (i.e. alternative cryptocurrencies) are launched with promises of innovation and high returns. However, because Bitcoin and a few other high-profile cryptocurrencies have seen tremendous success, there is a tendency to view altcoins through a survivorship bias lens. This can lead investors to overestimate the potential success of a new altcoin and underestimate the risks.

Hodling: ""Hodling"" is a term used in the crypto community to describe the practice of holding onto a cryptocurrency long-term, even during market downturns. While hodling can be a successful strategy for some investors, there is a survivorship bias in the perception of hodling as a universally profitable approach. This bias overlooks the many investors who have lost money by hodling through prolonged market downturns or investing in a cryptocurrency that ultimately failed.

Overall, it's important to be aware of survivorship bias when investing in crypto or any other asset. Remember to look at the whole picture, including both the successes and the failures, and consider the risks and potential downsides before making any investment decisions.

142,What does being a whole coiner mean to you?,11uk7eg,"Bitcoin has been doing fabulously well this week. As it stands, it spiked to $27k, and along with it, our morale. Although we see Bitcoin as a long-term investment and will DCA steadfastly into it, no matter its price action, it’s a nice feeling to watch it pump.

We know that the concept of being a ‘whole coiner’ is just our monkey brain being comfortable with a nice round number. Indeed, integer bias is well documented. Still, the notion of accumulating one whole Bitcoin is an option that people gravitate towards because achieving this milestone will make you one of the exclusive 980k people who have done likewise. To many of us, it means finishing a stacking marathon we have begun years ago. (Of course, the quest to accumulate the second Bitcoin begins soon later.) Fir better or for worse, it is a tangible manifestation of our conviction and commitment.

29 Dec, 2020 - Fear & Greed at its highest. But did it predict anything of what was to come? Or just state that the price was rising so people ""think"" the price will go down and that's just all there is.

So, if you do think this index has any value, why? I'm trying to figure this out.

144,Ditch the CEX: Four Promising Decentralized Exchanges (With pretty UI screenshots),11ushob,"Since the collapse of FTX, I went on a journey to mitigate my risk, and minimize my exposure to centralized entities. I have since proudly achieved full self custody of all my holdings, and do not rely on centralized entities *whatsoever* in my investment/trading approach. 

In my quest, I have also come across some really powerful decentralized exchanges. For most of us who use De-Fi, we know **Uniswap, Pancakeswap**, etc. as the go-to places to swap our tokens. 

However, there has been a lot of innovation in the DEX/DEX aggregator space as of late, and there are now platforms that make trading on a DEX seem like you are still using a sleek and polished centralized application.

Here are four of my favorite decentralized exchanges, to help you all on your journey to self custody. I will disclaim, I do not hold any of the tokens associated with these exchanges, and am not invested in any way - I simply have used the platforms and like what they have to offer.

**GMX (** [**https://gmx.io/#/**](https://gmx.io/#/) **)**

GMX is a decentralized perpetual exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and AVAX with up to 50x leverage directly from their self custodial wallets. It has a total trading volume of $112,878,515,563 at the time of writing. 

The exchange reduces liquidation risks through high-quality price feeds and allows users to save on costs by entering and exiting positions with minimal spread and zero price impact. Users can also open positions through a simple swap interface. GMX is currently available on Arbitrum and Avalanche networks.

GMX is an ecosystem consisting of two tokens: GMX and GLP. GMX is a utility and governance token that accrues 30% of the platform's generated fees, while GLP is a liquidity provider token that accrues 70% of the platform's generated fees. The reported APR for GMX on the site is 11.78% on Arbitrum and 11.08% on Avalanche, while the APR for GLP is reported 51.06% on Arbitrum and 42.25% on Avalanche.

dYdX is a decentralized exchange that specializes in trading perpetual contracts for digital assets. These contracts enable traders to profit from price fluctuations without owning the underlying asset and without the limitations of contract expiration. 

The dYdX protocol is based on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes smart contracts via the Starkware Layer 2 technology known as StarkEx. This allows for swift transaction processing on the platform. However, dYdX aims to decentralize the order book and matching engine fully by transitioning the protocol to its independent Cosmos-based blockchain in the V4 upgrade.

dYdX boasts an advanced, yet user-friendly interface, minimal fees, and efficient transaction processing, as well as the ability to offer up to 20x leverage on positions. 

These features, along with others, have established dYdX as a fast growing decentralized alternative to centralized exchanges (CEXs).

ApolloX positions itself as a pioneering hybrid cryptocurrency exchange that combines the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Its launch in 2021 has empowered users to engage in secure and seamless trading on both the ApolloX Centralized Exchange (CEX) and Decentralized Exchange (DEX) with leverage of up to 150x. The platform offers an extensive range of spot and futures markets, along with a comprehensive suite of trading tools and a robust ecosystem to facilitate broader access to crypto and blockchain technologies. As part of its ongoing development, ApolloX announced in 2022 a token burn program and its transition to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), known as ApolloX 2.0.

KyberSwap's suite of solutions was developed with the objective of establishing an open and decentralized liquidity framework for the DeFi ecosystem. Kyberswap allows for purchasing of crypto directly to a wallet such as metamask, without the CEX intermediary.

By employing a range of tools, KyberSwap can optimize capital efficiency across DEXes, thereby delivering the best possible rates for traders while ensuring maximum yield for liquidity providers. 

The KyberSwap solution suite is founded on the principles of accessibility and decentralization in financial infrastructure, allowing for sustainable compounding of value within the DeFi space through alignment of liquidity incentives.

Since its inception, KyberSwap has powered over 100 integrated projects and enabled thousands of users to execute transactions valued at over US$11 billion.

If your avatar doesn't appear, this means that you haven't earned any karma in the previous 37 moons distributions, or you don't have an avatar.

Each card has the following attributes:

* HP
* Attack
* Defense
* Speed
* Overall (the average of HP, Attack, Defense, Speed)
* Type (Normal, Water, Flying, Grass, Ground, Fire, Fighting, Electric, Fairy, Ghost, Dragon)
* 2 Moves (e.g. quick attack, hyper beam, surf, etc.)
* Rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Ultra Rare, Legendary)
* Moons: Moon balance at the time I ran the script
* Karma: Sum of all karma on Moon distribution files

# How are the Stats generated?

Each stat has its own custom formula, based on information about your Moons holdings, Moon transactions/tipping, karma, subreddit activity, and account age. I won't divulge the exact formulas, but generally speaking more moons, tipping, transactions, karma, and account age relate to higher stats.

There's also a random component for each stat. Each user has a base value stat from the formula, but to introduce an element of luck, the final statistic is drawn from a Normal(base\_stat, 15) distribution.

**The average of each statistic is \~50.** But this includes many users who were hardly active, so I expect most people who see this post to have higher stats than 50.

# How is the Rarity generated?

Rarity was completely random! A ""weak"" card can still be Ultra Rare or Legendary

|Rarity|Number of Cards|

|Basic|N/A (if an error occurs or you didn't earn karma from rounds 1-36, a default card will appear)|
|Common|164,552|
|Uncommon|131,985|
|Rare|24,904|
|Ultra Rare|7,932|
|**Legendary**|**330**|

# How are the Types generated?

Types were completely random with some being more common than others. The type of the card also determined the card's styling (background image + card texture)

Moral of the story? If you see arbitrum as a withdrawal option from an exchange it's for Arbitrum One not Arbitrum Nova. Apparently they're too different things 😭

But if you made the same mistake or maybe even sent your ETH to Optimism have no fear! Simply get a multi coin wallet that supports Ethereum, Arbitrum One, Optimism, etc. Then create a new wallet with your Reddit seed phrase.

Walla! There's your funds safe and sound on Ethereum or Arbitrum or wherever the fuck they are.

If you know what you are doing you can easily keep your seed phrase online as long as it's not a simple text file or some sort of note-taking app that can be accessed by anyone.

All you have to do is just write that seed phrase in a document, and encrypt the file with a very strong password. Then you can rar it or zip it again protecting it with another password. Just don't make it obvious like your date of birth lol. 

Then Load it up on some sort of cloud storage and you are good to go. Make sure to also have 2FA in your cloud storage account too (not SMS one). Don't name the file anything obvious for the hackers

Now your seed phrase is securely stored online. And before anyone says ""uhh but it's online"" yes, yes it is. But it literally takes hundreds of years to brute force a strong password with a supercomputer. You can store your seed online and have multiple backups even on your phone if you are not a complete idiot.

To get hacked like that hacker needs to:

1. find out what your email is for the cloud storage account, 
2. this means they'll need to target you specifically (highly unlikely, remember that most ""hacks"" aren't hacks, it's usually people willingly entering their seed phrase on fake websites),
3. they will need to find out your password to your online cloud storage,
4. even if you have a virus on your computer and your email and password got keylogger and sent to hackers they still need to go through the following steps,
5. they will need to hack your 2FA (good luck with that),
6. find the file and it will be hard if you have multiple files in there, especially if it's named something like ""holiday\_photos.rar"", don't just write ""MY SEED PHRASE"",
7. they will need to crack the password for the rar or zip archive first,
8. they will then have to crack that file's password which will take years to brute force it (good luck with that)

There are multiple layers of security that need to be compromised. And you'll need to be targeted specifically for that to happen. Even if you have a virus on your computer it doesn't really matter as their vector of attack is completely different, viruses will usually swap your copied address to a hacker's address etc. it's a totally different attack type.

TLDR: You can store your seed phrase online and on devices connected to the internet if you are not a complete donkey. All you have to memorise is your encrypted file's password.",rootpl,128,0,0.41

151,A (hopium-filled) theory.,11v74hm,"So, I've been thinking about crypto a lot recently, and here's what I think.

A lot of the people I know who are very much into crypto have the same story: It's not about the politics or technicality of it: most of them have the same story, they got curious about it a few years back, bought a bit of it, and saw their holdings multiply in value 10x or more. And poof, they were hooked. They're now into it for the long haul.

I think that's at least one mechanism through which (long-term) adoption happens: people get some out of curiosity, or out of necessity (need to buy ""something"" with crypto), the market goes through one of its frequent ""explosive growth"" phases, and that's enough to strongly convince them to use it as a store of wealth.

In the past few years, use of crypto in the ""developing"" world has exploded. People use it to send/receive money from abroad (the market Western Union used to have a near-monopoly on), and they also use it when their country's currency is shit (which is the case in a lot of countries) seeing too much inflation. 

Now, I was thinking: at some point, we're going to go through another of these huge growth phases (People talk about the 2024 BTC halving as the next big one. Even if it's not then, it'll be at some point. Maybe). 

When that happens, a lot of people in the developing world who are holding small sums of crypto, are going to see their holdings explode.

Matias who's working at a hotel in Belgium sends money each month back to his auntie Sofia back in Uruguay. Sofia hasn't spent everything she's got last month, and it starts growing in value, and growing and growing...

I think if this happens to many millions of people around the world, you're going to see many of them starting to accumulate crypto (even if small amounts at a time), in hope that the same thing will happen again. And that could become a new massive motor for the market/for crypto in general.

152,Remember when Canada froze bank accounts of the Freedom Convoy?,11u1605,"Remember what platform stepped up to help? Crypto did. Never forget folks.

There will never be a large scale bank run because the fed will just print their way out of it. The older I get the more case I see for BTC and what it represents.

154,Forgotten your vault password? This may help you...,11utmha,"There was a recent post from a user who had forgotten the password to their moon vault and lost their moons in the process. As someone who has experienced this first hand (RIP 10k moons) I shared a quick tip that I wish I'd known before creating a new vault

There are (some pretty specific) requirements when creating your vault password which you may have forgotten. They are as follows:

\-12 characters

\-1 special symbol

\-1 capital letter

\-1 digit

The important thing to note is that **these requirements aren't made clear when trying your password.** You may be inputting your 10 or 11 digit password, not realising it requires an unusually long 12 character minimum. And also a special symbol

So if you're inputting your regular password and it doesn't quite meet the requirements then try chucking a number (maybe 1, or your birthyear) and also a special character (maybe ! or # ) until you pass the 12 character threshold

155,Would you rather…Risk vs Reward with a 10 year prediction,11uvww7,"We all know that Bitcoin is king and leads the market. I’ve seen questions here before asking about receiving X amount in BTC vs Y vs Z. How about if you could receive a higher percentage of 1 BTC, but in some projects with a little more risk. Let’s say you could receive any of the following, BUT you had to hold, no selling or swapping, for 10 years. 


A. $27,000 - 1 BTC

B. $30,000 - 16.5 ETH (~10% more) @ $1,800

C. $34,000 - 28,000 MATIC (~25% more) @ $1.20

D. $40,000 - 125,000 MOONs (~50% more) @ $0.32


We’ve seen over the years a lot of projects enter the top 10, only to fall out and some completely die. I’m curious what members of this sub would choose. 

Would you stick with 1 Bitcoin, knowing it’s the safest and still a lot of potential? 

Would you take approximately 10% more in ETH knowing it’s currently #2, but a little more risk?

How about MATIC? Would you take 25% more, but risk it following a similar fate of prior top 10 projects and significantly falling?

Would you be a full degen and take 50% more in MOONs? Will Reddit still be around and prominent in 10 years? The hype is strong with MOONs, but do you have full faith in it?

156,What is the argument for BTC now? Where does its value come from?,11umt4c,"I've been around long enough to have experienced two pro-Bitcoin arguments/justifications. 

Firstly, there was the decentralised currency argument. It was argued that BTC has value as one can transfer value across the world, cheaply, without an intermediary. However, with limited adoption (apart from El Salvador), moderately high fees and slow transactions, this argument has fallen by the way side. 

Replacing the currency argument is that Bitcoin is a Store of Value (SoV). This argument held up very well during Covid, with Bitcoin's incredible price action. However, with higher interest rates and inflation, Bitcoin's price fell through the floor, while more traditional SoVs, like gold, held their price action very well. I've noticed that the SoV argument has become less and less used in day-to-day justifications. 

So, I am genuinely interested in what you believe causes Bitcoin's fundamental value? Is it still the SoV use case? Currency? Something else?",Laughingboy14,74,10,0.66

\-The lawsuit was filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December of 2020. The SEC is using a case that was decided in 1943 as their reasoning SEC vs. Howey. Tell me you are not out of touch without telling me you are out of touch.

Why?

\- They allege that Ripple company executives illegally sold Ripple to investors without first registering it as a security

Of course Ripple disputes this, they say the token should not be considered an investment contract and is used facilitate cross-border transactions between banks and other financial institutions.

In December of 2022 both sides submitted their final rounds, and the hope is that a judge will rule and avoid trail.

The case could settle as soon as June, but the only ruling Ripple would accept is that it is not a security.

Everyone's favorite SEC man Gary says that he views almost all crypto as a security.(Fuck YOU GARY Fuck You!) He only views Bitcoin as not being a security due to “no group of individuals in the middle,” meaning investors aren’t “betting” on an intermediary.

The SEC basically crushed Ripple from a $120 billion crypto to now a $20 billion. Still in the top coins but not where it once was. Due to its strong following it had continued to succeed but it cant be purchased by US traders until this lawsuit is over.

162,Arguments countering the environmental concerns of Bitcoin,11ux4wh,"I’ve had a few encounters where the environmental concerns of Bitcoin was used as an argument against using Bitcoin and over time I’ve come up with a few counterpoints. Especially now with SVB big in news and some news outlets attempting to use it as a blow against Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency. However, I figured I post my counter arguments in the r/Cryptocurrency hive mind to help improve my arguments for Bitcoin or point out any flaws in my reasonings. 

Some of them are direct responses and some are a bit left-field. 

Direct responses to concerns of Bitcoin using the same amount of energy as entire countries. 

1. The massive energy consumption of the Bitcoin network is by design as a security feature. This means that any rogue entity wishing to hack the Bitcoin network will need to utilise massive energy resources in order to affect the blockchain; this ties in to the security of the network. Other Layer 2 alternatives are much less energy consumptive. 

2. Bitcoin’s energy usage is opportunistic and can in theory be entirely run on renewable energy and is increasingly being done so. It is up to governments to subsidise renewable energy programs and make these cheaper than non-renewable sources.

The following is a bit more left field, and not sure how strong it would make for an argument. 

3. current major fiat currencies also have a carbon footprint associated with them on top of just the equipment needed to run the servers to process transactions, but also in the value major floating currencies have in relation to each other. The value of a major currency against another on a floating foreign exchange market is determined by speculators making bets for or against how well a country is doing economically, usually against the US dollar as the global currency, the value of which is largely tied to oil sales. The economic output of a country itself heavily relies on energy consumption to function. Obviously if Bitcoin was used as a national currency then this argument wouldn’t hold anymore.

163,Moons bear cases,11uiyeo,"So we all love moons and free money and with the recent uptrend the hype is real and we are all getting very excited. But let's take a moment to consider some bear cases, just to stay grounded and not get carried away too nuch. Here are 3 reasons I can think of from the top of my head why moons might not do as well as we hope.

- There's always the risk that Reddit might end the project because of their IPO. Actually this could happen for a variety of reasons but the IPO is the most likely one. Or maybe government regulations. Either way, moons would be kill.

- when moons are listed on a major exchange it will be easier to sell them. Everyone expects them to rise but it could could also lead to people dumping their moons and causing the price to drop.

- another risk is that whales might dump their moons. This could cause a significant drop in price and affect the overall market. The distribution of moons is not very fair and there are a few very big players that will be in the territory of life changing gains very soon...

I'm still bullish on moons overall, and absolutely love the project but please let's not get carried away and stay careful. Nothing is guaranteed ever with crypto.

To begin, start by investing in cryptocurrencies that are already experiencing a surge in value. Don't bother researching the project or the team behind it, just go with whatever is popular and seems to be going up. Once you have bought in, sit back and wait for the prices to skyrocket even further.

Once the prices have peaked, it's time to sell, right? Wrong! Hold on to your investments even as they start to fall. This is the perfect opportunity to lose even more money. Keep telling yourself that the prices will bounce back, even as they continue to plummet.

When the prices hit rock bottom, and you are left with nothing but worthless tokens, that's the perfect time to sell. Congratulations, you have just lost a significant amount of money, and you've done it with remarkable efficiency.

Some may ask, ""What if the cryptocurrency rebounds and goes back up in value?"" Don't worry, the chances of that happening are slim to none. Just accept your losses and move on to the next hot cryptocurrency, ready to repeat the cycle all over again.

167,The Reddit app is suggesting to back up your vault via cloud using Google drive. I highly suggest you do not do this.,11ua50d,"Since the introduction of Reddit vaults, each Reddit user in this sub has the ability to open up their own decentralized wallet called a Vault and collect community points on the blockchain such as Moons or Bricks via upvotes every month.   
Since this wallet is self managed it is truly your keys your crypto and you're responsibility to keep your own seedphrase backed up and secured.   
The best way to back up and secure your seed phrase is to write it down on paper and store in a safe location, although some may find the 2 minutes of work a little annoying and some users don't do this at all.   
Reddit has an option of backing up your seedphrase on the cloud via Google drive, ironically metamask mobile and coinbase wallet also has a similar option of backing up your seedphrase via Google drive or icloud.   
Seedphrase backup via cloud is one of the worst ways to store your private keys, since it's on the internet this allows a path for hackers or scammers to gain access to your seedphrase.   
People trying to steal your crypto are relentless these days and spend a lot of time and energy into trying to steal your funds via phishing, social engineering, sim swapping, scrapping data breach lists on the darkweb, some groups have turned this into a full time business, hell even North Korea does it.

168,Bitcoin as a protection against failing banks? Thoughts?,11v226t,"With recent bank failures causing concern among depositors, many may look to alternative investments such as Bitcoin. But is investing in Bitcoin really a safer alternative than keeping money in the bank? In this post, I would like to explore why investing in Bitcoin may be a safer option for those worried about the security of their money while it sits in a 'safe' bank account.

First and foremost, traditional bank accounts are vulnerable to a range of risks that can lead to insolvency. Banks can fail due to bad loans, market fluctuations, or economic downturns. This can result in significant losses for depositors, particularly those with large sums of money in the bank. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not tied to any financial institution or government. It is a decentralized currency that operates on a global network of computers. This means that it is not subject to the same risks as traditional banks and is not vulnerable to bank failures.

Secondly, investing in Bitcoin may offer greater security than traditional bank accounts. Bitcoin transactions are secured by complex algorithms and cryptography, which makes it difficult for hackers to steal or manipulate the currency. In contrast, traditional bank accounts are vulnerable to cyber attacks and other forms of fraud, which can result in the loss of funds.

Thirdly, Bitcoin offers greater privacy than traditional bank accounts. Traditional banks are required to comply with a range of regulations designed to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities. This means that banks may monitor and report on their customers' financial transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is designed to be anonymous and untraceable. This means that users can conduct transactions without fear of being monitored or tracked. I understand that KYC has its disadvantages due to government regulation (at least in the US), but it is important to realize that the banking system has more information about their clients than a crypto exchange ever would (spending habbit, direct deposits, etc.)

Finally, Bitcoin may offer greater potential for long-term growth than traditional bank accounts. While the value of traditional currencies is subject to inflation and other factors that can erode its value over time, Bitcoin has shown remarkable growth even during bear cycles. While there have been periods of volatility and price drops, the overall trend for Bitcoin has been upward.

However, it is important to note that investing in Bitcoin is not without risk. The value of Bitcoin is subject to market fluctuations and is notoriously volatile. This means that investors must be prepared to weather periods of sharp price drops and uncertainty. Additionally, the regulatory environment surrounding Bitcoin is still uncertain, and there is a risk that governments may take steps to regulate or even ban the use of cryptocurrencies.

In conclusion, investing in Bitcoin may offer a safer alternative to traditional bank accounts in the face of recent bank failures. Bitcoin is not tied to any financial institution and is designed to be resistant to inflation, cyber attacks, and fraud. It also offers greater privacy and potential for long-term growth than traditional bank accounts. However, investing in Bitcoin is not without risk and investors must carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks before making any investment decisions.

Ultimately, the decision to invest in Bitcoin should be based on an individual's risk tolerance and investment goals. Those looking for a safe haven for their money may find Bitcoin to be a more attractive option than traditional bank accounts. But for others, the risks associated with Bitcoin may outweigh the potential benefits. It is important to conduct thorough research and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions.

Edit: A fellow redditor made the comment that I did not completely lead this discussion where I intended it to go. I pretty much think that large institutions can benefit from investing their money in crypto rather than having it in liquid bank accounts where a bank may fail at any moment (the past two weeks have been rough for the financial world and that does not appear to be ending anytime soon).

169,Do you ever foresee BTC and ETH becoming fully mainstreamed and banks being a thing of the past?,11v1yqx,"It’s always crossed my mind. Is this the next logical progression for the monetary system. Are people responsible enough? Is being in charge of our own financial freedom a good thing for the masses? 

I’ve worked in customer facing roles and I’ve seen how ‘dumb’ some people are. Will their be a brick and mortar BTC house, like a bank but without the executives. 

And most importantly when $1 is in the bank, it remains $1 until we do something with it like spending. Are the general population ready to handle the swings? 

Will BTC be fully incorporated into our daily lives and not just a reserve asset that isn’t tied to fiat. Im writing this in a subreddit for crypto. So I know I might get some flack, but these questions are all important if we are to understand where we are going. 

Is BTC still considered the gold standard or is it outdated and not built for mass scalability.

170,What we can learn from Autocracies,11uksvw,"TL:DR at the end

Autocrat leaders and their countries are often under critique from media outside the own country. As we all know, autocrats don’t like being critiqued so they try their best to discredit the information. This is often done by depicting other countries and their news outlets as enemies of the own country. By framing the source of the information as the “opponent”, the autocrat then can discredit the information as an attempt from the enemy to weaken the country, its political structures or whatever. The dangerous thing about this is that once “unfriendly” countries are framed as “the enemy trying to negatively influence us” all information from this source is potentially seen as an attempt to do harm, no matter the subject.

This is a crypto subreddit, why should I care?

Probably you already know where I want to go with this. We need to be cautious not to fall into behaviour as described above. We all want crypto to succeed and in order for that to happen we need to listen to people who criticize crypto. We need to talk about the cons, as well as the pros. Not every critique is FUD and meant to harm the crypto space. Obiously, from time to time there is misinformation. But that does not mean that we should discard all information not praising crypto. We should try our best to be open-minded and this post is my attempt to bring a little bit more open-mindedness and constructive criticism into this sub.

TL:DR
Don’t discard all criticism of crypto as FUD",itskafka11161,30,7,0.67
171,"Crypto sentiment is in greed territory (64/100) after spending over a year in (extreme) fear; this is the highest level of greed since November 2021, the time of all time high",11ugjvs,"**The Crypto Fear & Greed Index** represents the levels of fear and greed in the crypto market. The scale varies from 0, which represents extreme fear, to 100, which represents extreme greed. This score is based on several factors, like volatility, market momentum (volume), social media sentiment, Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends. 

Today, this index shows **Greed with a score of 64 out of 100**. This Greed level makes sense as Bitcoin pumped 80% since the bear market low and the entire crypto market rose 59% from the low and people are very optimistic about the market right now.

[Greedy greedy!](https://preview.redd.it/6b4763j7yfoa1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9520d589da5c3dd89a8d1e809e043c955192834f)

The current sentiment is the most greedy it has been (i.e., the highest score) all the way since the November 2021, back when Bitcoin made its all time high at $69K. The current sentiment is highlighted with a green box in the chart below and the all time high period with a red box. So the last time the greed level was this high, Bitcoin was between $55K and $60K.

173,Let’s talk about Plutus,11uznm8,"I have been a user of Plutus. For those of you who don’t know, their main USP is a debit Visa with a cashback function in crypto. It - for me, I’m in the Eurozone - worked like this: I transfer EUR via SEPA, can transfer them onto the card, pay with the card and get cashback in their token, PLU. These tokens are locked for 45 days (I’m not really a fan of this policy, but that alone isn’t that terrible yet), after which I can sell them, on their platform, for EUR to top up my card. So far, so good.

Now, in recent weeks, they started to do improvements on their platform, as they claim. This involved that they suddenly removed the ability to exchange your PLU back for EUR… until July! This is assuming they keep that timeline, which time will tell.

I therefore asked how I am supposed to access my PLU funds in the next three months. They referred me to their option of withdrawal to a wallet, which I honestly cannot tell if it works, because it doesn’t work for me since they impose a 5.63 PLU minimum. This is a cashback platform, many users don’t have that much.

If it worked as they claim, again I can’t try it, it would only work once a week (on Thursday I believe), would cost around 3 EUR in gas fees, after which I would have PLU in a wallet, with follow-up fees to transfer it to a CEX and swap for hard crypto like ETH or BTC or potentially fiat.

I expressed my dissatisfaction with this situation, noting that these kinds of decisions appear like red flags to me, after which mods in their sub started deleting my comments in their official support thread for spreading FUD. All I was asking for was a way for accessing my funds. That’s really poor support, in my view.

I am not saying they are not legit, but practices like this are something that doesn’t increase my confidence. 

Time will tell, but I would urge some caution in doing business with them. We all had experiences with platforms that seemed good and then collapsed, and nobody saw any warning signs.

For me, the warning signs here are them suddenly disabling their main method of selling their token for three full months, only giving the reason they are working on improvements, imposing a minimum amount for withdrawal, and their horrible interaction and censorship of criticism in their official support thread.

176,Quick summary of the SEC vs XRP lawsuit,11upb0d,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and its co-founder Chris Larsen in December 2020, alleging that they conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP tokens. The SEC claims that XRP is a security and therefore subject to SEC regulations, while Ripple Labs and its executives argue that XRP is a currency like Bitcoin and Ethereum and therefore not subject to securities laws.

The lawsuit has been closely watched by the cryptocurrency industry, as a ruling against Ripple could have far-reaching consequences for other cryptocurrencies. As of March 2023, the lawsuit is still ongoing, with both parties engaged in a discovery process to gather evidence and prepare their cases. In September 2021, the SEC filed a motion seeking to compel Ripple to produce additional documents related to XRP sales, which Ripple has objected to on the grounds of privilege. A hearing on the motion is scheduled for April 2023.

In the meantime, the XRP market has been affected by the lawsuit, with some exchanges delisting or suspending trading of XRP in response to the SEC's allegations. Ripple has also faced legal challenges from XRP holders who claim to have suffered losses as a result of the SEC's actions. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the lawsuit, Ripple has continued to develop its products and services, including its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform, which uses XRP to facilitate cross-border payments.",maurinet79,19,4,0.7
177,Another post on how to secure a seed passphrase,11us5zp,"Vitalik's post on multisig wallets and wallets with social recovery has been reposted and looked into __ad nauseam__ now, so I will just assume that whoever reads this has already read it (if not: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11tijiv/how_i_think_about_choosing_guardians_for_multisig). There is, however, a third possibility along with multisig and social recovery, which has the great advantage of being completely chain-agnostic: Shamir's Sharing Secrete Scheme (SSSS). This is nothing new at all, many people will probably have already heard about it (although that probably doesn't mean all of them know exactly how to use it)... This post is for those who don't know and/or have only a vague idea and would like to know more. Even more importantly, this post might be helpful for those who split their passphrase into three, four, pieces hidden at different locations, or are thinking of doing so: SSSS is a mathematically secure way of doing it.

So, what is it? Essentially, SSSS allows one to create N shares from a secret (i.e. a passphrase) such as M shares suffices to reconstruct. N and M can be any, with N equal to or larger than M, clearly. The scheme has the following properties:

- any M shares out of the total N can reconstruct the secret, i.e. you don't need to worry about their order or having a particular share, unlikely the case where you - say - split your passphrase in three word groups A, B and C, where you will have to make sure to have a copy of each and to put them in the right order

- at any time, if you have the secret, you can generate new shares, in case some are lost, bringing the total number from N to N' (M shares will be needed to reconstruct the secret anyway)

- if someone gains M-1 shares, they cannot simply bruteforce the last one, because that will be as expensive as bruteforcing the secret itself

You can use such a setup however you like, either just hiding the shares in secure places you have access to, or distributing them to guardians, or some hybrid setup as well.

Finally, a few words on how to actually do it. I will only discuss what I consider the possibile best way and this will not be an extensive guide, just an outline:

- if you don't have it already, get Tails OS, the amnesiac live Linux distro. Tails is a well-respected privacy-focused Linux distro that can be booted up from a USB drive or a CD and runs directly in the RAM on your computer (i.e. the volatile memory), meaning that whatever you do in it will NOT be written to your hard disk or seen by the OS on it. Caveat: Tails must be installed on the USB drive/CD using a computer that you trust not to be infected, you must boot in it on a computer whose hardware and firmware you trust were not altered maliciously. For more info about Tails, how to install it and use it, see here: https://tails.boum.org/.

- Once you have Tails and you are comfortable enough with it, boot in it __in offline mode__. You don't need any additional software, the utility to use SSSS is already included in Tails.

- Fire up a terminal, then look up this man page to learn how to split a secret into shares and how to recombine: https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssss. Play with it until you're comfortable enough to do it with your actual passphrase. Caveat: The tool works for secrets up to 1024 bits and if you write every word of your passphrase in ful,l you will most likely exceed that limit; however, writing only the first four letters for each word will be sufficient to identify the exact word in the bip-39 wordlist. 

- Make sure you can reconstruct your passphrase using the shares.

- Write your shares down on the medium you prefer (paper, metal, etc.) and secure them (store them in safe locations, distribute them to guardians, hybrid strategy).

They were too afraid to buy when BTC was under $20k, but now when prices pump they FOMO with no hestitation... That kind of behaviour is bad for investor that should use brain to make their decisions. Don't let people talking about bullrun or greed of others dictate what you should do. If you were too afraid to buy when for months prices were very low ask yourself why you want to buy now. If it cold calculation and faith in crypto in long term or just you emotions and greed?

Will we go up or down? No one knows shit about fuck. Don't let fools fool you with talking about bullrun, we are far from it.

181,Coinbase card,11uqrl5,"Hey everybody.. trying to get a feel on the sub for who uses what and to what degree? Maybe a little discussion on rewards. 

Coinbase obviously offers to US users rewards on purchases made with the Coinbase card. Users load fiat onto the card with a fee > users make everyday purchases with no transaction fees > users earn 1-4% on different cryptocurrencies. 

This months rewards being:
1% on XLM
0.5% on BTC, ETH, MATIC and USDC


Keep in mind that when you load your card with let’s say $50 - you pay a deposit fee of 3% (at time of writing $50 USD is a $1.50 fee) 

Say I spend my $48.50 on groceries- I’ll earn “1%” (.48 cents) in XLM - less than a percent of $50. 

When you load the same card with $1,000- you pay a 2.5% deposit fee.  

Spend $1,000 on gas and groceries- earn 1% (10$) in XLM.

Unless you scale this to a large deposit to get better deposit fees OR get better reward rates (3% and higher) this seems almost negligible or even provides loss for a lot of retail investors. 

Do they ever offer 4% back on BTC or ETH? Or is it always random alt-coins? Which are subject to even greater volatility. 

Understandably this brings use case to cryptocurrency and everyday payments, but some people may use this card at a disadvantage and thought it could be discussed and maybe some people do benefit from it. 

In my opinion retail is NOT depositing their whole paycheck onto the Coinbase card and only investing “little” amounts- $1,000 and less.

Investors are in rejoice as Bitcoin price marked a whopping surge of 35% over the past 7 days. As the Bitcoin price rally continues, the Former Coinbase CTO is expecting Bitcoin to reach $1 million in the next 90 days.

Ex-Coinbase CTO Bets Bitcoin To Reach $1 Mln

Balaji S. Srinivasan, former CTO of Coinbase crypto exchange is betting with “James Medlock” a reported neoliberal over Bitcoin price to breach the enormous $1 million figure. However, Isaac Haxton, American professional poker player decided to jump in to grab the opportunity.

Haxton in a tweet stated that he can send one Bitcoin to escrow on the behalf of James Medlock if he is donating 70% to GiveDirectly. However, the Poker player added that he’ll take all of the downsides if Medlock loses and none of the upsides if he wins.

To this Ex Coinbase CTO reacted that they can do it via smart contract, however, escrow will also work. He mentioned that the rules that the escrow person would need one BTC address and one Ethereum address, while the assets would stay on-chain for 90 days.

Balaji mentioned that if Bitcoin stays less than 1 million in 90 days after the bet, then Haxton will win and get to keep one BTC and $1 million in USDC. However, if Bitcoin price breaches $1 million in 90 days then Ex Coinbase CTO will get both Bitcoin and $1 million USDC.

|Optimism |$998.31m|114|$691.38m|$67.91m|$883.8m|

Arbitrum is currently ranked fourth in TVL between all chains.  You can see the info at DeFi llama here [https://defillama.com/chains](https://defillama.com/chains) 

  

Biggest difference between these chains native tokens appears to be that the ARB token will only be used for governance while OP token can be used to pay for transaction fees although eth is the default on Optimism and Matic is used for all transactions on the polygon network.  

I'm not sure how much this will affect the possible price.

On **Thursday, 23 March** : Arbitrum goes live. Anyone who has previously has previously interacted with the Arbitrum Nova network (the native blockchain to our beloved Moons), before February is likely eligible for the ARB distribution.

It's like a threesome payday for me in the next week, with fiat mining payday coming as well. Heck, I might even upgrade my daily instant Ramen to a medium-rare steak for once!

But, there is a bigger point to make here - and it's the potential of how decentralisation and Web 3.0 can reward the ordinary man on the street who participates.

Those who participated in cc/sub, making comments and posts got rewarded with moon distribution. This is arguably Reddit's main way they have gave back to its participants. Imagine if someone like Zucker decided to launch their shitty Libra coin? Think there's any chance of US, the users being rewarded? Nah, it'll just be a cash grab by Zucker.

Second, the Arbitrum drop only happened because THEY also decided to reward the USERS in the ecosystem. Arbitrum also decided to be decentralised, put decision-making in a DAO and the founders renounced control of the token. Look at VC-infested coins like Solana. Did users get anything when they launched - NO, it was the VCs who profited from distribution and dumped on the retail afterwards.

A web 3.0 future, where **USERS** are the ones who get **Rewarded** for their participation, and not greedy corporates or their buddies is the ideal vision for all of us. Kudos to Reddit and Arbitrum for showing the way, and hopefully more will follow suit in the future.",Every_Hunt_160,53,16,0.7

In terms of mathematics 30 years is nothing. But the current technology grows so fast that we will probably iterate through these concepts faster than expected. Is this the tip of the iceberg? What other concepts are already in the pipeline? What could be used as **the next next big milestone**?

**Can you recommend me papers, forums or other platforms where I can read and gather a broader overview of what could be in store for us? Other cryptographic proofs? Scaling solutions?**

Educating our youth about Bitcoin may be a radical move and is probably frowned upon by the mainstream educational authorities, especially since almost all countries in the world are developing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in some way or another. Nonetheless, Mi Primer Bitcoin, a BTC education advocacy, has launched an English diploma program related to Bitcoin in El Salvador. It is projected to reach out to more than 10,000 students - quite an impressive feat.

“Not your keys, not your coins” involves a learning curve that people inducted into the world of Bitcoin must conquer. It is composed of a mindset shift since you must be ready to accept full responsibility of your Bitcoin as no one will come to your rescue when you succumb to hacks and scams. Still, the idea of having full autonomy of your assets is intoxicating. Bitcoin may be the only reliable non-custodial way of managing your finances that is available currently.

Hence, if a non-profit organisation were to launch Bitcoin educational programs that are similar to Mi Primer Bitcoin’s offerings in your country, would you support or oppose it? Or remain non-committal until this organisation has formulated a track record?",cryotosensei,26,8,0.65

199,"I have developed a new validation protocol, PON",11u9o7s,"Proof-of-Nudes (PoN) protocols are a class of consensus mechanisms for blockchains that work by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of nudes in the associated cryptocurrency. This is done to avoid the computational cost of proof-of-work schemes.

Proof of Nudes uses a manual validation of nudes to verify transactions, requiring a potential attacker to view more nudes than humanely possible. This incentivizes validators to view as many nudes as they like. PoN is more energy-efficient because people are already viewing nudes so it's a kill two birds with one stone kind of thing.

The first coin that will use this technology is called SPANK. SPANK can be mined by submitting your nudes to the validators called BANK.  SPANK BANK validators will rank the nudes from 1-10 and after 20 validations are complete, the average rank will determine how many new coins are added to the blockchain and given to the miner.

This is just a small list of things happening in the world right now that are certainly not positive, i'm sure I missed alot more in the list above but with all of the above unfolding in front of our eyes in such a short amount of time, with probably much more pain to come soon for the stockmarket.

While this ecosystem was once dominated by whales, this is now becoming less and less the case. 

# Criticism of Bitcoin 

The main criticism of Bitcoin is that the digital currency will not be fairly distributed. People often argue that if Bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency soon, a very small group of people will hold all the power.

In a way, this is understandable and makes sense for outsiders to see it this way. It is still difficult to explain that Bitcoin is actually the fairest way to launch a new monetary system. Everyone had a chance to participate from the very beginning.

What we are seeing now is that ""people"" are taking an increasingly large share of the entire Bitcoin. While it was still an ecosystem dominated by whales before, we are now seeing more and more small holders who own relatively small amounts of BTC.

# Bitcoin shrimps and crabs

In particular, the so-called shrimps (<1 bitcoin) and crabs (1-10 bitcoin) are currently consuming large amounts of bitcoins. According to Glassnode, shrimps are buying over 100 percent of the annual production of the primary cryptocurrency. In the case of crabs, this is 119 percent

So even if miners sell 100 percent of their production, these two cohorts are still buying more bitcoins. Of course, they are buying this Bitcoin from the market.

As a result, fewer bitcoins are available for sale, and the relative scarcity of the digital currency is increasing. The more bitcoins shrimps and crabs buy, the harder it is to acquire it. Ultimately, this could only have a positive impact on the price.",plug_and_pray,178,156,0.82
206,"Basics of crypto storage, Web3 and security",11uewx9,"As someone who has been in crypto for close to 6 years I see people who are just getting into it making some of the same mistakes over and over. Here are a few things I think everyone should do in their first few months owning crypto

1) learn about and invest in a hard wallet 

2) be overly cautious or even paranoid about signing into your wallet/where you store your seed phrase

3) try and use some of the tech that your investing in 

I’m sure we have all seen the posts that have gone around for as long as crypto has existed that follow the theme of “I lost (a large sum of money) because my wallet was hacked or I gave out my seed phrase” that’s shits scary especially when your balls deep into crypto. 
The best way to avoid situations like that are first investing in a hard wallet also known as a physical place to store your crypto(not online) and make sure your seen phrase is 100% offline. 

After you get your hard wallet your going to set up an online wallet somewhere like MetaMask in order to interact with platforms like sushi swap or coinbase. That online wallet will serve at a sort of passage between your hard wallet (cold storage) and the outside world on the internet. Your hard wallet should never come into contact with anything on the internet besides your own MetaMask. 
This is to prevent people from being able to get into your larger stores of crypto that is kept on the hard wallet. In addition to this when you create a seed phrase for the love of god don’t put it in your notes app or google drive, people can target and hack those platforms and then they have all your crypto. Write it on paper and keep it in a safe place or better yet memorize it. 

When it comes to the first point I made above I think everyone should try to understand and even build something on web3 in order to better comprehend the space that so many of us are dumping our hard earned fiat into.

What that means is it will have a super positive sentiment when things are going well and super negative when things go poorly. And of course plenty of wild price predictions as well. Not the best place for accurate info to say the least! 

Where that greed/fear really helps is when it comes to hacks and scams. We all want to protect our crypto. And we are happy to share info about hacks and scams in real time. I’ve personally saved a good chunk of my crypto after I left Celsius from seeing concerns about it on this sub.

It’s fun to speculate and share the occasional useful news article. But the real utility of r/cryptocurrency is a decentralized source of information for evaluating scams and hacks in crypto. And that is quite a useful thing! So thank you all!",JustCommunication640,59,24,0.83
210,Exploring the Underlying Values of Blockchain Technology,11uz9qw,"Blockchain technology is often associated with technical and financial innovations, but it also has important implications when it comes to societal and personal values, that are worth exploring. Values, whether they are externally imposed or self imposed, refer to principles or guidelines that help us guide our choices and actions, with the goal of living a meaningful and coherent life. If we hope for blockchain and cryptocurrencies to revolutionize our financial and social systems, we must give more importance to the underlying philosophy of this movement. In this post, we will explore how blockchain technology intersects with the (overlapping) values of trust, authenticity, decentralization, permanence, justice, self-responsibility, and community.

**Trust and Transparency**

Trust is a fundamental value that involves a belief in the reliability, integrity, and honesty of others. Blockchain technology promotes trust by enabling transparent and secure transactions that are verified and validated by a decentralized network of participants. Unlike traditional centralized systems that rely on intermediaries such as banks or governments, blockchain networks are designed to be transparent, decentralized, and trustless. This means that participants can interact directly with each other, without the need for intermediaries, and trust that the transactions are authentic and secure. Besides peer-to-peer financial transactions, blockchain technology can be used to verify the authenticity or ethical status of products, such as organic food or luxury goods, by tracking their origin, production, and distribution through a tamper-proof and transparent ledger **\[1\]**. Blockchain technology can also be used to create digital identities, such as passports or licenses, that are verifiable and secure, without the need for centralized authorities **\[2\]**.

**Authenticity**

Authenticity is another important value related to the functioning of blockchains. Authenticity involves being true to oneself, expressing one's unique identity, and seeking genuine connections with others. Blockchain technology enables authenticity by providing an immutable ledger that ensures the integrity and verifiability of digital assets and transactions. The immutable ledger ensures that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, thus ensuring the authenticity of the data. For example, blockchain technology can be used to create digital art or media that is authenticated and verified, enabling artists to sell and protect their creations in a secure and transparent way (NFTs, Reddit Avatars **\[3\]** etc). Blockchain technology can also be used to create self-sovereign identities, where individuals have control over their own personal data and can share it in a verifiable and secure manner **\[4\]**.

**Decentralization**

Decentralization is a value that involves empowering individuals, promoting self-organization, and respecting individual agency and autonomy. Blockchain technology promotes decentralization by enabling a distributed network of participants to validate and verify transactions, without the need for centralized authorities. This decentralized network ensures that no single entity has control over the network, thus ensuring its resilience and independence. For example, blockchain technology is a foundational aspect of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications **\[5\]** that enable users to interact directly with each other, without the need for banks or other intermediaries. Decentralized networks can also be used to create social networks that are owned and controlled by their users, rather than by centralized corporations, reducing the risk of algorithmic bias and censorship **\[6\]**.

**Permanence**

Permanence involves seeking a sense of continuity, stability, and meaning in life. Blockchain technology aligns with this spiritual value by providing an immutable and permanent record of transactions that cannot be altered or deleted. This ensures that the data recorded on the blockchain is permanent and cannot be lost, modified or erased. Blockchain technology can be used to create permanent and transparent records of land ownership, reducing the risk of disputes and fraud. It can also be used to create permanent records of medical records, enabling patients to control their own data and share it with healthcare providers in a secure and verifiable way **\[7\]**. As we will discuss bellow, permanence, paired with transparency, is a central force in reducing corruption and tracking down criminal activities.

**Justice**

Justice, as we know, involves promoting fairness, equity, and respect for human rights. Blockchain technology promotes justice by enabling transparent and decentralized systems that ensure equal access and opportunity for all participants. Blockchain technology also promotes accountability, by providing an auditable and verifiable record of transactions that can be used to hold individuals and organizations accountable. A potential application of blockchain technology in this direction is in the creation of transparent, pseudonymous and accountable voting systems **\[8\]**, reducing the risk of electoral fraud and ensuring that every vote is counted accurately. The nature of the blockchain favors justice when it comes to crime by providing a clear and permanent ledger on which to track down transactions related to crimes **\[9\]**, whether it be payments, funding, laundering or theft. No one can hide on the blockchain. In a more preventive vision and as discussed in the beginning of this post, blockchain technology can also be used to create decentralized supply chains that ensure fair labor practices and ethical sourcing of materials.

**Self-Responsibility**

Self-responsibility is probably one of the heaviest values related to blockchain technology. Blockchain networks are designed to enable individuals to take control of their own data, assets, and identities. This promotes self-sovereignty, self-determination, and self-responsibility, which are important values for personal growth and spiritual development. By providing individuals with secure and verifiable digital identities, blockchain technology enables them to participate in digital ecosystems without having to rely on centralized authorities or intermediaries. This requires individuals to take responsibility for their own digital footprint, privacy **\[10\]**, and security **\[11\]**. By promoting self-responsibility and permanence of data, blockchain technology can encourage individuals to take ownership of their own lives and become more engaged and proactive members of their communities.

**Community**

Community is another value that is closely tied to blockchain technology. Blockchain networks are designed to be decentralized and open, which enables the creation of new communities and the strengthening of existing ones. Blockchain technology creates new opportunities for people to connect with each other, share their ideas and values, and collaborate on projects that align with their spiritual and social goals. For example, blockchain technology can be used to create community-driven platforms for crowdfunding, where members can support each other's projects and initiatives **\[12\]**, as well as community tokens to reward meaningful contributions to communities **\[13\]**. Blockchain technology can also be used to create decentralized marketplaces that enable small businesses and entrepreneurs to connect with their customers directly, without the need for intermediaries. By promoting community building and collaboration, blockchain technology can contribute to the growth and development of more vibrant and constructive communities **\[14\]**.

**Conclusion**

By promoting trust, authenticity, decentralization, permanence, justice, self-responsibility and community, blockchain technology has the potential to contribute to a more conscious, just, and interconnected society. As we continue to explore the potential of blockchain technology, it is important to remember that its ethical implications are just as important as its technical and financial innovations. By integrating conscious and ethical values into our technological innovations and encouraging open and insightful dialogue, we can create a more balanced and meaningful future for ourselves and for future generations.

\~

**TLDR: Blockchain technology promotes the values of trust, authenticity, decentralization, permanence, justice, self-reasonability, and community; a set of values that can help us move towards a more conscious financial system and world.**

211,"Bitcoin returns are almost 50% YTD in 2023. They are great now, but the hardest part is realising that for traders who lost 65% in Bitcoin in 2022, they are not at down 15% from 2022 but rather still almost ~50% down",11tqdub,"I must say I am quite surprised. The markets and this sub has seen so much jubilation since prices and returns are up. Maybe it is just that their voice are drowned out or that they have left the sub due to disappointment, but I have not come across much at all of a dose of reality for hodlers. 

Bitcoin lost around 65% of it’s value from the beginning to the end of 2022. We went from around $46,311.75 to $16,547 thereabout, which amount to about 65% in losses. Yes, 2023 has absolutely started off with a bang, but it is a bang after the dim embers of 2022. We gained nearly 50% thus far for the year, and while they are great numbers, rolling over from 2022, they are just a drop in the bucket in recovery.

If you held on last year from beginning to end, you would have lost 65% of your investment.  If you held on from the start of 2023 till today, you would have gained almost 50% YTD. But remember, you gain *50%* **on 35% remaining from 2022, that is to say you only truly gained \~17.5%. So, you are still down almost 50% from the start of 2022.**

This may be obvious to more experienced traders among us, but many new traders stumble into this pitfall. You make risky bets and if/when you lose, you think you can make it back but there’s a reason investment brokerage and exchanges are so profitable. If you lose money, it takes monumental effort and time to make it back just to breakeven. And ironically, big losses tend to make traders take even more risk and lose even more.

Everybody gets wrapped up in the percentage returns, especially on the media and advertisements telling you all the money you can make but never advise how bad a single loss can set you back. Because most just advertise for platforms that want your fees with total disregard to whether you win or lose. And this is  exactly how they also get you with leverage, leverage(without really in-depth information, extensive research and a strong market edge which very very few traders do/have) is a losing gamble. And even then it’s still risky which is why firms typically hedge by trading the opposite site in another instrument. You will only win with leverage until you lose but trading platform get their fees either way.

I know this whole post is obvious to some but it is definitely not to all. Don’t just dismiss it.All you see in media is the allure of short-term big percentage returns but not the full reality of risk and even a single loss. I think it very much needs to be said.",OneThatNoseOne,114,99,0.81
212,Advantages crypto has over today’s banking system,11up4hm,"1. Decentralization: Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized,meaning they are not controlled by a central authority Making them less vulnerable to manipulation and interference.

2. Security: Cryptocurrencies use advanced encryption techniques to secure transactions and keep user information private

3. Faster Transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions can be completed in seconds or minutes, whereas traditional banking transactions can take days or even weeks to complete.

4. Lower Fees: Transactions typically have much lower fees than traditional banking transactions. This is because crypto doesn’t require middle men like banks to process transactions.

5. Accessibility: Anyone with internet connection can use crypto regardless of their location or financial status. This makes them accessible to millions of people who may not have access to traditional banking services.

6. Greater Transparency: Crypto provides a high level of transparency, allowing users to track every transaction and ensure that their funds are being used as intended.

214,A short write-up about why Bitcoin could go sky-high while we see gradual failures of DeFi protocols. USDC / USDT addressed...,11ucdq4,"I'm not a financial advisor. None of this is financial advice.              

So, no doubt everyone was nervous about the USDC depegging event a week ago. I certainly was.                   

But here's why: I work in the industry and one of the companies I work for has a treasury in USDC. Last weekend I was looking at the charts for a stablecoin that was created by a company that was ""playing by the rules"" and had made no wrong moves.                  

People at the company floated the idea of using other stablecoins, but noted that the situation wouldn't be that much better if we went with tether.                  

But the thing is, I started thinking about, ""Well, what if USDC depegs again, but the depeg is longer-lasting? People will lose confidence in the idea of a properly-collateralized stablecoin.""                

That's why I think bitcoin started pumping this last week. When you trust a stablecoin you're trusting two parties; 1 - the blockchain it's on as well as... 2 - the method it uses to match itself to the USD.               

Maybe my thesis is wrong. We'll find out soon enough.           

#EDIT: I'm dumb. I forgot to substantiate my claim in the OP. Please see below.                

If there is a day when stablecoins see a failure to maintain their 1:1 pegs on the dollar, due to whatever reason, then DeFi protocols are at greater risk of collapse than bitcoin. In the previous sentence I said, ""due to whatever reason"". So a question to ask here is, ""What if all the banks that hold USD begin to show weakness with their USD reserves? What if we see something like the SVB situation on a larger scale?"" It's also worth noting that the bank that collapsed last time was buying U.S. Treasury Bonds and they still went under until they got FDIC insurance to kick in and made all of their customers whole.",sgtslaughterTV,20,7,0.68

Hypothetical crap….

What if the government bailed out crytpo firms??   They say they wouldn’t, but what if?

Imagine, a dark(er) day(s), FTX goes down, the gov offers a bailout simply in the name of their citizens and the protection of their hodl’d goodies..  If others go down, more bailouts.. RH, CB, WS, whoever.

Instead of regular repayments, the government then takes it in crypto…. This event coupled with the already hodl’d holdings of bad guy crypto funds, puts the government as one of the largest holders of various coins.

Do they even need to centralize this at that point?  They could in essence act as the largest whale controlling and manipulating the market as they accumulate, confiscate and get repaid for various bailouts…

Could they ever take enough to rock the system or have any sort of control?  Saying this happened, couldn’t they theoretically drag the price down to the point of launching their own digital currency which would then look like a rockstar standout?

The gov’s work in secret ways, coupled with the decentralized, anonymous nature of crypto, how would we ever know?

222,Binance screwed me on my latest purchase. Any suggestions?,11uwvv9,"Recently I've been looking for the cheapest way to make my monthly crypto purchase and transfer into my Ledger wallet. I deposited $200 into Binance, half for BTC, half for ALGO. Here's the breakdown:

* I bought $100 of BTC, and received 0.00468369 BTC, which at the time of purchase, was worth $95.37.  $4.63 of my initial $100, gone.
* When I transferred to my ledger wallet, I paid a fee of .0002 BTC, which at the time was equivalent to $5.48. 
* So I spent $100 to end up with $89.89 of BTC in my Ledger wallet.

Algorand was slightly less terrible, mostly due to (much) cheaper network fees. I spent $100 to add $95.46 worth of ALGO to my Ledger.

So 10.11% of my BTC purchase went to fees, and 4.63% for ALGO. Both of those fees are unacceptable if you ask me.

So needless to say, I did NOT find a cheaper way to buy crypto than CoinBase Advanced Trader. Does anyone have any suggestions for the cheapest way to put BTC and ALGO into my Ledger?

224,Friday was the second day this week that crypto decoupled from US tech,11uip3a,"On Monday the NASDAQ dropped while crypto rose (as did gold).  The same thing happened Friday (yesterday), as Russia tensions grew on Finland's NATO announcement.

Since the dawn of crypto, there have been two main investment narratives for this novel asset class:
1. Crypto is a high-risk asset that sells off in times of fear in close correlation to speculative tech stocks.
2. Crypto is a safe haven asset that will rise in times of fear because it is not dependent on establishment finance and governments.

We should be careful not to create a false dichotomy as these two narratives likely have always coexisted in influence.  The vast majority of prior evidence suggests that 1 is the far more prevalent narrative, but two days this week show us that people have not given up on 2.  If crypto is going to grow into the digital safe haven that purists have envisioned, now would certainly be a sensible time to do so.  I, for one, will be watching charts very closely next week.

225,Don't rely on revoking tokens. It's too late and will not going to prevent you from being drained by most scams. The best practice is to approve only the amount needed for dApp and use a separate hot wallet.,11uioig,"Revoking is useless against the majority of scams.

**If there were a malicious dApp, you'd be drained immediately after approving unlimited spending before you even had the chance to revoke it.**

Revoking is only good against dApps that started out honestly but later either had a bug exploited or decided to rug pull later on.

And sometimes revoking isn't even easy to do. When Arbitrum One first launched, there was no revoke tool and you had to manually revoke tokens through each token contract's *approve(spender, amount)* function.

**Instead, the best practices are:**

**1) Don't interact with sketchy dApps**: But that's a separate topic.

**2) Approve only the necessary spending limit**: During the approval request, [you can edit the allowance](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6055177143579-How-to-customize-token-approvals-with-a-custom-spend-limit) in your wallet's software client. Once you've finished your swap or trade, the remaining allowance amount will automatic decrease by the amount used and drop to 0.

**3) Use a separate hot wallet**. Keep most of your funds in a cold wallet where they're safe and never interact with dApps.

It doesn't hurt to regularly check for tokens to revoke, but please don't rely on it.

**Hardware devices**: If you have hardware devices to secure both your hot or cold wallets, that's even better protection. But not everyone will need one since it's expensive and not everyone has a large account.

Contrary to common advice, if you only have one hardware wallet, it's better to secure the hot wallet first, not the cold wallet. Cold wallets are already safe from most attacks since they don't interact with anything except for the hot wallet. In fact, delete your cold wallet's software client if you're not using it. You should already have its seed stored elsewhere in multiple locations.",FluffayPenguin,12,2,0.58

In my opinion its better to buy value and dividend stocks for the more or less safe haven. But use the planed ten bagger money inside the crypto space.

228,If the United States fell into an economic civil war,11uv5b5,"How do you believe it would effect the crypto markets.

I asked our good friend chatgpt and this is the generic response generated.

""An economic civil war between the blue and red states in the USA would have significant repercussions not just for the country, but for the global economy. The crypto market, in particular, would be impacted as investors would become increasingly risk-averse and seek to safeguard their assets. This could lead to a decline in crypto prices as investors move to more traditional safe-haven assets. Additionally, such a conflict would create a highly unstable economic environment that would be difficult for any market to navigate. It's essential to note that such a scenario is unlikely, and the best course of action is for all parties to work towards finding common ground and implementing policies that benefit the country as a whole.""

Hopefully we can do better here to predict the implications.

But the current price-levels may be worth a lot more than we though. One way to “measure“ the importance of a level is to see what percentage of the whole circulating supply has been bought there. Areas where a lot of the supply was bought up act as the most important support/resistance areas.

This chart from glassnode shows how our rise of 22% to $26k has also meant a 20% surge in the Supply in Profit metric, meaning that 20% of the whole supply was purchased just between $20k and $26k. This makes our flawless run through there early this week even more impressive as many probably took profits here but we just kept rallying on.

We seem to be downplaying the current price-levels as just “low“ currently but in reality those are probably one of the most important price levels if we take a look at Bitcoin history thus clearing them is highly impressive and also crucial for the foundation of the next bull run, whenever that may be.",partymsl,29,29,0.75

231,I am interested in how the community feels about IOTEX,11uqveh," As the title states, I am just interested in how the overall crypto community views IOTEX? I have tried to look into IOT in general and the main two cryptos I have found are IOTA and IOTEX. 

I read some info that said IOTEX is working with the US NAVY but I'm not sure if it's true or not. Or even if it matters. I would think that it shows a great deal of trust and potential for growth if they are indeed partnering with the military. However, I am also aware of the great amount of waste, cronyism, and failed ventures with the military in the past. 

So anyway, how does this crypto look to everyone? Does it have potential? Can it compete with IOTA? Is it a scam? All honest opinions welcome and thanks in advance.

I myself, and I think many others on here, want to be a part of crypto, but unfortunately cannot invest too much. I obviously know the benefits of diversification when having large amounts of money invested in something. But my question is, is it still worth it to diversify if you're only DCAing maybe $100 or $200 a month? Or with that small of an investment, should I just stick to investing in one of the bigger, ""safer"" assets like Bitcoin and just call it a day? 

Also, if you think diversification is still important, how would you go about it? Would you split a $100 DCA into smaller chunks and buy small amounts of a few different assets, or alternate every month (buying $100 of one asset one month, and buying $100 of another asset the next month)?

The host of CNBC’s financial TV show “Mad Money” has given guidance to investors numerous times, but often that advice has turned out to be wrong.

The South African entrepreneur ironically supported the “Inverse Cramer” strategy – a plan that helps investors bet against the stock picks of “Mad Money’s” host. The Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (ticker SJIM) was designed to perform in the opposite direction of the TV personality’s advice. Some cryptocurrency participants have recently claimed that betting against Cramer could be an appropriate investment strategy since his predictions on the future performance of digital currencies, such as bitcoin, have not been quite precise.

236,Blankos Block Party - A Review of the first blockchain game listed on Epic Games Store,11u9jvy,"**This is a review of Blankos Block Party**, the first blockchain game released on the Epic Games Store in Dec 2020 as an early-access game. The full game wasn't launched until Sept 28, 2022.

TL;DR review at the bottom

[ Flying over the Junction map ](https://preview.redd.it/17xzfedx5eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d191cebd25f40a28d6f3c4a22b4ef66360b99945)

## Intro

**Blankos Block Party** is a traditional F2P game that I later found out only has scant traces of blockchain properties. The characters you buy are minted on the private Mythical blockchain. Each character has slightly different traits and can be leveled up in-game.

Blankos is a multiplayer party game with 3 main modes:

* **Racing**: Race against other players on a dangerous camp and get to the finish line first.
* **Vibe Collection**: Collect the most vibe objects on the map faster than everyone else.
* **Shooting**: Shoot other players and KO more than everyone else.

Every mode has many different maps. Some are dev-created, and some are user-created, so there's a huge variety.

[ Brawl waiting area ](https://preview.redd.it/i8idsyaz5eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3964de358d0bcf8d88cb73a31e06e2fa83a85f23)

## The Characters - Blankos

[Right Blanko is the free one every gets at the start. Left Blanko is a free giveaway from the marketplace.](https://preview.redd.it/ne3f12u06eoa1.jpg?width=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c551573948c781d01ab4ff5be73aa0d300f4355d)

You start out with a newbie Blanko. Each Blanko has its own special properties, moves, and abilities. The vast majority of the paid ones are about $5-10 and are minted through the Mystical marketplace store. The most expensive ones can be hundreds of dollars. You earn \~10 Blanko Bucks per game you play, which takes about 10-20 minutes to finish. You need about 1000 BBs for the cheaper paid Blankos, so it takes 100 games to get there. It's totally not worth your time unless you love the game.

Each Blanko can be leveled up and given perks (like Call of Duty) for additional special abilities like flying higher, spinning longer, recharging faster, or having a shield.

## The 4 Modes

There are a lot of veteran players here with high-leveled Blankos and special abilities. They will dominate your free Blanko, so don't expect to win your first several matches.

It takes about 3-5 minutes to match with other players in a Brawl, which is a set of 3 games with randomized modes and maps. Some maps are poorly designed while others are amazing.

**Racing**

This is like those Mario 64 / Mario Galaxy racing games where there's a bit of platforming. Every map is different. This is my favorite mode.

[Racing - Like Mario Kart, but worse and with platforming](https://preview.redd.it/osm7wlo56eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc3441a2a927047d9fa4786ee3e80a459c1bd817)

**Vibe Collection**

You're put into a room with lots of vibe objects. Collect them faster than everyone else. Some of the better maps require a bit of difficult platforming, but most are bland. This is my least favorite mode.

[Vibe Collection - Get as many lightning objects in the limited time](https://preview.redd.it/w226h1oa6eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9f4216e39fcbcb13543cf5626ad00c20fc410e9e)

**Shooting**

It's a standard Death Match. Collect guns and ammo in a room, and KO more people than everyone else. There are only 3 main types of runs (handgun, semi-automatic, and rocket launcher). This mode is broken. People were killing me in 3 seconds while I could shoot them for 10 seconds in a row while not doing any damage. I later found out that there is considerable lag and the players were abusing this by constantly jumping up and down, which somehow ruins the hitbox.

[Knockout - A basic deathmatch](https://preview.redd.it/9evygwdf6eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a2886c9066bcce1d1c8c268a2ccc6503dfe6523f)

**Junction**

I'm not exactly sure what this is. It's an open-plaza of many locations. I think it was intended as a meeting place for people to hang out when not playing. However, it's empty like most of Decentraland. It would be really cool if they added gameplay modes here, but there's currently nothing to do here except explore by yourself.

[The rocketpack is awesome](https://preview.redd.it/f86mnv6i6eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dd0f09dad85452977e0658f2354daee3daf22aa4)

## The Blockchain Element

This is one of those traditional games that doesn't need a blockchain. You wouldn't even notice if they replaced the blockchain with a traditional database.

All sales are done in fiat. You can't connect your wallet to the blockchain or marketplace.

The Blankos and player items are minted on the completely-private Mythical blockchain. This blockchain is only used for the 2 Mythical games: Blankos and Rivals (an NFL fantasy-league-like collection game). It's so private there isn't even a blockchain explorer.

The only connection to a public blockchain is through the Ethereum bridge. You can bridge your Blankos to the Ethereum mainnet using Mythical's website, and then sell them as NFTs on OpenSea.

## My Ratings

**Gameplay**: 3/5 - There are plenty of more-enjoyable traditional multiplayer games. There's nothing special about Blankos.

**Blockchain**: 1/5 - Barely uses the blockchain and would do just fine without one.

When I was younger, I used to play games so much I probably went 2 full decades where I completed a new game every week. Nowadays, I don't have that much time, so if a game doesn't interest me after a day, I just drop it. Blankos Block Party is one of those games I drop. It barely qualifies as a blockchain game, so I wasn't curious enough to stick around.

Blankos is more fun than many other crypto games I've played, but that's an awfully-low standard. It's like playing Mario Party, but sober and with random strangers. The only reason Mario Party and Wii Sports were fun for me when I younger is because I played with my roommates, and they were stupid fun when we were all drunk.

* **Racing** is like Mario Kart + Fall Guys, but worse
* **Shooting**: is like Unreal Tournament, but way worse
* **Vibe Collection** is like a typical timed fetch/item collection quest, and who enjoy fetch quests?",Maleficent_Plankton,6,7,0.89

I bet at least one of us has been socially engineered into disclosing our key phrase during a game of drug fueled charades... I'm not judging and you shouldn't either, criminals are wily and use many tactics to get the goods. The goods being our sweaty bags of tokens.   


The FTC has some things to say about scammers such as: ""**Never mix online dating and investment advice**. If you meet someone on a dating site or app, and they want to show you how to invest in crypto, or asks you to send them crypto, that’s a scam. ""   


They might even ask you to pay for sex with crypto, don't do this unless prostitution is legal where you plan to do the dirty, because if it's not the police won't help you get your money back if your hooker doesn't put out, and that would be doubly sad.    


Or ""**A scammer pretends to be a celebrity who can multiply any cryptocurrency you send them.** But celebrities aren’t contacting you through social media. It’s a scammer. And if you click on an unexpected link they send or send cryptocurrency to a so-called celebrity’s QR code, that money will go straight to a scammer and it’ll be gone. ""  


If Willy Nelson starts texting you asking for some THC coin it's maybe... okay probably, a scam.  


""**Scammers impersonate well-known companies.** These come in waves, and scammers might say they’re from Amazon, Microsoft, FedEx, your bank, or many others. They’ll text, call, email, or send messages on social media — or maybe put a pop-up alert on your computer. They might say there’s fraud on your account, or your money is at risk — and to fix it, you need to buy crypto and send it to them. But that’s a scam. If you click the link in any message, answer the call, or call back the number on the pop-up, you’ll be connected to a scammer. ""     


Scamazon 1984, Microsoftcore, and Feds Expressing Themselves are not companies that will ask you for crypto, don't send anyone claiming to be them your keys or anything else.  


""  **Scammers impersonate government agencies, law enforcement, or utility companies.** They might say there’s a legal problem, 	that you owe money, or your accounts or benefits are frozen as part of an investigation. They tell you to solve the problem or protect your money by buying cryptocurrency. They might say to send it to a wallet address they give you — for “safe keeping.” Some scammers even stay on the phone with you as they direct you to a cryptocurrency ATM and give step-by-step instruction on how to insert money and convert it to cryptocurrency. They’ll direct you to send the crypto by scanning a QR code they give you, which directs the payment right into their digital wallet — and then 	it’s gone. ""  


TLDR: If you want to read about what the FTC has to say about crypto scammers you can check out the link. Personally I don't feel like they put much effort into the site, not a single dick joke or sexual innuendo <disappointed face>

240,I'm glad I didn't give up last year,11tjyg7,"I know we're still not in some crazy bull market yet but it's almost unbelievable to me seeing us pumping up this high. These are prices that seemed unattainable after how low we got. 2022 was a tough year, and seeing my portfolio continuously take a hit was mentally draining. I started investing in 2021 so I had no experience on how to navigate a bear market. There were moments where I got frustrated or sad but I kept DCAing into Bitcoin regardless. Got myself a hardware wallet after reading about victims of Mt. Gox and previous exchanges that went under (thankful for past me doing that) and hunkered down on buying every week regardless of whatever happened. Then FTX's collapse came near the end of the year and we saw Bitcoin drop to 16k. At that point I was looking at a purely down chart and my portfolio was hit even more. Thankfully I didn't put my crypto on anywhere like Celsius or FTX but seeing it down so much hurt. Is it over? Was this effort all for nothing?

I'm thankful I didn't give up. For the first time I'm able to see some unrealized profit from my Bitcoin buys last year. I know the battle for crypto is far from over and this market will keep us on our toes, hey, maybe this post will mark the local top and we go put in a new low.

241,I would like to start a company which stores commodities and tokenizes them. What lengths do you think I will have to go through to convince people its actually not a scam?,11uewtl,"List of commodities that might work:

A. Industrial Metals

1. Copper
2. Zinc
3. Tin
4. Aluminum
5. Nickel

B. Forest Products

1. Hardwood, board feet

C. Other

1. Rubber
2. Amber
3. Oil

I wouldn't do all the above, likely just specialize in one or two. Obviously shelf-life is a concern, so I like industrial metals and rubber. Oil too!

I think an important feature of these types of tokenized commodities is that they are 100% redeemable...in person (what do you think about that? Perhaps an appropriate redemption fee?)

Depending on the commodity type, an ERC20 token or ERC 721, would be appropriate. I like the way PAX Gold does it, as an erc-20 token, but if you want to redeem you need at least 400 PAXG to actually take possession. I think that if you held a tokenized barrel of oil and you wanted to take possession of it, you should be able to do it! Same for a bar of copper.

But lets get to the root issue, TRUST. How many scams? So many. I don't see how I can actually market this without encountering mountains of ""scam"" and ""sus"" comments. Short of Vitalik Buterin himself endorsing it, I think the juice is not worth the squeeze.

248,Why you're witnessing history with crypto like the internet and online shopping boom.,11tl7m4,"The parallel between crypto and the early stages of this is crazy. For starters, crypto started as an idea that is meant to protect people from bank failures, and although it can't fully do that yet, it is the idea that stands. That idea started with Btc. Then you have Ethereum and a host of other projects building massive ecosystems.

The crypto world has literally been through it all and is still going through it all, but even amidst all the chaos there is NFT markets that have started gaining some traction and a collectors desirability. I feel like crypto is gonna be that big catch all thing that'll connect the internet to the real world and services and so on like the payment systems will be connected to that like a massive interlinking web.

Some say this stuff is weird like the metaverse and all those other dystopian sounding ideas, but humans and their curiosity is infinite. Crypto is another massive page in our history that is being written right now. 

If I had to speculate I'd say that by 2030- 2040ish crypto will be fully integrated as many different ideas. And contrary to what everyone says about Btc being old and better stuff existing, it kinda has that Mcdonald's level branding and notoriety that will pretty much see it always exist in one form or another. I think we'll see games and crypto payments pretty much be the norm by that time. Btc will be accepted at most major stores like VISA and so on.

249,Crypto rallies as banks collapse and the St Louis Financial Stress index is yet to show signs of systemic financial system stress.,11u448p,"In the wake of the collapse of banks with large crypto exposures and crypto related services, along with the US federal government backstopping depositors crypto has rallied. In the last week Bitcoin has rallied 33%. Ethereum 21.86%

Banking and financial system stress are intrinsically linked to the use and value of cryptocurrencies. So what is the current health of the overall US and global financial system?

Oddly enough the St Louis Financial Stress Index, which has registered the Russian default and collapse of Long Term Capital Management, the dot com bust, September 11, 2001, obviously the 2008 financial crisis, the Greek credit crisis and concern over US financial situation involving rating agencies downgrades of US treasuries, a collapse in oil prices during 2015-16, and Covid-19 shutdowns have yet to register the recent turmoil in the banking sector.

It should be noted, however, the most recent update to the index today only accounts for conditions up until March 10th.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI4

This was developed after the 2008 financial crisis to gauge the amounts of systemic financial stress in the system. You can see it surge through the financial crisis, a rise during the Greek credit crisis and concerns over US government financial situation when treasuries were downgraded by rating agencies in 2011, being a bit above zero during the oil plunge in 2015-2016, and a surge during COVID -19 shutdowns promoting the fed to intervene in treasury markets.

So far it seems nothing about the latest banking issues are showing up in the index but I also just realized that the latest numbers are only up until March 10th. It will be interesting to see if there is a rise in the index next week.

*The STLFSI4 measures the degree of financial stress in the markets and is constructed from 18 weekly data series: seven interest rate series, six yield spreads and five other indicators. Each of these variables captures some aspect of financial stress. Accordingly, as the level of financial stress in the economy changes, the data series are likely to move together.*

*How to Interpret the Index: The average value of the index, which begins in late 1993, is designed to be zero. Thus, zero is viewed as representing normal financial market conditions. Values below zero suggest below-average financial market stress, while values above zero suggest above-average financial market stress.*

What will the index look like next week? And how will this index correlate work both on chain blockchain activity and prices of crypto related assets?",Justin534,13,3,0.59
250,"Reddit Vault vs Reddit Account, let's clear up some confusion",11tzina,"This write up may be a bit basic for a lot of you, but there seems to be MASS confusion about access to your reddit account vs access to your vault. 

You need a reddit account to create a vault. Your vault must be created in the mobile app.

When you create your vault, you need to SECURELY record 2 things:

1. Your vault password (you need this to access your vault via reddit on another device and work with items in your vault)

2. Your vault seed (you need this to import your vault into a wallet - more on that below).


**If an attacker gains access to your reddit account, unless they also have one of the pieces of information above, they DO NOT have access to your vault.**

Likewise, if an attacker has access to your vault seed, they have access to EVERYTHING in your vault, without having any access to your reddit account.

You can actually access your reddit vault outside of accessing your reddit account at all, by using a 3rd party wallet. (Metamask is super popular for this).

To access your vault in Metamask [follow this guide] (https://www.reddit.com/user/nanooverbtc/comments/wkfivm/instructions_to_add_arbitrum_novas_network_and/). 

Remember, your vault is on the blockchain and once setup, completely independent of your reddit account!

251,Can someone explain how agEUR got depegged?,11udwqs,"I am a tad confused and can't find anything that explains it in simple terms. The closes thing I could find was this explanation from [LammaRisk](https://twitter.com/LlamaRisk/status/1636460843381723136) on Twitter.

If I understand it correctly, a platform called Euler Finance was hacked and many different stabletoken pools were affected by it (somehow). One of which was agEUR. I am confused about why agEUR was so heavily impacted as opposed to the others (volume/liquidity) and how Eurler being hacked caused it.

So the question is, why did the price have such a massive drop? and why the price is still depegged?

So after a year of soul searching I’ve re-discovered what drew me to crypto in the first place: decentralisation. In particular, decentralised money.

So these past few months I’ve decided to take it back to basics and focus on sound money and coins that offer store of value. As such I’ll be focussing on BTC, LTC, and XMR.

258,How I've Been Investing in Crypto with Low Income.,11tti1b,"Greetings from Portugal. So a great part of us are in the age of 20-35, which means that with the actual inflation you either live with your parents or after you pay rent/house there isn't much money left. That's my case in portugal where I live with my girlfriend and rent is 50% of total house income.

That's why most of us became interested in cryptocurrencies, to have more financial stability.

With this, I believe it's it's helpful for a lot of us learning how to invest with low income. Even for those who have good money but don't wanna risk much.

In my own experience, **if I had saved money, I would feel less guilty about occasionally resuming bad habits I gave up, like smoking and eating fast food**, because these activities are no longer as detrimental to the economy as they once were, and since we are all human, we do deserve to spend money on fun activities. It's all because to that important investing year.

**Then what I did and still do is investing 10% of the money I have left before payday.**

One strategy I use is to **divide my investment into two parts: one for long-term holdings and one for short-term investments.** For my long-term holdings, I invest in well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. For my short-term investments, I seek out smaller, emerging cryptocurrencies with the potential for rapid growth for my short-term investments.

Anyways, over the last week or so, there has been a major decoupling of the price of crypto vs. the broader us fiat market; this is reflected in the price of (Crypto-with-E) specifically which has not been able to hold over 1700 for any considerable amount of time until the last day. To me, this is a HUGE bullish signal that there are NEW investors in the crypto market looking for new exposure vs the typical us fiat market.

261,Does Bitcoin weaken the Wests ability to fight enemies of freedom?,11ulyck,"One of the most valid criticisms of Bitcoin is that it reduces the ability of the Unite States to sanction enemies of the West e.g. the billions of dollars in accounts belonging to Russians confiscated last year after the invasion, and the kicking off of Russian banks from the SWIFT network.

Given we are now moving back to the war portion of the war-peace geopolitical cycle, using the dollar and the traditional monetary network to sanction enemies is going to become more important. Does Bitcoin weaken the West's position? It's obvious to most people that the West has a growing number of enemies whose values are antithetical to freedom - mainly Russia, China and Iran. Therefore the problem Im outlining is going to become more into focus.

262,Better fraud/scam protection is needed for easier mass adaptation of crypto.,11tymc1,"**Problem:**

One of the biggest issues I see (and also complaints) with crypto is that it is too easy to get scammed. I don’t think this happens disproportionately in crypto, since thousands of people are scammed every day on their debit cards. The real issue with crypto is unless you are paying for some kind of recovery service (that doesn’t happen to just be another scam) you are completely out of luck and lost all your money. 

**How it’s handled now:** 

Transaction fee’s and insurance really. When a claim is filed with a bank they attempt to reclaim the funds from the merchant, if they can’t the bank and visa (or whoever) split the cost. Visa covers this from the fees they charge on every transaction and the bank covers with overdraft and other maintenance fees. 

**How crypto can address this:**

Provide a similar service. Maybe not to the extent that visa or the banks can offer but what about a blockchain insurance company. They could set up a wallet to promote better security and offer transaction protection for a small additional fee. In the event your assets are lost due to fraud they either have on hand investigators to track down the funds or they outsource. Because they cover these costs they could offer 80% back (whether they can successfully recover or not) and use the 20% of the funds they do recover to help fund this pool. 

It definitely isn’t a perfect solution but I genuinely think there’s the basis for a good idea there. I’d love to hear other people’s thoughts!

**Edit:**

To add there are many options that do not involve centralizing (although I don’t see why a centralized option would be a bad thing). 

Things like two factor could be added as a wallet feature as well as built in black listed addresses where scams could be reported. You could also have one with customizable controls only allowing certain types of transactions or addresses. There’s definitely a lot of room for improvement between where we are and centralization.",robbie5643,84,6,0.69

One of them is looking at our monthly candle chart. Here we can see how we are just on the brink of having a 3rd consecutive green month. Obviously half of the month is still left but a close above $23.1k would guarantee it, which seem very likely currently.

Another very interesting fact is that if you just take ANY three consecutive green candles, you will realize that there has never been ‘just‘ three green months but always at least four green months.

This one here shows the 3-month candle which is barely used but can be a good indication for a rough trend overview. Here we are about to have our best 3-month candle since January 2021, the very beginning of the last bull market, which had a massive 100% gain in three months.

Remember all these media houseshave a process where articles have to pass through editors to be published in the first place. This piece would have had to have been approved already, such that it's someone else later on, likely external to Forbes, who had their feathers ruffled and demanded change.

I'm a ***complete moron*** for storing passwords and seed phrases for these accounts in Evernote here.

I'm a big fan of MOONs and had over 80k. I can see the hacker swapped all my Metamask assets into ETH where they are currently stored at this address - 0xe147a73e7d783166f791f10342a0122db80814c4

I'm absolutely devastated and not sure what to do.

Should I contact the FBI?

It appears the hacker could be from Germany based on the Evernote access logs. I could be wrong and both logins could be from a VPN. **\[UPDATE - These login attempts came from a TOR Exit Node as mentioned in the comments. The below, however, was the first attempt to connect to my Evernote. It was not a successful login.\]**

My biggest loss is the Rocketpool Node. I may have the first compromised node? He changed the withdrawl address to - 0x8294b95d303949699167f7579c9da49f6359d4ff. I can do nothing while he collects rewards. I believe I have some time here since nothing can be physcially withdrawn until the Shanghai Upgrade.

Lastly the Deadalus account had maybe 8k in ADA where it currently hits in the Hackers address here - addr1q8lee9tt64w6uwj9xwne2hnca8x8e2vg87prhl43uqdhdgk232uaxahskg735wxx28xwrhjj97fhphnyz3ppn3fjpygsywcdlv

269,Coinbase unlocking staked ETH April 2023,11ts5fi,"They just sent an email out about this:


The upcoming Ethereum upgrades (Shanghai and Capella Upgrades, collectively known as Shapella) are expected to complete in mid April 2023 and will enable staking withdrawals for the first time since ETH staking was introduced.

You can continue staking with no action required, and your assets will be secure during this upgrade period. If you’d like to withdraw your staked ETH, here’s what you need to know: 

We expect you'll be able to submit unstaking requests from your Coinbase account within 24 hours after the upgrade.

The time taken to process unstaking requests is determined by Ethereum protocol. We anticipate the Ethereum protocol will take weeks to months to process requests immediately following the upgrade, so you may need to remain patient during this time. You’ll be able to view an estimated processing period in your account.

For those seeking immediate liquidity, Coinbase offers a utility token, cbETH, that lets users unlock the value of their staked ETH.

With this upgrade, customers will become liable for taxes owed on any staked ETH (ETH2) or cbETH rewards earned leading up to the upgrade and after. 

When these upgrades are complete, Ethereum will have officially shifted from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, making it more secure, scalable, and energy-efficient.",BushyOreo,23,7,0.68

 \- Since margin/futures trading is more widespread now, part of the BTC profits will be used as well as margin on shorting BTC with leverage after the bullrun peak, taking part of the potential inflow of cash getting to altcoins.

 \- Altcoins rally will still be good, but a lot less than if there were no margin or futures trading, mostly since not everybody will get into margin/futures trading and still prefers the normal buy/sell of coins.

Let's see what the future reserves us.

271,Day Trading Can Be a Recipe for Disaster,11txo44,"
Cryptocurrency exchanges have become a popular destination for investors looking to make quick profits by day trading. But what most people don't realize is that these exchanges aren't always on your side.

In fact, many exchanges actually encourage day trading, even though studies have shown that 80% of day traders lose their money in the long run. Why? Because these exchanges make money on the volume of trades, not on the actual earnings of their users.

But history has proven time and time again that holding onto well-known investments is key to building long-term wealth. Instead of chasing quick profits through day trading, consider holding onto solid investments that have proven themselves over time.

keep in mind when you tempted to jump into day trading, remember that the odds are stacked against you. Instead, focus on building a strong portfolio of well-known investments that will stand the test of time.

even more than that when FTX crackdown happened it revealed that SBF had a long position that cannot lose. further more ""SBF used at least $4 billion in FTX customer funds to prop up his trading company, Alameda Research, as crypto prices fell earlier this year, according to CoinDesk.""",meowerguy,117,5,0.56
272,What Would Happen to Your Crypto If You Suddenly Passed Away?,11td9xa,"Long story short, I recently had a near-death traffic experience and feel fortunate to be alive and unharmed. While talking to a friend about what happened, I made a joke about buying a Powerball lottery ticket because of the luck, but it also silenced me because I realized if I did suddenly die, my crypto would just sit there in cold storage without ever being touched again. 

The seeds are drilled into my head and it’s also written down somewhere safe. However, I’m the only one who knows where that place is. Am I being paranoid about not leaving an envelope with my seeds in it for my family to receive if I were to pass away? Should I reach out to a lawyer about what to do with my crypto if I were to unexpectedly and suddenly pass away? 

Forgive me if I'm coming off as naive, I'm still learning new things about crypto even though I've held onto coins for several years now.

275,My Reasoning for Why the Banking Collapse Wasn’t Aimed at Crypto,11u5gcd,"The last couple of days articles about the banking collapse being caused to try and take out crypto have been all over this subreddit. There are a couple reasons that come to my mind right off the bat for why this would not be the case. 

Looking at the banks and how they were either structured or run by the executives higher interest rates were eventually going to kill them. Signature Bank for example was locked in to short term 3-6 year loans at extremely low rates compared to now. If we take a look at Credit Suisse the bank had not only under performed for over a decade but it has been paying billions in fines at the same time! 

Taking a look at this from another example is good old fashion heard mentality. Over the last week now rumors have run crazy resulting in regional banks, that have lower capital requirements, having billions in cash taken out. Well if all of your friends and family are doing it and putting their money in one of the big 4 then odds are you will to it’s just human nature. 

This final reason I saved for last because it is just plain sad but does anyone think Powell would be that smart? Causing a bank run which only cause crypto banks to fold would be challenging but theoretically could be done. Powell just isn’t that smart though to do that and to think he is just look at the state of the economy! The guy cares a lot about his reputation and legacy something that with this run is even further blown up compared to just a week ago. I hate to say it he just plain couldn’t pull that off if you are asking me.

276,"There are a bunch of people kicking themselves for not buying USDC for a massive payday, but many did exactly that with Terra-USD...",11sybx1,"There was clear uncertainty in the market when SVB collapsed. USDC depegged all the way down to about $0.87 at it lowest I believe. It then recovered to around $0.93-$0.96 and stood there for a good while. That was actually really interesting because the price drop represented fairly well the 7-8% loss of funds stuck in SVB.

But when it was depegged, there were for sure a bunch of people saying it was a sure-fire profit if you bought USDC. Some said quite the opposite. the thing is most of us on the sub were around when Terra collapsed and know very well the ridiculous bets some people made. Some bought on leverage when Terra fell to $0.70. Some took the bet all the way at $0.09-0.10 for a big payout. But it was a terrible decision for those people.

Yes, *technically*, you have a 50% chance of winning. *Fundamentally*, USDC still had 90% of its reserves intact. But fundamental and technicals don't always matter in a market of irrational traders. It only takes one trader to panic, another trader to see that trade lose their composure and sell, and yet another trader who wants to doubts themself as to why those two sold...and so on.

FRC is the 14th largest bank in the United States and it’s collapse would signal that SVB was not a lone actor, and there are number of banks that were using deposits on long term bonds that are now worth a whole lot less than they paid for them and is bringing their solvency into question if a second full on bank run were to occur.

The market is aware of the risk, and they have reacted appropriately and their stock has tanked as a result.

But that’s okay, because a number of banks have decided to [provide FRC with liquidity](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-banks-to-infuse-first-republic-with-30-billion-to-stabilize-troubled-lender-192748893.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-banks-to-infuse-first-republic-with-30-billion-to-stabilize-troubled-lender-192748893.html)) on uninsured consumer deposits so they are able to pay their customers in the event a bank run were to happen.

**Does this remind anyone of anything that happened in crypto over the last 6 months?**

CZ and Binance decide to sell FTT and tweets about it, the token crashes and because FTX holds most of its $$ in FTT FTX has no money to pay back deposits.

**A bank run happens on FTX.**

FTX collapses, crypto crashes and the entire crypto market and the stability of every exchange and all stablecoin come into question.

So what happens next?

The crypto community ask for proof of reserves, we want to know how much money is in the accounts and whether everything lines up with what exchanges and stable coins have been saying.

Rumours start to fly as we see exchanges sending money to each other, millions of dollars are being passed back and forth between exchanges and there are no reason given by the exchanges, just regular bookkeeping and accounting.

Eventually the news moves on and people forget about the scandal and the subsequent questionable transactions.

This is the exact same story, but on a much larger scale.
[Jamie Diamond, Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen]([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-the-30-billion-rescue-of-first-republic-bank-003752506.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-the-30-billion-rescue-of-first-republic-bank-003752506.html)) get on a call in a panic because they are worried about the liquidity of FRC. If FRC fails, the confidence of every “regional” bank is called into question, and even some of the large national banks will be a cause for concern.

They then come up with a plan to get **11 BANKS!** To contribute to the liquidity pool to help save FRC.

\- JP Morgan (JPM) **$5 billion**

\- Citi Group (C) **$5 billion**

\- Wells Fargo (WFC) **$5 billion**

\- Bank of America (BA) **$5 billion**

\- Goldman Sachs (GS) **$2.5 Billion**

\- Morgan Stanley (MS) **$2.5 Billion**

\- U.S. Bancorp (USB) **$1 billion**

\- Trust (TFC) **$1 billion**

\- PNC (PNC) **$1 billion**

\- State Street (STT) **$1 billion**

\- Bank of New York Mellon (BK) **$1 billion**

**This is the same scenario that the crypto exchanges went through, liquidity was gone, they kept each other afloat, only this is at a much larger scale. The only difference is that banks are heavily regulated by the fed, and are required to be more transparent with their actions so we know about it. Whereas crypto exchanges could do this behind the scenes making it mostly hearsay.**

I think the questions you should be asking are;

A) What is the **real** fallout going to be if FRC collapses, contagion etc into the banking systems and the banks that fund crypto

B) Why is the FED so involved and keen on saving these bad actors? What happens to interest rates and QT if it does, and how much liquidity will be pumped into the market to save the economy again?

C) How will crypto be affected  as a result?

D) Is the liquidity crisis actually over for crypto exchanges?

I'm sure there are many more to be asked, but it is something the crypto world needs to keep an eye on.

**tl;dr**: If FRC collapses, it could be the second large domino and could mean crazy things for the crypto market, but im not sure which direction it will go. If exchanges, stablecoins and reserves are not impacted by the collapse or contagion it could cause the value to skyrocket. If there are big players in the space impacted, it could result in a massive crash and failures of Stablecoins or Exchanges.",Tallfuck,24,1,0.52

280,Self-custody Vitalik propose (having guardians and using multisig) is not self-custody. It is basically a bank in all but name.,11uhph1,"When Vitalik advocated for self-custody I was all for it. Decentralisation, responsibility and self-custody over your crypto was one of our main goals. It is important to understand in crypto we and only we are responsible for our money and we should have all control. Only you and no one else can use your crypto. That's can be both advantage and disadvantage, cause it require you to be careful. But it can't be done otherwise, if someone can't take responsibility they should just stick to th banks and leave banks in full control over their own money. But that would be complete oppositiom of all ideals  of crypto.


Now when I hear Vitalik say that by self-custody he mean having guardians over your money and using multisig for your wallets I am confused as hell. Cause it is exact opposite of self-custody, it is centralization with little power over your money. Basically a bank in all but name or at least what teenagers  purchases are ( before age of 18 kids can have a card or make big purchases but parents are guardians and have control including revoking all transactions). It is not any self-custody.

I am fan of Vitalik, but doesn't mean everything he say or do is right. I also had mixed feelings about him trading shitcoins (even if he got them for free probably better was to just ignore them or burn than sell, he doesn't need money) or playing with USDC when it fell to $0.9, especially when so many of people in crypto look up to him as some authority and may try to do the same.  In regard of his opinion of self-custody I think the same and I am concerned why he do something harmful to the space. Did he already forgot the reason why he created Ethereum was centralisation he saw while playing WOW as  teenager?

If you use guardians or multisig to your own wallets you lose control, you can't just send crypto in or out, you need other people's approval. Even if they are your family would you let them control your life? Or maybe better make your guardian some random you don't know, your financial advisor,  guy from bank or your  lawyer... That would backfire easily especially after your death. Your family would tear each other apart fighting for approving  using multisig  to share your crypto. Not first time not last time when familes fight about money. At least when you have full control over your crypto you can give keys after your death to one person  divide it in way you like.

Remember it is not self-custody if you keep money or crypto in bank, exchange or give your keys to anyone else. Self-custody as name suggest is only when 1 person, the owner of crypto have keys and absolute control.",Nuewim,28,0,0.35
281,"[NO MOONS] Vitalik shares his thoughts on how to use Guardians, Multisig wallets (like Gnosis Safe), and Social Recovery wallets",11tks1t,"Vitalik just posted this to the Ethereum subreddit. It's a good read.

No Moons since I'm copying directly from it:

--------------------------

Multisig wallets (eg. [Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/)) are an easy and safe way to store funds, and can give you most of the key benefits of **self-custody** - namely, your funds not being subject to disappearing because a centralized entity that seemed trustworthy turns out not to be at all - without the risks of having to be personally responsible for your entire security setup. I use a multisig wallet personally to store the bulk of my funds, as does the Ethereum Foundation.

A close cousin of multisig wallets is [social recovery wallets](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html), where a single key can be used to sign transactions but if that key is lost, a group of keys held by other people can be used to recover the funds. Social recovery wallets are much easier than multisig wallets to use, especially with the rise of [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) account abstraction and upcoming wallets like [Soul Wallet](https://twitter.com/zengjiajun_eth/status/1636496326723768320) that will make the technology user-friendly. In general, once social recovery wallets become mature enough, my recommendation will be to use social recovery for hot wallets that store a small portion of a person or organization's funds, and multisigs for cold wallets that store a person or organizations's savings.

Both multisig wallets and social recovery wallets rely on a concept of **guardians**: a set of N addresses, typically held by other people, of which any M can approve an operation (eg. one could set N=6 and M=4). In the case of a multisig wallet, each transaction must be signed off on by M of the N guardians. In the case of a social recovery wallet, there is a single key that can sign transactions, but if that key is lost, M of the N guardians must sign a message to reset the key.

**Two key questions in using multisig wallets and social recovery wallets securely are: (i) whom do you choose as guardians, and (ii) what instructions do you give them?** This post will outline how I think about this issue. The ideas here should mostly apply equally to multisig and social recovery wallets being used to secure funds for individuals and for organizations.

### What do we want out of guardians?

* Minimize the chance that they lose their keys
* Minimize the chance that they collude to steal your money, or get coerced into doing so
* To the extent that the above two risks are unavoidable, the risk of each guardian should be maximally _uncorrelated_ - you want to minimize commonalities that risk situations that will disable or compromise too many of your guardians at the same time.

This answer is simple and short, but it guides all of the choices that I make with regard to guardians.

### It's okay for some of the guardians to be your own devices, but not too many

It makes natural sense to have at least one guardian be a wallet on one of your own devices - it doesn't reduce decentralization to do that, and after all, it _is_ your money. Once you go above one guardian controlled by yourself, however, you get into a tricky tradeoff: you get to trust other people less, but you're also concentrating more power into yourself, which can create a risk if you get hacked, coerced, or incapacitated or die.

My rule of thumb is that enough guardians should be controlled by other people that if you disappear there are enough other guardians left to recover your funds. That is, **you should control at least 1 guardian, and at most N-M guardians**. Also, each guardian should be on a separate device (laptop, phone, old phone, etc).

### Choose guardians who do not often talk to each other or ideally do not know each other

Ideally, the guardians should not know who each other are. This greatly reduces the risk that they collude, and furthermore there is _no good reason_ for them to know each other. If something happens to you, they will still be able to find each other, because there are obvious standard protocols that naturally come to people's minds in such a situation (eg. contact your family).

Also, you want to **minimize correlations between your guardians as much as possible**: don't choose two guardians who live in the same city (or ideally even the same country), or two guardians who use the same type of wallet, and have a balance between different operating systems.

### Guardians should ask a security question before approving an operation

When you ask a guardian to approve an operation for you (in a multisig, this would be any transaction, and in a social recovery wallet, this would be resetting your account's key), they should not simply say yes immediately. This would be a disaster for security: if someone hacks into your chat account, they could scan your messages, figure out who your guardians are, contact each of them and ask them to confirm, and thereby steal your funds.

My preferred protocol to avoid this is to instruct guardians to **ask a security question**. That is, when you ask for a confirmation on your operation, the guardian should ask you something that only the two of you and very few other people know (eg. ""the last time we met, what kind of food did we have?""), and only confirm the operation if you give the correct answer. A natural alternative is voice or video calls, but in the age of AI deepfakes this is weaker evidence than before, and so you may want to combine the voice/video call with asking some kind of security question.

### If you're doing ""degen"" stuff, make sure to have guardians who can respond quickly. Otherwise, this doesn't matter

If you're doing degen stuff with on-chain contracts, you may need to act quickly: pull money out if a contract gets a vulnerability, move money around if you are close to being liquidated, etc. If your needs include this, then you want to find guardians who can act quickly on short notice (and therefore also, guardians in different time zones, so enough guardians to complete a transaction are awake at all times) to protect your funds. If you do not do these kinds of things, however, then speed is not particularly important, and in fact may even be slightly harmful, because convincing people of the need to act urgently is a common social engineering tactic used by hackers and it can be good to have people who are by default mentally averse to that.

### Test each guardian at least once a year

Make a test operation at least once a year. Ideally, make two test operations each year, using half your guardians for one and the other half of your guardians for the other. This makes sure that your guardians haven't forgotten or lost their accounts.

### Advanced: privacy

One of the challenges with guardians today is that the tech does not yet exist to make it possible to protect your financial privacy from your guardians. However, this is a technical problem that can be solved technically: instead of guarding your account directly, the guardians guard a ""lockbox"" contract where the link between your account and the lockbox is hidden. Making the link stay hidden until a recovery needs to be made is pretty easy: for example, your account could have as a guardian a CREATE2 contract that only the lockbox can create. Making the link stay hidden _even after_ a recovery, however, requires more advanced ZK-SNARK tech. Hence, this is a problem that I expect will slowly be solved over the next few years.",Maleficent_Plankton,20,11,0.68

The website request a payment via Coinbase in many different coins. I though that this could be a scam, but to confirm it I sent 2,50 USD in MATIC that I had in an alternate account to prove it. I even got a recepit for it.

&#x200B;

Now, I think also the email that is on the bottom of the recepit is used to scam the users even more, because they will send an help request there, when they will not get the money on the account.  I didn't tried to write to the email.

I reported this to the Cointiply support and this was the asnwer:

283,I don't believe US banking regulators are trying to kill crypto. Here's why.,11tl7l4,"I've seen a number of posts now about how the Fed and FDIC are hostile towards crypto. But I have not seen any articles, statements, or regulatory actions that have convinced me this is true. Please post links to the reasons why you think this is true if you do.

What I have found, however, are a few misleading headlines and accusations that this is occurring. I know that the head of the SEC believes that many cryptocurrencies are securities. I would also suggest, not all, but there are many cryptocurrencies which meet the definition of a security in my mind. There are literal corporate bonds trading on blockchains right now. Which is awesome! And they are securities.

What I've also found is if you just read certain articles or headlines and take them at face value it could seem like the Fed, FDIC, and OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) are hostile to cryptocurrency. Most people have concluded this based on a joint statement issued by these regulators. Here's that statement:

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230223a1.pdf

If you read the first section of this statement you will read the following: 

*Banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation.*

I don't see anything hostile about this statement. I think the opposite.

The second section is titled ** Liquidity Risks Related to Certain Sources of Funding from Crypto-Asset-Related Entities**

Again I do not see anything hostile to crypto. It basically says crypto is volatile and risky. Deposits from cryptocurrency related customers might have abrupt inflows and outflows. If a bank holds reserves for a stablecoin and there are a large amount of redemptions that bank could see a large outflow of deposits.

The next section is titled **Effective Risk Management Practices**

This section basically just says this is how banks can manage these risks.

1. Analyze deposits from crypto related entities to better understand what dives the in or outflows of those customers, and identify which deposits might have unpredictable volatility.

2. Identify how interconnected those deposits are.

3. Stress test those deposits and have contingency plans if there are large outflows.

4. Make sure to do your due diligence on crypto related customers and understand that if they misrepresent their business or risks of the business there can be large outflows.

There is absolutely nothing I've seen in this statement that is hostile towards crypto. All it says is ""Hey banks!! Don't screw up again on another unregulated financial asset. Manage your risks!""

After 3AC, FTX, Celsius, Terra Luna/UST, Voyager, Blockfi, etc I think what would be wreckless is for financial regulators not to issue a statement like this.

Regulators are concerned about how much any bank exposes itself to crypto not IF they are exposed to crypto. After all the failures we've seen in the crypto space I can't blame them, can you?

I also realized I have no idea what the Comptroller of the Currency is and I still have no interest in finding out 🤷‍♂️

288,My opinion on bank crisis (why I think it is not related to crypto).,11u6t63,"I will try to explain it as short as I possibly can.
First of all, we all know that banks are literally detached with system and states (without a state, credits, fundings, and obviosly sistem itself-banks wont be able to operate). They are protected by law and state (they have legitimate power to chase us for our money obligations related to them-which is system related). They are privileged. In return of that, they have to listen everything that the state itself and government says. That is why money printing and laundering (as all of us are highly conscious they do) is allowed to them with state's eyes closed. System can make profit out of them and use it. They can cover their dirty money that way. I would call it ""legalised mafia work"".
That system is working that way many years back and it is not a secret. It had to break at some point, as we all are aware that crisis is worldwide and economics is in total destruction, inflation is literally highest in the room.
Crypto, on the other side is for my opinion on the completelly other track. Common attacking on it exists because people's eyes are opening and they can't lie us an hide from us like they used to be. People are waking up and realising that crypto is much bigger than they thought it would be and much more reliable and dependable than banks and stocking money in banks, so they decided to give it a try. 
So, why would government make the stocks of crypto go incredably up if they know that it is something that they can't control like any other thing and we know how much war-likely they are opened to crypto. Doing everything to sabotage it and convince people that crypto world is world of lies and thiefes, and not their. So why would they intentionally make the stocks go up? Makes no sence to me. They know we arent fools and that none would believe them in their ""good intentions."" Maybe they figured out that it is something much bigger then the system and now they try to find a way to get along with it ""without notice"" and to ""join it"" so they could make higher profit and control every platform or market.
But I still dont thing that the prices going up has to do anything with them directly. Makes no sense to make something you want to destroy (its value) more worthy. No conspiracy, just an interesting coincidence in timing.

Tuesday’s CPI data shows that J.Pow might just have to hike the fed rates yet another 50-75bps next week. We’ve all seen how the rising interest rates have strained banks with SVB’s recent failure (hence the bankruns and the crypto/gold pumps).

The way I see it, this could go one of two ways:

1. Rates get hiked (as they should): potentially more banks fail, and people find safe haven in crypto
2. J.Pow pulls the rug to save the rich: we fall into recession, crypto dumps, and fiat becomes even more worthless (and I don’t get to buy eggs again this year)

I know that losing the custody of the tokens is never good, but I would like to know what are the best ways to stake USDT.

Appart of the normal way where I could deposit on binance or coinbase and stake USDT direclty, I thought in (not sure if possible), to take a loan and using my USDT as collateral but instead of staking and lose the custody of the tokens get like ADA or other coin that we can delegate and never lose custody of it.

294,"Keys, keys, keys",11tdrxr,"I've always been confused about the different types of keys, mnemonics, addresses that one can have in crypto. Recently I've been educating myself on the topic. Here's a summary of the differences between these terms, along with the number of keys or addresses that can be generated from each one:

* **Seed phrase:** A string of words used to generate a master key. An unlimited number of accounts, private keys, public keys, and addresses can be generated from a single seed phrase.
* **Master key:** A top-level key derived from the seed phrase. An unlimited number of accounts, private keys, public keys, and addresses can be generated from a single master key.
* **Account key:** A key derived from the master key, used to generate a distinct set of private keys, public keys, and addresses for a specific account. An unlimited number of private keys, public keys, and addresses can be generated from a single account key.
* **Private key:** A secret key used to sign transactions and access cryptocurrency funds. A single private key corresponds to a single public key and a single cryptocurrency address.
* **Public key:** A key derived from a private key, used to receive cryptocurrency funds. A single public key corresponds to a single cryptocurrency address.
* **Address:** A unique identifier used to receive and send cryptocurrency funds. A single cryptocurrency address corresponds to a single public key and a single private key.

In summary, the seed phrase and master key can be used to generate an unlimited number of accounts, private keys, public keys, and addresses. Each account key can generate an unlimited number of private keys, public keys, and addresses. Each private key corresponds to a single public key and a single cryptocurrency address.

297,How much Bitcoin is really worth considering inflation?,11trmer,"**Hey fellow redditors,**

**As I saw news about FED's pumping $300B into US banks, and pushing BTC over 26k$, I was wondering, is that really true price of the BTC?**

**So, I took annual inflation report and did some math. If someone doesn't know, inflation is around 6%.**

**Assuming an inflation rate of 6% per year, we can use the following formula to calculate the real value of $26,000 today:** 

Real value = Nominal value / (1 + inflation rate)\^n

Where n is the number of years since the nominal value was measured.

Assuming the nominal value of $26,000 was measured one year ago, we can plug in the values:

Real value = $26,000 / (1 + 0.06)\^1 Real value = $24,528.30

**So the real value of $26,000 one year ago, adjusted for 6% inflation, is $24,528.30 today.**

**And if we want to convert this to the value of Bitcoin, we would need to look up the exchange rate of Bitcoin to the US dollar at the time the $26,000 nominal value was measured. Assuming the exchange rate was 1 BTC = $26,000, the real value of 1 BTC today would be:**

Real value of 1 BTC = $24,528.30 / $26,000 = 0.9442 BTC

**So if inflation was 6% and the nominal value of Bitcoin was $26,000 one year ago, the real value of Bitcoin today would be approximately 0.9442 BTC.**

I think this current scenario that we are seeing play out is more significant for crypto than many of us realise - this is the first time we are seeing a narrative form for the mainstream that traditional banking systems are not as safe as we have all been led to believe and that crypto, whilst still in its infancy is a real option for wealth storing instead of the banks.

299,How can governments destroy or limit the adoption of Bitcoin?,11tckia,"Let’s say you were the US government and you’e becoming ever more concerned with the growing influence of cryptocurrency and it’s bold claim that it will one day replace fiat. It is in your interest to persevere fiat and kill crypto. 

You also quickly realize that trying to shutdown all crypto projects is a fool’s errand as there are thousands of them in different buckets - defi, NFTs, stablecoins, etc. So you set out to make your job easier and destroy faith in crypto and the rest will fall. To do this, you decide to destroy or limit the influence of Bitcoin. If you can take down the original crypto, surely faith in everything else will vanish. 

What you (the government) have done so far:

Go after the crypto-friendly banks. Increase interest rates. This will indirectly cause bank runs. Seize the banks, reassure depositors will be made whole again but those pesky investors are on the hook for their loss. Slowly continue waging war on crypto-friendly banks. 

Future campaigns:

1. Monetary - Tax the hell out of crypto. 30% is for chumps. Raise it to 60-70% on crypto capital gains. And only do it for crypto, stocks are your friends. Software like TurboTax have already separated the two out for you nicely, the groundwork has already been laid. 

This will break the backs of crypto investors. Some won’t report their crypto profits (or losses, who are we kidding!). But if they’ve already reported their crypto activity in past years, we’ll they’re not so anonymous now. You have their wallet addresses. 

2. Access - shutdown crypto exchanges. For all of the talk of “decentralized”, let’s be honest most crypto users have their money on exchanges. Not you keys, not your coins. You won’t get those who have their assets on cold wallets, but those are in the minority. Also shutdown ledger sellers. That’ll make it hard for new users to have cold storages. 

The more technically competent crypto users will not be affected by this. But it will slow down or even freeze adoption since crypto adoption relies on the mass less technically savvy public to have easy interfaces to work with crypto. 

So there you have it. That’s what the government is doing or will probably do in the future to try to kill crypto. 

It is in our interest, those of us who want to see mass crypto adoption one day, to think of these possible roadblocks and try to find solutions for them.

I've never been a large player in this game but I had a few k worth of usd in it. My money wasn't spread on big guys btc, eth and so on. I had it fixed on one particular player. I won't disclose the name but it sits comfortably at 5000 rank on coinmarketcap now. Way away from public attention, lol.

Anyways, I figured that if I want to make a shot in here, I should aim for something rather cool and outstanding in the field. That was my main reason to shift my side money towards it.

And to be honest I am glad with my choice (atleast was glad...). Up until earlier this year  when I checked my MEW balance (my ether wallet) and saw zeros. My initial thought was that the coin went balistic towards the ground and reached zeroes and became useless piece of trash. As I got myself back to grip I inspected it closure since I knew that sometimes apps updates and show nonsenses but not this time.

My funds were sent to a newly created wallet (at this date it has 2 transactions - one in, one out). Then was sent to pancakeswap and swapped to other token and in some other currency got into this wallet ( 0x870CdF31020A7D10F604A41bA90b87A76F0a2903 ).

I don't wan't to disclose the invested project name, or my wallet name or any exact date since some of you will be quick to judge that the project was shite and so on, this post is not about that.

And I know that I will never recover the coins I had therefore f.ck this particuliar wallet owner. 

What I can do is to learn from this story and move on, probably put some money aside and atleast buy some of my original stake again before the bull season stars. 

A few more interesting aspects that I should mention - since 2022 october I started to get messages from facebook and twitter.

Facebook would message me once a month or so with a  

""Did you log in to Facebook from somewhere new?. It looks like someone tried to lon in to your account on 17 october at 13:14 using an unknown device"". 

I didn't pay attention since I am kinda nobody and no one should be interested in hacking to my social media account. 

 And from 2022 december I would get emails from twitter with captions like:

,,We noticed an attempt to log in to your account. ______ that seems suspicious. Was this you?""

Suspicious login details would be: Springfield, Safari on Iphone.


First of all, I am from Europe. Secondly, I hate iphones. 

During the period from 2022 october till 2023 january I kinda ignored all the messages thinking that the failed attempts proves that these people don't know my passwords and cannot do anything at all. Yet the story laters shows differents things.

4,ETH and Decepticons in OK? - P1,11ajww6,"Hey there fellow investors, I've got some exciting news to share with you! As you all know, Ethereum is a leading blockchain platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications and smart contracts. But what you might not know is that Ethereum is currently undergoing a major upgrade, known as the ""Merge"", which is set to revolutionize the world of blockchain.

The Merge is a complex process that involves the merging of two different Ethereum chains, the Proof-of-Work (PoW) and the Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The PoW chain is currently the backbone of Ethereum, where miners compete to validate transactions and earn ETH as a reward. However, the PoW system is notorious for its high energy consumption and slow transaction processing times.

That's where the PoS chain comes in. The PoS chain is designed to be more energy-efficient and faster, as it relies on validators instead of miners to validate transactions. By merging the two chains, the new Ethereum will combine the strengths of both systems and become a more efficient and scalable platform for decentralized applications.

But why stop there? What if we take this to the next level and create a Decepticon from Ethereum? I'd like to hear you out, folks. Ethereum's ability to process smart contracts and decentralized applications is similar to a Transformer's ability to transform and adapt to different situations. And just like a Decepticon that can merge into one super-robot, Ethereum's Merge will create a more powerful and unified blockchain platform.

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""That all sounds great, but what about the technical details?"" Well, here's the thing. The Merge is a complex process that involves introducing new software, new hardware, and a complete overhaul of the Ethereum blockchain. This means that the new Ethereum will be faster, more efficient, and more secure than ever before.

From a financial perspective, this is great news for investors. With the Merge, Ethereum's scalability and efficiency will significantly improve, which means that it can handle more transactions and attract more developers to build on top of it. This could potentially lead to a surge in demand for ETH, which could drive up its price in the long run.

But let's not get too ahead of ourselves. The Merge is still in progress, and it's important to remember that investing in cryptocurrency always comes with risks. That being said, the potential benefits of the Merge make it an exciting time to be an Ethereum investor.

In conclusion, the Merge is a major milestone for Ethereum, which can potentially take the blockchain to new heights. Whether you're a seasoned investor or just starting out, it's worth keeping an eye on Ethereum and its progress towards becoming the ultimate Decepticon

Once the Merge was complete, Ethereum and its associated technologies became integrated with a powerful and intelligent Decepticon. The new entity, which became known as ""Ethercon"", quickly began to dominate the crypto landscape with its superior technology and unparalleled capabilities.

Ethercon continued to evolve and improve as time passed, incorporating the latest advancements in AI and blockchain technology. It quickly gained a reputation as the most powerful and advanced crypto entity in existence, and many investors flocked to it in droves.

As Ethercon's influence grew, it set its sights on a new target: the state of Oklahoma. Using its superior technology and strategic planning, Ethercon launched a series of coordinated attacks on key infrastructure targets throughout the state, gradually weakening its defences and paving the way for a full-scale invasion.

Despite the best efforts of Oklahoma's military forces, they were no match for the advanced weaponry and tactics employed by Ethercon. Within a matter of weeks, the Decepticon had successfully conquered the state, establishing a new seat of power for its burgeoning empire.

8,"Liquid staking, Interchain Security and the fight against centralization and censorship on the Cosmos Hub",11aiinb,"The Cosmos Hub is rapidly gaining a centralization problem. Of the 196 million ATOM’s bonded, the top 10 validators hold 39% of the stake (rounded down, they technically hold more tokens than this). That means, based on Tendermint consensus, in order to begin censoring transactions on the blockchain, a third party just needs to buy or lawfully acquire these specific validators, and they will be able to censor the chain with, to my knowledge, no meaningful recourse by the chain itself.

*Can we just redelegate?*

Not really, if it were that easy, people would hopefully be doing that now, instead of waiting for the network to be censored.

The second answer to this question is also, not really. Liquid staking is going to be a huge contributor to centralized stake on the Hub. Liquid staking providers have to mitigate the risk of a validator, that is holding their protocols stake, getting jailed and slashed. Therefore, they mitigate this risk with whitelisting the validators who hold their stake. ***I couldn’t find the actual validator whitelist for Stride, which I feel should be easily disclosed and should be easily obtained.*** However, I would imagine, that disclosed list would include the main validators being the ones I have listed in this post. (*LS providers should willingly disclose their whitelist, and make it easy for us as delegators to help mitigate centralization of stake by doing so. If anyone knows of this white list of validators, please share a link to it in the comments, so I can edit it into this post.*) 

This creates a massive risk, and we as a network need to mitigate this risk. One way could be through taxing all transactions that go to the Stride zone, or any other liquid staking zone, and redistributing those funds either to the treasury, to the lower bound of validators and their delegators or a mixture of these two redistribution methods. 

*Why does ICS play into this centralization risk?*

When a new sovereign chain is added into ICS, a new node is spun up, to run this chain by every validator. If these validators fail to govern these new nodes properly, they get jailed and/or slashed. Therefore, those who wish to not be jailed or slashed, must trust the validator. This risk compounds even heavier for liquid staking providers.

We as human beings, tend to trust the “smart money”. The optics on the Hub say that these validators that I have listed are the Validators trusted by the “smart money” delegators. This leads to new, uneducated delegators blindly delegating to these validators, ever increasing the stake of the validators listed above. This problem runs deep, and we have to be intentional as an educated community, to change the current path we’re on. 

*Any potential solutions?*

Yes, there are a few. Some radical and some just take intent by the community to do the right thing for the network. 

1. DELEGATE OUTSIDE OF THESE VALDIDATORS AND EVEN BETTER, OUTSIDE OF THE TOP 10. 

Sorry for yelling, but this is the easiest way to protect the Hub. Research some of the validators out of the top 10, read their tweets, medium articles, see if they interact with the community. Gain trust in them. Then, after that, redelegate to them. 

Names I trust: 

Golden Ratio, B-Harvest, Stakecito, Notional, Informal Systems, Citadel.one, Iqlusion, Strange-love Ventures, Forbole, Frens Validator, Smart Nodes, Polkachu, Lavender.Five.Nodes, Whisper Node, Oni, Cros-nest, Stake Systems, Chill Validation, Don Cryptonium, Bro_N_Bro, Coinhall.org, P2P, Chorus One, Cosmic Validator, Spark IBC, Architect Nodes. 

If I missed some that YOU, as a delegator trust, please comment down them down below. If you read this list and have ANY stake in a top 10 validator, please leave Reddit, take the time right now to redelegate some of your stake and then you can come back and read the remainder of the post. Please, do not read the remaining, if you have not redelegated, this is the #1 most important thing you as a delegator can do for the network. Even if it’s only 1 ATOM, get it out of the top 10. 

2. We need to constantly educate, push against misinformation and make your main crypto priority, educating on the importance of intentional delegation, private key management, liquid staking risk and other items that need addressed. People don’t understand the centralization risks in crypto. So we have to make it an emergency, every day, for the rest of eternity. If the people don’t understand proper decentralization and censorship resistance, the blockchain industry will fail and simply become a more efficient and effective arm of the current system  and internet we have today. But we don’t want that, we want freedom and Liberty on the internet, so let’s educate relentlessly. 

***If you talk crypto, you better include decentralization, it’s importance and why censorship resistance on the internet is both important **and** attainable.***

*Conclusion*

I hope this helped to elaborate on the importance of intentional delegation, and the risks associated with ICS and Liquid Staking. 

I’m a massive bull on Cosmos and the IBC. I also don’t want to seem like I’m
being negative on ICS and Liquid Staking, I’m quite positive about what they will do to our ecosystem. These are amazing innovations and add great functionality to the Hub and to the ecosystem. However, there will ALWAYS be new risks, with every innovation. Blockchains, like life, are full of trade offs. So we must mitigate these trade offs anywhere possible, and I hope this post inspired you to take initiative. 

Thanks 

*EDIT: I should also add, I am an amateur in blockchain and Cosmos, although I’ve spent a long time the past few years trying to understand different consensus models and their decentralization and the censorship resistance that can come from these models. I am not an expert and my information may be countered by someone with more understanding of this subject.

11,"After yesterday's outage, 25 out of 100 total Polygon validators are about to lose their staking status. Polygon rushed a governance proposal to keep validator SLA requirements at a reduced 95% performance to save them. They're also exploring replacing their blockchain protocol.",11ahkzw,"A 25 out of 100 total Polygon validators are about to lose their staking status due to the outages yesterday. In additional, the co-founder of Polygon stated that they are exploring replacing their entire [Bor/Heimdall blockchain protocol with a single-blockchain solution](https://twitter.com/mihailobjelic/status/1628926312076423170).

**Yesterday after laying off 20% of its staff, several Polygon validators experienced sync issues, which then lead to giant cascade of outages for most validators**. They ended up having to resync, often up to 12-24 hours of blocks. The [block explorer outage](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/22/polygon-blockchain-suffers-apparent-outage/) was a result of this cascade. The Polygon team has yet to announce the root cause of the issue, but it was attributed to a [157-block reorg](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/22/polygon-blockchain-suffers-apparent-outage/). Their validators are able to correct for a 128-block reorg, but not anything higher. The reason for the reorg was [a bug between their Bor and Heimdall layers](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/157-block-reorg-at-block-height-39599624/11388).

Back in Aug 2022, there was a governance proposal, [PIP-4](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-4-validator-performance-management/9956), to move towards permissionless validation.

> ""In its current state, the PoS validator network is not entirely permissionless in that the previously-selected set of validators has largely persisted since testnet.""

The proposal added an SLA requirement that 95% of median average of last 700 checkpoints are signed by the validator. If the validator fails to meet the SLA, they have another 700 checkpoints to meet it. Otherwise, they get removed from staking. After 2 months, the SLA would increase from 95% to 98%.

**Due to this rule and the validator missing checkpoints yesterday, 25 out of 100 validators would get kicked off staking.**

Thus, they're now voting to reduce the SLA back down to 95% in [PIP-9](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-9-performance-benchmark-adjustment/11387). **Lowering the SLA would save 18-23 of them from getting unstaked. 2 of them would be unstaked no matter the vote since they're below the 95% SLA threshold.**

So there are 3 big findings from yesterday's validator outage:

1. Massive > 32-blocks reorgs can still happen (even after PIP-5 reduced most them from 128 to 32 with the sprintLength update). Many validator clients cannot automatically correct for them.
1. The SLA threshold has been reduced again
1. The Polygon team is investigating eliminating the reorg issues permanently by replacing their dual-layer block proposer/consensus blockchain protocol with a single-layer consensus protocol.

Obviously, this was extremely  messy for Polygon.

**Update**: PIP-9 passed, so 18 of those validators are saved. Another 5 of them remain in Grace period 1 and might survive if they recover before the next 700 checkpoints. 2 will be removed.

I see some of you comparing this to a Solana outage. It's not equivalent. This was a validator outage, but the network itself stayed up aside from the reorg.",Maleficent_Plankton,100,64,0.9

13,Update on Earning by Providing Liquidity on SushiSwap - Must stake your LP,11agu34,"Our [r/cc](https://www.reddit.com/r/cc/) mods were contacted by the SushiSwap team. They proposed [this approach](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VHZwaa_IqyxHo1FT7xtMs6tkWWDAHFyrmNow5rO8lo0/edit) which would allow liquidity providers to gain extra MOONs in while also gaining SUSHI by staking your liquidity provider tokens.

I realize that last part sounds complicated but if you are already providing liquidity then staking your Liquidity Provider tokens is just one step away (instructions below).

Once your LP tokens are staked you start earning SUSHI immediately and can un-stake the LP tokens to collect your SUSHI anytime. Note that SUSHI is worth more than $1 currently so this is decent dual earning. Int he near future you will also MOON coming in with your SUSHI.

Remember to look into impermanent loss and how pools work before putting precious tokens into the mix. For example, the recent price shift in MOONs caused me to suddenly have more than 1,000 less than I put in because the pool shifted toward a higher balance of ETH as MOON went up in price. If I pull out my liquidity now I lose those MOONs forever.

How do I stake my LP tokens? There are many guides now for how to add liquidity and I noticed most don't explain this last part which will be required for earning MOONs.

1. Go [here](https://www.sushi.com/earn/arb-nova:0xd6c821b282531868721b41badca1f1ce471f43c5)
2. Your liquidity balance should be shown under ""unstaked position""
3. Click ""deposit""
4. Expand ""stake liquidity"" and click ""max""
5. Submit/confirm - watch as your Sushi total starts to go up back at the first page - you are earning SUSHI rewards and can ""claim"" them any time or unstake to claim and get your liquidity tokens back.

16,The MA 1000: Regression to the Mean and What it Means for BTC,11adnzl,"TLDR at the bottom

&#x200B;

Hi all this is my first TA post and I'm going to take a different approach from my usual shitposting and actually contribute something meaningful to this sub. This post is going to walk you through the Moving Average of 1000 days , regression to the mean, as well as both historical data and present day data. This isn't definitive and like in all statistics or journal publications that use statistics, past data is not a reflection of future outcomes. Replication of results doesn't always happen in the sciences, and I'd like to especially emphasize that it doesn't always happen in the trading world. Especially when we'll be comparing across trading worlds (traditional stock market to Crypto).  In other words, this is not financial advice but more of a fun overview using the available data. I'll try to keep it as simple as I can and cite sources where appropriate.

&#x200B;

First things first lets get some definitions and concepts out of the way, as well as preemptively answer any questions you may have:

&#x200B;

* **The Moving Average**: The MA is a stock indicator commonly used in technical analysis, used to help smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The number that follows MA denotes how many days is being used to calculate the average at any point where the line appears. MAs may be plotted on either daily or weekly charts, and depending on the MA you use you may get different stories. For the purposes of this writeup, we'll be using the MA 1000

&#x200B;

* In our TA we are going to be focusing on 3 trend lines. The **MA 50, 200, and 1000**. The MA 50 and 200 are  well established trendlines in the world of trading, and we can use them so see certain patterns such golden and death crosses. If in the instance that the 50 day MA crosses the 200 in an upwards direction that is called a golden cross and usually signifies the start of  a bull run or market. The opposite is true for when the MA 50 crosses the MA 200 in a downwards direction. This is called a death cross and usually signifies the end of a bull run market. We'll be seeing these pop up in the charts, though the main thing to pay attention to here is the MA 1000.

**◦**  MA 50 in red

**◦**  MA 200 in yellow

**◦**  MA 1000 in blue

* **So why are we using the MA 1000?** This is where regression to the mean comes in. The MA 1000 is not commonly talked about but is  an important trendline to consider in the greater picture of things. It rarely comes up because it rarely needs to be brought up. You can think of the MA 1000 as **not** ""the"" baseline but **a** baseline. Also, the more data points you have to inform a mean/average, the more reliable you can consider it. You may then ask why not the MA 2000? The reason is because you have to stop at a certain point, you simply can't collect all the data available. There is also the central limit theorem which you can test [here](https://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/index.html). Basically, at a certain point things will revolve around  the mean and rarely deviate too far from it for too long. For our purposes, we can think of the MA 1000 as an approximate of the mean.
* **Regression to the mean**: In statistics, regression to the mean is when extreme events often regress back to the average. In trading, this is often called a correction. What we're going to see are not only corrections, but also over-corrections.
* Why use traditional stocks to compare price movement in crypto? The reason boils down to data. There is simply more data to rely on in traditional stocks that spans over a long period of time than there is in crypto. for this writeup, I'll be using the **Dow Jones Industrial Average** as it has a wealth of data to examine and rely on. An MA 1000 is simply not available for BTC on the weekly chart, it is however available on the daily chart. We will see similar price movement patterns play out across these 2 charts. Also, if we can understand how the mean plays a role in 1 popular asset class, it can be used to understand how it might play a role in another asset class.

&#x200B;

Ok so lets get on with the TA. The MA 1000 is the mean, and everything revolves around it. Prices are attracted to the mean like a magnet. However that doesn't mean that prices will stick to the mean. Also, we rarely cross too far below the mean in the case of the MA 1000. In the picture below,  we can see that over a long period of time, the price reverts back to the mean and then bounces off. This is however not true when it is a time of crises. When crises hit, we go below the MA 1000. On daily chart, you can see that the price dips below the MA 1000 during the 2008 housing crash, as well when covid and lockdowns hit. However they recovered quickly after that point.

&#x200B;

On the weekly chart however, we can see that the MA 1000 acts as the bottom for the 2008 housing crash, and the covid crash doesn't touch the MA 1000

Lets take a look at another crises: The Great Depression

&#x200B;

On the daily chart we can see that in the beginning of the crash, the MA 1000 acts as baseline where prices bounced off the MA 1000. However, it does eventually cross below. In this case it stayed below the MA 1000 for approximately 4 years, and then oscillates along that line until the end of WW2.

&#x200B;

Daily DJI - Great Depression

https://preview.redd.it/hzexca0my0ka1.png?width=2598&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d5fb2e2ad4a5ec997da0b7d4ffa48cfba5a0a881

&#x200B;

On the weekly chart we can see that the great depression does indeed cross the MA 1000 however remains there for a longer period of time (about 5 years). However, we are again seeing it oscillate along the MA 1000 line.

&#x200B;

Weekly DJI - Great Depression

https://preview.redd.it/9il5e7doy0ka1.png?width=1509&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b66f4c76ac3eb164eec6fcf24da34cbfbccbeceb

What this is all coming together to say is that prices don't like to deviate from the mean too much without correcting (or overcorrecting \[going below MA 1000\]) for it. This also relies on the assumption that the economic environment can support drastic deviations from the mean for sustained periods of time (see prices skyrocket once WW2 ends into economic prosperity).

&#x200B;

Ok that was a lot of justification for the use of the MA 1000 in both good economic times as well as economic crises. So what is this doing on a cryptocurrency sub? Lets have a look at BTC's MA 1000 on the daily chart.

What we can see is that we are currently well below the MA 1000 on the daily chart. Assuming the past data indicates that prices do not like to deviate too far from the mean for too long, it may be said that we are indeed regressing back to the mean.

&#x200B;

Daily BTC  - Present Day (no sh!t)

https://preview.redd.it/rvnoqor231ka1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c85461d700be488466b803a199735f881ea00f5f

&#x200B;

Unfortunately the MA 1000 is not available for BTC's weekly chart (yet). So for the time being this means that we do not know where BTC's mean when considering the weekly chart.

&#x200B;

Note: This does not mean this is the beginning of a bull market. This means that we are correcting for an overcorrection. We will likely go on a bull rally as we regress back to the mean, however that doesn't mean it is the start of a bull market (rallies  ≠ market).

&#x200B;

Ok that was a lot. Here is the conclusion/TLDR;

The MA 1000 is a good indicator for the mean. When prices deviate too far from it they like to regress back towards it. This is especially true in times of economic crises, though different lenses need to be applied for different levels of magnitude/severity of the crises. When things are bad, use the MA 1000 on the daily chart. When things are **really** bad, use the MA 1000 on the weekly chart. BTC is showing signs of regressing back towards the mean. It may do so through a bull rally, but that does not mean we are in a bull market.",superduperdude92,29,14,0.78
17,Bitcoin is up 133% from five years ago - don't be a perma bear and don't sell to buy back lower,11adl16,"Five years ago today, Bitcoin closed (if that's even a thing) around $10,000.

I opened a coin base account and currently have a little BTC in there.  I rarely do any transactions so it kinda just sits there.

Recently I got an email from ""metamask inc"" saying that ""some wallets may require a manual upgrade"" and that if I dont upgrade I will ""lose all of my cryptocurrency""

Of course I didn't click on the link.

I have no idea who meta mask is or what they do.  I've never signed up with them and have no history with them in any way.

Can I ignore this email?  Is this legit in anyway?

If you get an email from any company really especially crypto, you should always check the e-mail from it being sent, and never click on a link or call a number in the email.

Edit: Also another good tip  is don't even open these emails. I don't think many people know this, but there is options for the email sender to know if you opened an email or not, so if you don't open it, the sender could be less likely to send you more. If you hover over the email without opening it, you can see who it came from.

24,CoinMarketCap APP randomly changing,11ab3c9,"Hello. Many of us use the CoinMarketCap app to track our purchases and average prices of the crypto we hold. In my case, everything is fine, the application is nice, clear, intuitive except for one thing. 

I've been noticing it for a long time, about a year, for example. I record there the purchase of 0.055 BTC for €100, but after a while, even if I don't set anything manually, it turns out that I bought the same 0.055BTC for €104 or €100.80 or 101,50€ etc… So, it sometimes randomly changes my total average price. For example, yesterday I had €24,590, today I have an average of €25,050 and I didn't buy anything in between, it just changed. 

One of my friends who I know personally has the same problem, but we can't figure out what could be causing it. I would like to stay with this app, but if it continues like this, I will try something else. I’m using it on Iphone if this is important. 

Does anyone have experience with this? Does this happen to you too? Or what other application would you recommend?",Elrondarius,17,8,0.76

Heard of dookie dash? The crypto video game released by yuga labs? Its really not impressive from a gaming standpoint, but a fortnight pro gamer who holds the high score won a 1/1 nft that was a key lodged in a monkeys butt hole. No one knows what it does, the utility has not been revealed.

That didn't stop the United Planets Dao at Pixel Vault from aping in a bid at 690 eth to acquire the key.  The winner Mongraal just needs to accept the weth offer on opensea and he will cash in on a massive payout for grinding on an extremely basic video game. He has 3 days to accept. Bonkers!

26,MOONs are boosting crypto learning curve that leads to mass adoption!,11aap4q,"Hi there fellow moonshiners!

I have some news for you if you didn't know already. MOON distribution among us folks here who post all day is getting us closer to mass crypto adoption and here's how and why, even if it may seem Aerospace Engineering stuff for some.

**The newb & CEX'es**

First of all, i was a complete newb in regards to whatever it was outside an Centralised Exchange! I had no notions and knowledge on how to actually move my funds elsewhere except buy and sell them on the same exchange. Let me tell you that thing is lvl 1 stuff.

This year i evolved and learned how to use a hardware wallet after multiple centralised exchanges dropping like flies. I learned how to move cryptos & tokens to the correct adresses and how to manage ""gas fees"". Most importantly i've secured myself from mostly all risks involved with a CEX. I am my own bank so i strongly suggest you do the same. 

**My own bank**

If Hardware wallet was lvl 2 crypto science, here i went to fell the tip of the iceberg, the what i call for me, level 3, connecting metamask to different chains that share the same adress and bridging funds between layers and also swapping stuff.

**Aerospace Engineering lessons**

It took me no less than 1 day of full research when i found out i had a few dozen of MOONS in my vault. I learned quickly i can make a good buck by selling them BUT here is where the fun started. Your Reddit Vault is basically a kind of wallet based on Arbitrum Nova layer 2 of Ethereum which holds MOON token issued by /r Cryptocurrency. I had no clue about this until i figured i couldn't send MOONS to a normal ETH adress without having some ETH for ""gas fees"". So, having no ""button"" to add eth for gas fees i found out that you need to connect your Reddit Vault Wallet to metamask by using your 12 word seedphrase. After that i had to find and add both Arbitrum One and Nova chains to the Ethereum Mainet adress of Reddit Vault that i just connected. After doing that stuff i needed to send some ETH from an Exchange or Hardware wallet to the ETH mainnet. Then i just found out about the huge ETH fees for a 20$ transaction. Took me about 3$ after setting the lowest GWEI. Then i found out that you can check GWEI oportunities on [Txstreet.com](https://Txstreet.com) and minimise the fees of sending ethereum. Soon after that i found out that to be able to send the ETH arrived in my ETH Mainnet (metamask) i coudn't just send it between chains without a ""bridge"" so i went to bridge to arbitrum website and tried to swap ETH from Mainet to Arbitrum Nova, where i need the ETH for gas fees. When i reached that point i just found that i needed another 8$ worth of ETH to be able to send the rest. After playing abit with GWEI price, my TX was pending forever, i accelerated it, didnt work, so i canceled. That cancel alone took another 2$. I was left with around 7-8$ out of 20$ with all the fees that ETH took away from me just to send ETH for GAS FEES! ... At that point i felt like giving up. I waited 15 min for ETH gas fees to arrive from ETH Mainnet to Arbitrum Nova next to ""MOON"" Token. Oh yea.. i also had to import MOON token to show up in metamask. 

&#x200B;

After every piece of this puzzle was set i could finally send MOON tokens to [Gate.io](https://Gate.io) (exchange) to sell for USDT and send it to my main exchange tied to the bank. But first i had to wait another hour for them to arrive and 15 minutes for the moons to be able to sell on limit order. 

**The Relief**

A tideous, rocket science task that will not be for many but surely this thought me the first most important steps of level 3 crypto science. This is the dark web of things in crypto, you either get it and try to pay attention to every little detail or your money gone 4 ever. This might have been a tutorial aswell for some of you that don't know what is the procedure. Feel free to ask, i can help you in the comments section. 

Last, MOONs are the best incentive you can get by just simply making posting good stuff that people love. It's the monetization of crypto, sort of like Youtube but ad-free. Those hard to learn procedures will toughen you and make you live and breathe crypto in it's fullest. You will love it.

&#x200B;

***TL;DR: Reddit Vault's MOON tokens are the best sort of incetives to make people learn the deepest parts of crypto and introduce them to the actual utility of crypto: blockchain transactions and many more. You get paid by just posting stuff here, but to be able to get your hands on the gold you need to pass a pretty difficult test.***",HiddenknifeX,79,15,0.64

 \*Fetch.ai (FET)  
 \*Artificial Liquid Intelligence (ALI)  
 \*Vectorspace AI (VXV)

To be honest, I never knew anything about AI projects until recently, chat GPT to be precise. The hypes on these projects seem to be building, perhaps they will be worth something in future. We do know that the future of AI and machine learning is growing extremely fast with lots of advancements made every year.

28,A discussion - could Reddit Moons be considered a security by the SEC?,11a9afo,"We’ve seen the recent SEC enforcement actions against Kraken’s staking, stablecoins such as Binance’s BUSD (which has caused it to stop being issued by Paxos and billions of dollars to flow out of the coin), not to mention the ongoing case against XRP. Could this sort of action be done against Moons? It depends on whether the SEC could view them as an unregistered security.


Let’s define a security. As a layperson with an interest in crypto, not a financial professional, I’ll do my best: there’s something called the Howey test that helps determine what counts as a security. “Under the Howey Test, a transaction qualifies as a security if it involves the following four elements: 
1. An investment of money
2. In a common enterprise
3. A reasonable expectation of profit
4. Derived from the efforts of others”
[source](https://www.embroker.com/blog/what-is-the-howey-test-does-crypto-pass/#what_is_the_howey_test)


For a crypto to qualify as a security (and in the SEC’s eyes, an unregistered security, which opens it up to their enforcement), it would have to meet **all 4** of the above criteria. A clear **no** would be Bitcoin: there’s no overall owner/distributor, and no profits are assured. (And if you’re like me buying the top, losses are expected). The SEC has determined most ICOs to be a **yes**, with more than half their 2022 lawsuits targeted at ICOs. Especially targeted by the SEC as unregistered securities are coins/tokens that raise funds via their own tokens to further develop their own coin/product. 


Where do Moons fit in to this? They’re freely given, so probably don’t meet criteria #1. That said, they’re on main net now and can be purchased (and sold) on exchanges. So that could loosely be interpreted as meeting Howey #1. And #2 also, since they’re issued initially from Reddit, not a decentralized source. #3  - well, Moons are Reddit’s Community Points, designed and marketed as a governance token, which strongly makes the case that they’re *not* securities as there’s no advertised nor expressed expectation to profit from Moons. #4 is about whether the profit from an investment is outside of an investor’s control. Since Moons already aren’t being given with a reasonable expectation of a profit, I’d say this one doesn’t apply. 


So taking it all together - it seems like currently Moons don’t pass the Howey test, so they don’t qualify as a security and shouldn’t seem likely to face the wrath of the SEC. **Woohoo!** That said, things can change. If Reddit started selling Moons directly, or even accepting them as payments, that could change some of the above answers. And who knows if SEC will decide to change what rules they apply to who.

(Original post got removed immediately due to too many Moons posts in top 50)

**TLDR;** Reddit Moons don’t currently seem to pass the Howey test - seemingly not a security at the moment and hopefully not in the SEC crosshairs!",bingorunner,104,21,0.72
29,"Even short-term holders are holding onto their assets for longer than usually right now, indicating that even they expect the market to go up further.",11a8xcy,"Generally we always seem to be associating short-term holders with people that buy the asset and quickly sell it as they have no believe in any kind of a long-term value and are often very bearish towards the assets, hence the name short-term holder. This may not be true at all as short-term holders are present even in bull markets and that often in en even larger amount.

One on-chain datapoint of short-term holders that distinguishes bull market from bear market is the so-called “Dormancy“, which is the holding period short-term holders hold onto their coins on an average. Yes, even short-term holders can hold for a longer period or shorter one.

* STH  (short-term holder) holding for a short period = bear market as the depressing price movements motivate for a quicker sale.

30,BTC/USDT: BTC Volatility Remains Under Control as Wall Street Panics,11a8v7u,"• The volatility of BTC has surprised traders by remaining relatively stable over the past few months.

• Indicators of stock market volatility on the other hand have been reaching yearly highs.

• Some analysts think it could be an indication of an upcoming price rally.

• Bitcoin, as with most of crypto, is known for being pretty volatile when compared to traditional investment instruments. Its future is uncertain, and the space is (for the most part) still largely unregulated. Recently however, analysts have been noticing that BTC isn’t following its regular volatility pattern, and some think it could be an indication of an imminent bull market rally.

• What does it mean for BTC?

• BTC has had flat volatility in the face of stock market volatility before, but some experts believe that this time could be different. Economic recovery and lowered inflation rates could result in a return to mainstream crypto adoption, which could cause a recoupling of the volatilities of the two worlds. Not only that, but Bitcoin is about to undergo its fourth halving (an event which halves the rewards for BTC miners) in just over a year’s time. Bitcoin halvings typically result in upward price movements before they occur every four years.

31,"Why Powerful People, SEC, FED, IMF, Central Banks and Governments Fear Cryptocurrency",11a8e9g,"As we all know, cryptocurrencies have not been very loved by people in power and governments this is why I bring you this post to discuss why powerful people and governments fear and hate cryptocurrencies.

# Corruption 💰

Cryptocurrencies area direct threat to established financial institutions and the power structures that support them. Crypto provides a decentralized and trust less alternative to traditional banking and they have the potential to erode the power and influence of established financial institutions and the individuals who benefit from them. This is why crypto is a major threat to the interests of powerful people and organizations who rely on the current system to maintain their wealth and influence.

# Transparency 👻

Also, powerful people and governments generates crypto FUD saying that it is only used for criminal activities which is not totally a lie because there are individuals that use crypto for illegal activities but this also can applied to traditional currencies. The beneficial part of crypto against traditional currencies is that can be tracked and traced through blockchain which means that it is more transparent than traditional currencies.

# Control and power 🔏

Furthermore, governments fear cryptocurrencies because crypto is a challenge to their monopoly on the creation and distribution of currency because it allows individuals to bypass government-controlled currencies. This reduces the power and influence of governments over financial systems and this is a major threat to the power and control that governments have over their citizens.

**My personal final conclusion**

Even if they try with all their power they could only slow down crypto adoption in the short term but I truly believe that crypto is unstoppable and they will have no other choice to adopt it. Regarding all the fear I understand their position because if affects their happy status quo and their corruption ways which they will have to adapt to crypto. In the end, crypto is for the people.

I am happy to be alive to witness this revolution.

This is my first crypto winter and things can take U-turns for the worse even if Putin Sneezes, Biden Falls, or Just It does because It Can, And yes because of exchanges being screwed! I’m scared!

Not holding any of my cryptos in exchange but still, the question arises in my mind how long this winter will be!! Though there are some Green Goblins Around but Still a Bear Market.

All my profits are wiped out! So I’m confused and don’t see any silver line here !!

I gave an attempt to understand the crypto winter and tried to analyze 2014, 2018, and 2020 winters but to my lame eyes, I don’t find any similarities - except one!

The only similarity they all have is the worst of expectations from everyone towards crypto and a complete sense of disbelief in crypto.

Right now I think people are in that zone and it’s my first and it makes me scared as hell because it is a rocky time.

33,Why Bitcoin is more than just investment for me.,11a7qyo,"Unlike FIAT, which we're obliged to use by our centralized institutions (governments and central banks), Bitcoin is operating in a free market. (Would love to see FIAT's behave in a free market). Despite of that, it's undeniable that its appearance showed the world people were craving for a deflactionary trustworthy alternative for a store of value (for the moment i'll go with this, although btc can be so much more) free of governmental hands. Because the truth is, it's almost impossible owning something without government knowing about it.


And yes, it's true that the biggest part of Bitcoin is routed by centralized exchanges, but we can't forget it's peer-to-peer, so in the future (with wider adoption) bitcoin could be a way of maintaining the anonimaty of paper money (that will disappear, sooner or later).


Bitcoin is also the first digital man made scarce asset, and a response to all the QE, wich is a way of robbery. Don't get me wrong: FIAT have enormous advantages on its side, such as salability and anonimaty. It's the most liquid way of money we'll have, but it's also debt created. Debt creation is literally how FIAT is mined. 

So, for me, bitcoin is revolutionary exactly because its innherent rules don't change and if that happens one day (51% attack), well, that day will be the last of bitcoin.

Bitcoin and FiAT will coexist, but bitcoin will incentivise saving and lower time preference. It has a powerfull ideia behind: no one has more power over the protocol, no matter how bitcoin possesses. So I DCA every month, not only because I expect BTC to value more in the future, but also because we need a shift in our economical paradigm. The quality of a society is as good as its means of exchange. We have to pass from a credit way of evolving to a savings way of evolving.

And that's why i'm not that concerned about short term bitcoin price. Bear market or bull market is the same, because I don't intend to change back to €€ the value I already own in satoshis, but rather using those satoshis to interact direclty with other economical pears in the future.

Hope this can calm and shinning some light to the most nervous of you guys. If not, well, at least I tried.

34,"Beyond the hype, Layer-2 scaling solutions are here to scale computation and drive innovation.",11a7fl0,"Ethereum scalability remains a long standing issue and the number of users has also continued to increase putting more strain on the blockchain. The result is high cost of using the network and low throughput. A number of Layer 2 scaling solutions have been developed to improve the speed and the efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain. This is achieved by processing transactions on 3rd party networks instead of the Ethereum mainnet.

These Layer-2 scaling solutions: State channels, Sidechains, Plasma, Validium, Zero-knowledge Rollups, and Optimistic Rollups each having its advantages and disadvantages. Recently, a lot of attention has been on Zero-knowledge Rollups (Zk Rollups) projects such as SYS, LRC, ZKS and ZKP as well as the upcoming Polygon ZkEVM with Optimistic Rollups projects such as OP, Arbitrum and CTSI not too far behind.

I find Cartesi's solution quite interesting even though the project is less popular than the likes of Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Cartesi can run an entire Linux OS at the execution layer with a RISC-V-based VM for high-intensity computation and it's chain-agnostic. The combination of an Optimistic Rollups framework and the Cartesi Machine Emulator enables the development of smart contracts and DApps using any package or library that is available for Linux. This means that web2 developers can easily code smart contracts using familiar programming languages like Python, Java, c++ and Rust without the need to learn Solidity.

Even though it's still early in 2023, layer-2s aren't slowing down (Coinbase today announced it's Layer-2 blockchain, Base). Layer-2 scaling solutions are still coming up with new ideas and helping Ethereum grow in new ways, like gaming, AI and Web2 integrations.

35,Do file storage and transfer blockchain projects appeal to science institutions?,11a7dqu,"I've seen a few different blockchain projects related to data storage and transfer (eg. ARweave, file coin, WeSendIt). Have any 'big data' science projects or institutions bought in to the various file storage and transfer blockchain projects?  On paper these should appeal to any organization that routinely handles and distributes a lot of data. This immediately makes me think of applications to mega science projects like astronomical observatories, which can create terabytes of new data on a weekly basis (data which then needs to be distributed around the world to various scientists and collaborators.) Is there any reason why these projects would or would not be appealing to them? I presume that these institutions are already used to handling their data storage and distribution 'in-house', and for them to be interested in  blockchain services they would need to be cheaper than whatever the in-house cost is. I wonder how much of the absence-of-interest is due to the cost vs. simply the scientists in charge don't know about such block chain projects.

They’re going to want to capitalize on that so they either make them more expensive, mint more, or get in on the secondary sales. In my opinion it makes way more sense to introduce their market for buying, selling, and trading and then drop Gen 3 so they get the secondary revenue. 

The only benefit to Reddit for an instant sell out is press, but they don’t make more money directly. If they had all the hype of the Gen 3 drop on their own platform it would get way more interaction and instantly return revenue.

We viewed the property and pics via Zillow, visited the area, looked at the school district, the walkability score, etc. We were 100% positive we would buy it without ever visiting the property itself. However, of course we visited it before actually buying. The real estate agent walked us through the space, we gave him an offer, it was accepted, we got the condo, and the real estate agent walked off with a cool 3% off the top.

Now imagine the not-so-distant future when NFTs take care of the paperwork and offer, and virtual reality contraptions can ""walk"" us through the property. Will it be necessary to have real estate agents? Maybe. Maybe not, but i feel like they definitely wouldn't need a commission that nets them thousands of dollars.

Maybe in the future real estate agents simply become well-paid doormen - people trusted with keys to a property that walk you through the space and make $30/hr - not 3% of the home's value.

BTC - from my paycheck I use CoinBase’s direct deposit option and have $250 go directly into buying BTC every two weeks. This is a “free” option to purchase, as they don’t charge additional fees. I’ve been doing this since they introduced it as an option a little over 2 years ago. 

BTC - $100 every Wednesday recurring purchase. Just stacking more sats.

BTC - $10 everyday recurring purchase.

LTC - $10 everyday recurring purchase.

DOGE - 1,000 Doge every Friday. 

Then I also use the CB debit card religiously and take XLM as the reward. I’ve been splitting this to stay 1/2 XLM and 1/2 between an APY paying asset (ALGO & ATOM at the moment). 

The biggest thing to realize with this strategy is to not worry about the price you’re buying it at. The goal is to accumulate coins until you either run out of money or you die. I don’t see any other option.

45,Ethereum 2.0 sharding system is a centralization demon. It incentivizes creating multiple validators for better rewards.,11a4xmg,"Part of the wow of Etherium 2.0 is its horizontal scale strategy via shards. It gives it unspeakable speed in processing transactions.

But nothing comes for free, and I am not talking about the crazy complexity of this project that is still spinning... 

The shards system unknowingly incentivizes people to create multiple validators instead of one. One may think that it is a good thing, but then your read:

# [40%+ of Ethereum PoS nodes are controlled by two addresses](https://cointelegraph.com/news/40-ethereum-pos-nodes-are-controlled-by-two-addresses-says-santiment-data)

Of course, it will be the case. Etherume 2.0 is pushing for it. And those two addresses' owners are collecting over 50% of the total system reward. So over time, they will have an even higher stake and reward. 

You can follow my other thread [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4645116/ethereum-pets-in-a-room-game), where I try to calculate the math of it. Meanwhile, I can tell you that based on a [simulation](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4645158/101178) that I ran, splitting the stake across multiple validators can yield up to 4 times the reward you will get with a single one.

The way that I see it, there are two ways to get out of this mess:

1. I know that Ether devs will hate me for suggesting it, but: Don't use shards.
2. Use an exponential stake evaluation system, as I did in [Confidence Coin](https://confidence-coin.com/). It makes one validator produce a higher reward than a split and empowers decentralization.

46,10-year Bitcoin holders are holding more BTC than ALL exchanges together and the trend is just getting worse and worse for exchanges.,11a4wp7,"We always seem to have the conception here that Crypto exchanges are by far the most powerful entities in Crypto and can move markets just as they want. But in reality the power of exchanges has been decreasing for quite a while now and seems to have no sign of recovery right now. The Bitcoin supply on exchanges decreased form a peak of 3.2M BTC during 2020 to now 2.2M BTC.

While exchanges would usually stock up during bear markets, this time it just decreased further and one group of holders has even gained more supply than all exchanges together. The 10+ year holders of Bitcoin have gathered a staggering 2.6M BTC, which is 13.8% of the total supply.

Since then those „“ancient“ holders have more supply than those big centralized exchanges that probably have a lot of institutional investors behind them. This just happens to show that the power of holding is greater than the institutional and stealing-from-customers power.

Exchanges are seeing their value decrease more and more, now they either have to buy during the bull market at elevated prices (which would make the price sky-rocket even more in a bull) or they will slowly but steadily lose their influence while real holders will just keep increasing their strength.

47,Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 turns negative for the first time since the FTX crash,11a4tjy," 

In recent days, the largest traditional securities market index, the S&P 500 (SPX), has stopped positively correlating with Bitcoin (BTC). This situation has arisen for the first time since the FTX exchange crash in November 2022 and for the second time in 14 months. Does this mean that Bitcoin can once again be treated as a hedge against inflation?

 The narrative that Bitcoin is such a hedge gained popularity before inflation became a global problem. It was expected that in a situation of uncontrolled printing of fiat currency, BTC and other major cryptocurrencies would respond with growth or at least maintain their value. This would be indicated by the logic of supply and demand and the guaranteed impossibility of ""printing"" Bitcoin through cryptography.

However, the sharp rise in inflation in most world economies in 2022 coincided with the bearish cryptocurrency market. There are voices that suggest that it was precisely the peaks of national currency inflation not seen in 40 years that led to a deepening decline in cryptocurrencies and other high-risk assets. In the United States, the CPI peak was recorded in June 2022 at 9.1%, while in the European Union in October 2022 at 10.6%. In Poland, the highest values also appeared in October at 17.9%.

High inflation triggered a natural reaction of policy tightening of quantitative easing, liquidity and money supply decline, and interest rate increase. The biggest winner was the US dollar index (DXY), which began its bull market in June 2021. Risky assets, such as stock indices or cryptocurrencies, headed south.

So it seems that Bitcoin did not live up to the hopes placed in it. At the time of the test, it succumbed to the iron rules of financial markets and the slogan ""Cash is king"". However, there is a glimmer of hope for cryptocurrency maximalists. If it turns out that Bitcoin can behave differently than traditional assets (symbolized by the SPX index), lose correlation with them, and go its own way, then perhaps the narrative of hedging against inflation would find its second life.

Negative correlation of Bitcoin and S&P 500 In recent days, an interesting and rare phenomenon has appeared on the Bitcoin and S&P 500 correlation chart. It was noticed by the well-known on-chain analyst   [@WClementeIII](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII), , who wrote that for the first time since the FTX crash, the daily correlation has become negative:  


 https://twitter.com/WClementeIII/status/1628111289045090327?s=20   


Looking more closely at the daily charts of BTC, SPX, and their mutual correlation (blue), we see that for the vast majority of 2022, the assets remained in a strong positive correlation. Excluding the FTX crash in November 2022, the last time the correlation was negative was in December 2021 (orange line).

Furthermore, the FTX crash led to a strong collapse of the cryptocurrency market and a decline in Bitcoin's price (red area). Meanwhile, SPX quotes continued to move up (green area). Therefore, the previous loss of correlation played out to the detriment of BTC.

Is the SPX correction a bullish signal for Bitcoin?   
 

However, the current loss of correlation may lead to the opposite effect. Recently, SPX recorded its first higher peak in many months and broke resistance at 4100 USD. However, after this bullish event, a correction began and a decline to the current level around 4000 USD.   


 The cryptocurrency analyst  [@24KCrypto](https://twitter.com/24KCrypto)   tweeted his price prediction for SPX today. According to him, the index needs to complete a flat correction structure A-B-C with a bottom around 3800 USD.

48,From Whoppers to Wallets: The Odd Story of Burger King's Cryptocurrency,11a4rdu,"##wtf? When?

Whoppercoin was launched by Burger King in Russia in 2017. It was designed as a loyalty program to reward customers for purchasing Whopper burgers at Burger King restaurants in Russia. For every ruble (Russian currency) that a customer spent on a Whopper burger, they would receive one Whoppercoin.

Customers could then use these Whoppercoins to purchase other items on the Burger King menu, such as additional burgers or drinks. Alternatively, they could save up their Whoppercoins and trade them with other customers on the exchange market.

##The launch

At the time of its launch, Whoppercoin was built on the Waves blockchain platform, which allowed for fast and low-cost transactions. Waves also offered a user-friendly interface that made it easy for Burger King customers to manage their Whoppercoins, and it gained a significant amount of attention.

Burger King was criticized for promoting an unhealthy diet by using a cryptocurrency to encourage people to consume more fast food even though they already used currency to buy fast food.

50,Realistic expectations of returns and how to avoid potential scams,11a48cx,"When deciding which crypto currencies to invest in it's important to know the market cap and supply. You can find this information on websites like coinmarketcap.

# Market Capitalization 

In order for the coin to 10x in value the market cap will also need to 10x so coins with a lower market cap can have a higher chance of returns although this also shows that there's less people willing to invest their money in that particular coin. So maybe a minimum market cap of 10m could be the limit.

# Supply

Circulating Supply and Max Supply is very important. Some coins don't give this information which means you have no idea how many coins the founders hold. This is how rug pulls usually occur, the founders will sell more coins than exchanges believe exist. Coins with a lower max supply are probably more valuable than those with a higher supply although it depends on the project and use cases.

The Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin in the BUSD/DAI trading pair depegged  from the US dollar and briefly dropped to $0.2 USD. According to Binance trading history, the depeg occurred around 11:00 UTC 22/02/23. Only one sell order worth $647,000 could have caused such a significant downturn.

However, BUSD has already returned to its normal level. The total volume of sell orders at the $0.3 USD level is $3.5 million USD. It is unknown who was able to sell BUSD at nearly $650,000 USD. The cryptocurrency community speculates that the order was filled due to a potential calculation error.

BUSD Issues BUSD has been experiencing problems for weeks, not just due to market conditions. In mid-February, the American company Paxos suspended the issuance of BUSD due to claims from the financial regulator of the state of New York. Earlier, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Paxos of violating investor protection laws. According to media reports, the SEC's main claim against Paxos is related to BUSD. The Wall Street Journal reports that the US exchange regulator considers Binance cryptocurrency to be an unregistered security.

Nansen noted that 90% of BUSD, with a market capitalization of over $12 billion USD, is on Binance. Therefore, the cryptocurrency exchange could suffer in the event of a panic sell-off of the stablecoin. It is known that about 94% of tokens are held in just four wallets.

I've highlighted some of the points that stood out to me and posted them below.

&#x200B;

first element is to safeguard monetary sovereignty and stability by strengthening monetary policy and not granting crypto assets official currency or legal tender status.

https://preview.redd.it/0cy2wuyd6zja1.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba428894118a918215ad92f7dd03100e2f38f9ef

one of the risk they point out is that households will invest in crypto assets that are not pegged to fiat currency. why would we want something pegged to highly inflationary fiat currency?

they argue that pricing items in crypto would waist the merchants time because they would have to constantly monitor the market and adjust pricing due to the instability of crypto prices.

and the biggest reason to not grant cryptocurrencies legal tender status - because they are not issued by the government.

they make a point that a government issued cryptocurrency or digital asset would be different because the government would be the one backing it.

https://preview.redd.it/6vzohuyd6zja1.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5c912a5e4f11da8d62e507d1305f15aa652c3e4a

another big point for them to have to work together is that crypto is borderless and if one government is against crypto alone it can't really stop anything since people can still use somewhere else.

Widespread adoption would also have significant implications for the international monetary system in the long term - 

this is the entire point of crypto.

54,The average purchase price of short-term holders is about to be higher than the average purchase of all other buyers. This has historically signaled the near-end of a bear market.,11a3sxu,"We all know the spot market price we see of Bitcoin, which shows the current price of BTC, but there is actually one way to show an even better price metric. The Realized Price, is the average purchase price of all Bitcoins in circulations. It is calculated by the value of all BTC and their purchase price divided by the circulating supply. Also known as the “average cost basis“, this probably the most important on-chain metric.

Now, we can also distinguish between the Realized Price, meaning the average purchase price, of different buying groups, such as short-term or long-term holders. One pattern that has been evident throughout bitcoins history is that once the short-term holders average purchase price is above the average purchase price of all buying groups, the end of the bear market is nigh…

This is exactly what is happening right now, the short-term holder Realized Price stands at $19.6k and the “normal“ Realized Price is at $19.8k, a cross will very likely happen very soon and thus the end of the bear market has either already happened or is very near.

55,Why the SEC might do us a favor,11a3rx7,"I might be a little late for this but still wanted to get my thoughts out there.

Kraken got ordered to shut down their staking services after they got sued by the SEC. This may sound bad at first, but heres why i think in the long run its actually positive:

Kraken discontinuing their staking services in the US leaves a lot of customers asking themselves what to do now. They could switch to another CEX, e.g. Coinbase, but since the SEC came after Kraken, we cant rule out that they wont go after Coinbase too.

But what are the other options? Missing out on 4.17% APY on your ETH? Who would want to do that? Not the people who already staked on Kraken.

So where do they go? They move their ETH onchain. Never has it been easier to stake your ETH because of LSDs (Liquid Staking Derivatives e.g. stETH or rETH)

Now let me elaborate why the timing may be so perfect:

One disadvantage of staking was not being able to withdraw your ETH. But exactly this changes in March when withdrawals will probably be enabled. This makes the staking experience even smoother.

Another pleasant side effect of Ethereum is the deflationary supply. The more onchain activity, the more ETH gets burned, which increases the overall staking APY even more. 

But what does this mean for LSDs?

For one, they will most likely secure an even bigger part of the staking marketshare. Meaning more customers, therefore more revenue. 

But even more important in my opinion is, that this will take us one step further down the way of decentralization.

Since ETH staked with a centralized exchange is controlled by them, its harder to establish true decentralization. But because the SEC and Gensler dont want people using CEXs for staking, they move their ETH in self custodial wallets and stake with more decentralized options.

Overall this doesnt look all too bad now, does it?

56,"Between Biden and Trump, which US presidential administration has benefited crypto more?",11a3qyb,"Obviously this question only accounts for a smaller portion of the pie since crypto is global and this is just the U.S. specifically.

Back in the earlier years during the Obama administration, the crypto space was generally still small and mostly not understood from a policy standpoint allowing most coins to skirt by unabated by politics.

Nowadays I'm not sure there's anything that isn't political. That especially includes crypto.

But thinking back the last presidencies including the Biden administration, I had a hard time determining which benefits the space as a whole more.

Conservatives generally speaking allow for looser regulation and more tax breaks and free flowing funds for some of the highest earning corporations. Generally speaking I don't think the voter base is as pro crypto as the left, but the actual effect of the Trump presidency allowed more money to flow into the space while generally not changing legality.

This is interesting because in a completely different way the Biden Admin has also benefited the space through massive cash infusions to the general public during COVID, which many people utilized for riskier assets even if they were also tightening the corporate side and attempting to regulate the space tighter as it's grown (which in of itself some people see as a good and a bad thing.)

An argument could obviously be made for either and obviously Trump and Biden as figureheads aren't the sole power in the executive branch. It's still difficult for me to decide which has done ""better"" for the space overall.

Edit: what have I done 😬

P.S. should crypto even be regulated at all by governments? I think light regulation would be preferred, but the amount of old people that don't understand the space should NOT be enacting policy around it.",shlammyjohnson,49,0,0.5

58,Origins of Cryptocurrency: The Untold Story of Bit Gold,11a3bjm,"Most people don't actually know that BitGold was created in 1998, and the was the first Cryptocurrency. Not Bitcoin. 

So here's a list of facts about Bit Gold you might not know of. 

##1
Development: Bit gold was developed by Nick Szabo, a computer scientist and cryptographer, in the late 1990s. Szabo is also known for coining the term ""smart contracts"" and has been credited with laying the foundations for modern cryptocurrencies.

##2
Concept: The concept of Bit gold was based on using cryptography to create a decentralized digital currency that could be exchanged without the need for a centralized intermediary. It aimed to address some of the flaws in traditional fiat currencies, such as the risk of inflation and the potential for government interference.

##3
Mechanism: Bit gold was designed to work by recording transactions on a decentralized ledger, similar to the blockchain technology used in modern cryptocurrencies. It used a proof-of-work system to validate transactions and prevent fraud, which is also a key feature of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies.

##4
Unique features: Bit gold had some unique features, such as the use of digital signatures to verify ownership of coins and the inclusion of a timestamp to prevent double-spending. It also allowed users to convert their Bit gold coins into physical gold through a process called ""hashcash postage.""

##5
Limited adoption: Bit gold never gained widespread adoption and was largely overshadowed by the emergence of Bitcoin in 2009. However, its influence can be seen in the development of subsequent cryptocurrencies and the broader concept of decentralized finance.

##6
Legacy: Despite its limited impact, Bit gold is still considered an important milestone in the history of cryptocurrency. It demonstrated the potential for using cryptography to create a decentralized financial system and helped to inspire the development of subsequent cryptocurrencies that have revolutionized the world of finance.

##7
Open-source: Bit gold was open-source, which means that its code was freely available for others to use and modify. This allowed developers to build on top of the existing technology and make improvements or create new applications.

##8
Incomplete implementation: While the concept of Bit gold was revolutionary, the actual implementation was incomplete. Szabo never fully developed the technology or released a fully functional version of the software.

##9
Similarities with Bitcoin: Bit gold shares many similarities with Bitcoin, including the use of proof-of-work to validate transactions and the decentralized ledger system. Bitcoin has been credited with taking the concept of Bit gold to the next level and making it more accessible to the general public.

##10
Inspiration for other cryptocurrencies: Bit gold has inspired the development of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. It laid the groundwork for the development of Ethereum, which introduced the concept of smart contracts and has led to the creation of a whole ecosystem of decentralized applications",Some1fromReddit,18,2,0.6

I think that many people especially newbies dont have any idea what will they do when the bull run comes. I nearly lost all my money in the bull run because I didnt have any plans and made so many dumb trades. Another problem is that when the bull run comes even the most dumb projects will skyrocket and you will start to fomo. DYOR, set up your strategy and plan your trades now or you will end up like me or many other people.

62,it is not worthwhile to accept direct bank transfer for selling your bitcoin to another person,11a2ied,"A mistakes many newbies made for crypto trading is to not use the crypto exchange to sell their crypto but instead directly accept an offer from a random stranger to sell their crypto to and receive the fund in their bank account directly from the stranger.
Many a time, these strangers that offered such deal are using the newbies and their account to do money laundering for their illegal activities. Once the newbies got the fund in their bank accounts, their bank accounts would get frozen. This is because the funds are also usually acquire through illegal means like scam from other victims. Due to this, the funds have to be frozen. By then the stranger buyers have already got the cryptocurrency and might had already sold them to others.

64,How crypto media pumps up shitcoins. A case study on Big Eyes Coin and Analytics Insight.,11a0rnq,"# I read a ton of news articles about crypto all the time and i noticed that certain media outlets pump up certain shitcoins. I will use Big Eyes Coin and Analytics Insight as an example but they are far from the only ones who do this.

Lets take a look at the type of article that is written to purely create artifical hype and pump a coin. 

&#x200B;

Mixing in the shitcoin with somewhat legit news about crypto. Here they write articles about BTC and Ethereum price and include their shitcoin to attract more eyeballs:

* Bitcoin Dominates Crypto and Ethereum Back In The Green; Can Big Eyes Coin Reach $50 Million?
* Reality Check for Bitcoin, Ethereum as Big Eyes Coin Bags $28m Presale

&#x200B;

Hint at crazy gains:

* Crypto Stocks With 10X Profit Potential — Big Eyes Coin, Stellar, and Shiba Inu

&#x200B;

Try to associate the shitcoin with bigger and legit projects:

* Bitcoin, Big Eyes Coin, and Cardano: Which Offers the Best Security and Privacy?
* Ethereum, Bitcoin, Big Eyes Coin Rate High As Experts Tip Cryptocurrency To Shine In 2023

&#x200B;

Create Fomo:

* Big Eyes Coin Crosses $28 Million In Presale; Read, Why Floki And Shiba Inu Should Take Note Of It

&#x200B;

Analytics Insight released more than 30 Articles of this type. If you think they did this simply because the like the project and not because they hold a big bag than i have a bridge to sell you.

Do yourself a favor and stay away from these types of media outlets and shitcoins.

66,Moon Metrics (Moontrics) - Round 36,11a1p3y,"I love spreadsheets, graphs, data and crypto. So I've collected all the data posted in the Moon distribution .CSV files, made some sense of it all in a spreadsheet, then made us some graphs.

# Total Karma

https://preview.redd.it/54a8yxlhawja1.png?width=1413&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fd437f9637dc221555e4341af97310df5bb6e070

The Sum of all the karma per round

A 4% decrease since the last round. I've added the average BTC price for the 28 day Moon round to this graph as the total karma has seemed to move up and down in line with its price. I've done other analysis posts that show we get activity spikes when BTC fluctuates, with the most happening during dips as it seems that misery likes company.   
The spike at round 33 was probably from all the FTX bullshit and the 700 news link posts about it every hour.

I'd expect roughly the same amount of karma next round, but who knows what shit will go down in the next few weeks.

# The ratio of Moons to karma

https://preview.redd.it/28dkbixlawja1.png?width=1413&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4fda907652dd318c5adc28a778a4b860e159dd95

The all important Moon to karma ratio. Multiply this number by your karma score to determine how many Moons you receive for each round. (Round 12 - 0.88 [Never Forget](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mvzv9v/anyone_remember_that_time_last_week_when_the_moon/))

This number will naturally decline over time as the Moons released per round reduce by 2.5%.

Round 36 - HO-LEE-SHYTE  
The admins told us they were closing the testnet bridge and burning all the Moons, [one of the other mods made an announcement post to let everyone know](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10srtbi/the_moons_bridge_to_arbitrum_nova_has_been/)   
We asked admins if half of the Moons would be re-introduced in the next round and they said 'nah'   
They were either lying, fucking with us, or they done fucked something up ^(It wouldnt be the first time they fucked something up) because half of those Moons were indeed re-introduced.   
An additional million Moons were added to the regular amount which more than doubled the ratio everyone was expecting. Crazy times  


# Number of users on .CSV

This shows the number of users who earned karma for each round. The lower orange line is users with an active vault at the time the .CSV was published.

The number of users with vaults at the time of publishing the data overall averages around 60%. This doesn't indicate that only 60% of the users claim their Moons though as you have 6 months from the distribution to open your vault and claim them.

# % of users with a vault

The spike from round 28 to 29 was caused by the implementation of CCIP 031 which removed vaultless users with less than 10 karma from the .csv

# Average Moons per user & Median Moons per user

The increase in average and median from round 28 to 29 was also caused by the implementation of CCIP 031.

The average Moons earnt per user takes into account a lot of factors: number of users, Moon to karma ratio, the reduction in Moons being released per round and the total karma.  


Is weird how the ratio spike has increased the average but not the median.

I'm certainly not saying we're in a bull market, and I don't think one is necessarily on the horizon. In fact, I hope it holds off for a good while so I can keep accruing in my tiny increments. I've stacked enough this winter to have more money than I've ever had come next bull run, but that's not my goal. I'm trying to be debt free and have a little (or a lot) extra. I need more time for this to happen. I'm not a trader so my DCA is basically what I have to rely on. I probably won't reach my goal, but hopefully I get close.

Last few days give me so many thoughts regarding it. It all started with need to purchase something online without need to do it via card or tradition bank transfer for whatever reason I can have for it. For the record I live in the east Europe and we talking about less then fckin $100 in the local currency rate. 

So it would be great if I could just paid with Monero or even any other crypto currency. But obviously that's not an option. So what are my options? Well I thought let's try Paysafe card which can be bought for cash at my local grocery store. So I did. It's time for payment. 
I'm entering the card code at the store. Ups error ""error you are connected to a VPN"" well indeed yes I am. Disconnect VPN try again. Error ""your card has been blocked for security reasons contact support "" whaaaat? So I did...4 days ago. 

My less then $100 is frozen for my own safety of course. There is absolutely no response from the support, I've even tried contact via local call center. The lady on the other side ask for tone of sensitive informations just to tell me that I need to wait for email response...Now the thing is it's all the same with banks or any other centralized payments provider.

69,What are your thoughts on Cardano?,11a0wjx,"I for one have held ADA quite a few times, but have been discouraged because of Charles Hoskinson and his ego. 

I also think there are better blockchains than Cardano, for instance, **Algorand** and **Ethereum**.

(I do not hold ALGO)

I've noticed the shillers in this sub who are die hard ADA supporters, but that just might be because of the bags they hold and the fact that they might have lost money and that they are only holding onto hope at this point for it to go back up to it's all time high again.

Personally speaking, I see no future in it, especially with Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions like, **Optimism**, **Arbitrum**, and even **Loopering,** and of course, **Polygon**.  Even saw a post earlier that Polygon co-founder saying their is no future in it(I'll take his opinion with a grain of salt). Truth is, and it's been said many times over ""We don't know shit about fuck"".

I for one though, have a bigger feeling that Cardano will turn into nothing. I believe it'll be a blockchain that gets left behind, kinda like the start ups from 2017.

70,How not to FOMO - a simple guide,11a0nkk,"I would argue that everyone's goal here is to stack as much BTC as possible before the next bull run. In doing so many will resolve to buying popular alts hoping that they would outperform BTC.

In 2022 many have fallen into this trap FOMOing into overvalued alts at their pico top. In order to not make such mistakes it is VERY useful to look at ALT/BTC charts.

Let's take MATIC as a quite popular option recently. If you take a look at MATIC/USD chart it says MATIC is ¬$1.4... which is an okay price... nothing wrong with it. 

[MATIC \/ USDT on a weekly timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/bocortdzhyja1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ebed6497fc6df329caca274744d2961a81d4c16a)

It used to be ¬$3.0 so not a big issue... still looks cheapish. But then if you take a look at MATIC/BTC chart... you see this:

[MATIC \/ BTC on a weekly timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/i7gx2suuhyja1.png?width=1321&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2982ed94c8ca2dc49476474d0fec9fe1deb57281)

MATIC is almost at all time high in its valuation against Bitcoin. 

If you wanted to buy altcoin which would outperform BTC in the near future I would argue that there are much better options.

Examples of some alts that are not hyped right now and might be undervalued against BTC.

[DOT \/ BTC on a weekly timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/gfbnateriyja1.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=250fd50839754112cdfdac0c31ffcd690a58c576)

Of course no one can be 100% sure what will happen in the future but at least we can make sure that we are not playing against the odds. The worst thing you can do is get into an already popular option. It will by definition be overvalued against BTC.

I’ll start off by saying I’ve lost over 20k on CRO. I am currently holding as taking a L on that much money would hurt too much.

Next is LRC. I’ve lost 1k on LRC. I’ve sold it when it was near the bottom and now I see it going up. (pain)

Next is ADA. I’ve got ADA at a good price for just under a $1. I bought a lot and ended up being up over 16k when it was at $4. Sadly I didn’t sell and now I am holding at a lost of around 3k. I believe it will rise again and will sell when I’m up.

Next is Polkadot. I bought over $1000 worth when it was at over $45 per coin. Watching it drop to under $10 hurt and i’ve sold that coin at a loss.

The only coins i’ve made money on and are up on is Moons, ETH, BTC, and Doge. Doge was the only coin i’ve successfully bought and sold at a profit.

The biggest lesson i’ve learned from losing over 24k on crypto is to take profits. I am now just waiting for the next bull run so I can hopefully make my money back on CRO, and ADA. Soon as I break even I plan to sell.

1. Set a target price: Before you start investing, set a target price at which you want to sell. This will help you avoid making emotional decisions and selling too early or too late. Accept that it will hurt if you sell too early AND if you sell too soon. 
2. Use stop-loss orders. Don’t be FTX
3. Don't get too greedy
4. Keep an eye on market indicators: there are 1 million YouTube videos about this. Spend time understanding what the fundamentals are. Do not pretend that next time will be different. I remember so many people were saying that a death cross wouldn’t be a big deal last bull run. “This time it’ll be different” is a red flag.

I've been researching a few projects lately and I'm trying to understand some basics when it comes to supply.

I see often that a low circulating supply compared to max supply is seen as a red flag. Why exactly is this? I hear the phrase ""dilution"" thrown around a lot. Is the fear that the project (or its mechanisms) can print x many tokens, introduce them to the market, and crater price?

On the other hand, is a project with a low circulating supply to max supply ""early?"" Meaning, if a token theoretically has a max supply of 4 billion and a circulating supply of 2 million, could this be a green flag instead of a red flag? Signaling that you are an early buyer of what you feel is a promising project or token?

76,A Few Thoughts and Predictions on Bitcoin and the US Dollar,119zht8,"**Bitcoin**:

The value gap ($24.4k to $30k) I highlighted previously is still acting as resistance. Value gaps are a range of low volume (per price) and an inefficiency in the market that can sometimes act as resistance. In this case, it rejected Bitcoin twice since the summer of 2022.

Part of me wants a stronger rejection so I can get a good DCA entry but 2/3 of retracements past 90 days were bullish, and while momentum indicates some exhaustion on lower timeframes, thats not the only factor.

The ideal scenario for **bulls** is a swing down to \~22.9k before rallying for another shot at penetrating the value range. If bulls recover $25k, I would expect consolidation before any attempts to tackle $30k. Recovering $30k would lead Bitcoin (and the larger market) to the next higher value range between $30k and $40k.

The ideal scenario for **bears** is losing a couple levels of support (listed in earlier posts). $20.8k goal for bears, with a weekly close under that invalidating the uptrend. That might not lead to significant downside, but could return to a bearish crab and revisit the upper teens. I feel that new lows are unlikely as it took very significant events (Luna, FTX) to reach them last time; overall the market is much healthier today than in mid 2022.

[Bitcoin with the value gap highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/awdarc4a8yja1.png?width=3668&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=83b07071af112ca05f053bb3b595caeff0c8bd63)

**US Dollar Index**:

February was a month of moderate recovery for the US Dollar Index (DXY). After an incredible rally through 2022, peaking in Q4 at 114.7, the DXY began retracing to a critical level below 101.7.

Historically (7 times) closing below the 101.7 level signaled larger drops for DXY. It narrowly dodged that fate with a solid bounce and February rally back to 104.6.

For the past two weeks 104.6 acted as resistance. I think in part this is due to mixed economic data showing an inconsistent recovery, and its also unclear what peak rate will be and how long we maintain it.

The Euro is looking healthy with it's recovery since September ongoing. **This alone may be enough pressure to stifle a recovery for the Dollar**.

Of course I'm not an economist. There is room for more upside on the Dollar, but my gut tells me this is a small rally with more downside in the future, which is bullish for equities, crypto, etc.

[The US Dollar Index with key levels marked](https://preview.redd.it/nvk9059bayja1.png?width=3668&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1aa2729471b5ba81c9ba365a19b3858510fab442)

**Bottom Line - What does this mean?**

I expect increased volatility in the coming weeks. Even if the Dollar continues to drop and Bitcoin closes over $25k, there is a lot of volatility that accompanies an inefficiency in the market like that $25k-$30K value gap.

At the same time, while economic data is improving, its still mixed and some of the unknowns are jockeying markets up and down as the Fed and other government attempt to navigate a landing after a hard year+ of battling inflation.

I'm an active DCA'er since Q4 2022, but I've slowed my pace in this range. I'm not planning to sell, but I DCA less than I did from November to January. This is mostly because I think entries on any token or coin when Bitcoin was below $20k are going to remain as the floor and we are unlikely to see lower. It also reduces my tax liability if I hold through this year.

78,How I am gambling my money in 2023,119z7it,"The year is 2023 and I find myself eager to find the next crypto holy grail. I try my best to be patient and research into different projects. I spend time scrolling this sub, scrolling Coingecko, but still wary about spending money on my next loss (Lol). 

But then it occurred to me, my holy grail has been right in front of me this whole time! Moons! I can earn them and I can buy some here and there! All under the glorious roof of Reddit! What better candidate for me? I enjoy this sub, lurking here and occasionally commenting. This is my first leap at an actual post! 

I have even been using MEXC to purchase my extra Moons. So far the experience has been decent, although confusing at times. I am not too tech savvy so I am working on a spreadsheet I will post in the future, but my first purchases have been between .16-.17 . 

If you got this far, thank you for reading! I will post a follow up post soon.

They also could have been liquidated a while ago.

82,Why self-custody is important and why you should move your coins off the exchange and keep them in your own wallet.,119y68q," “Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.” – Satoshi Nakamoto, circa 2009 

When the 2008 financial crisis hit big banks basically destroyed the world's economy and got away with it. Only a few countries actually did something about it.

* Iceland cleaned the house and jailed over 25 bankers for their shady practices,
* Spain jailed 11,
* Ireland only 7.

Guess how many were jailed in the US? Only one. That's right, and he was just a small fry. Wasn't even a major CEO or anything. He was just a trader. Got only 2 years and 6 months in prison. It's a joke. And what banks got in return for destroying the world's economy? A bailout. Taxpayers basically paid for everything. That's why I invest in crypto. Because I know that the game is rigged against us the regular people.

Small people like me and you take the biggest hit every single time. We lose our savings, we lose our jobs while they are fine laughing and plotting another scheme to mess things up. Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) that brought the world's finance system to its knees in 2008 are being abused again by financial institutions, but this time banks call them Bespoke Tranche Opportunities (BTO). It's basically the same thing. They just changed the name. They haven't learned anything because nobody got punished last time.

  
They don't care about any of us. And I feel like crypto is the only way out for us. 

That's why self-custody is important. Don't trust exchanges, don't trust banks, don't trust corporations. Get yourself a good hardware wallet, or even a paper wallet but keep it safe. Don't share it with anyone. Do your due diligence and let's avoid another FTX disaster.",rootpl,102,40,0.79

My first bag was Stellar Lumens back in early 2020 and it basically hovered for the longest time and then eventually I sold to profit a few hundred dollars.  I really thought the project would grow huge and what is funny is the price per coin is currently not much higher than when I bought back then.

84,"Next Fed Interest Rate Hike in One Month, March 22",119xibm,"In December the Fed was happy with inflation changes and foresaw a modest 0.25% rate hike at the meeting in March. Things have changed in the past two months and inflation has crept up slightly from December. The economy has not slowed as much as they were hoping and keeps humming along. 

There are now [expectations the Fed will raise interest rates 0.5%-0.75%](Fed policymakers were nearly unanimous about a 25 basis points rate hike just weeks ago. But the inflation picture has become a lot more daunting). If they double or triple the rate hike that they announced this will likely have negative impacts on the financial markets. 

There is a solid chance that we could again see a decrease in institutional money going into crypto and a pull back on some of the crypto gains we have seen lately. Fortunately, crypto does not always follow the stock market. BTC typically has decent movement after the Fed releases their rate hikes, regardless of it being the same movement as the stock market.",pbjclimbing,50,5,0.63
85,Hardware wallets could provide the innovations that make DApps and app-chains a mass adopted success,119xi3m,"One of the biggest challenges facing blockchain is the lack of education around security. Private key and wallet security as it stands today, lacks the ease that is needed to make the next generation of blockchain applications go mainstream.

I had never heard of Ledger Stax, until I heard about it on an interview and it kinda clicked for me that it really isn’t all on protocols to innovate. One of the big items of innovation needed is ease of use for people who don’t want to take responsibility or don’t really comprehend the responsibility of private key management. Not to mention, UI in crypto isn’t particularly good compared to a cell phone. However wallet providers like MetaMask, Keplr or Cosmostation do have a very fair UI. But it’s still technical enough for people, that they may not want to get into Crypto due to the general confusion’s that happen regarding private keys. 

Mobile hot wallets like MetaMask mobile and Keplr mobile and Cosmostation, that are for cellphones are good to help UI, but security and education is a serious problem. Sim swaps happen. I personally know people who have taken screenshots of their private keys before, because they don’t realize that all it takes is for someone to hack your Apple ID, and next thing you know they have access to your crypto all because of a screenshot. 

Hardware wallets are what can take crypto to the next level. This level of adoptions would also add in the necessity for scalability that Cosmos’s app-chain thesis as well as Polkadots Parachains and Avalanches subnets, would be in a perfect position to capitalize in such a hardware wallet. While the wallet, provides the necessary abstractions to make it nearly unnoticeable what chain is actually being used.

Hardware wallets can add the security and UI/UX necessary, to make Crypto DApps and app-chains gain the usability to go mainstream. A hardware wallet that has UI/UX similar to something like an iPhone, is what it really takes. A hardware wallet will have an AppStore. Some of these apps will be Ethereum DApps or other DApps, but scalability will obviously be an issue, and IBC and the app-chain thesis could be a good solution, alongside parachain and subnet DApps.

Take it easy on me, honestly I’ve had my head buried deep in the actual software components of blockchain and have largely ignored the hardware. When I heard about Stax, and saw the concept, it blew my mind. Please chime in and let me know any other crypto hardware components I should look at, I feel like it’s hardwares turn to take us into mass adoption and I want to be ahead of the curve if I can.",Jcook_14,14,3,0.8
86,Most of us are in crypto mainly for money cause we are poor and poor people can't afford to not put money at 1st place.,119xeqp,"Only people that think money are not important and don't increase happiness are rich people. Yes money don't solve all problems, but they solve all problems that can be solved with money, so like 90% of them. Broken hearts or  all ideological discussions can't be healed or solved with money, but they doesn't matter when you have no roof over your head and bills to pay. Crypto is lifechanging for most of us, cause it can help  improve our living conditions. All rest is not that important and if you think privacy or tech are  much more important than money you probably live quite comfortable life.

Caring about tech, envirement, privacy and freedom is cool and fun if you have time and money for it. Most of us have neither, we are stuck in 9-5, eat shitty food, cause good food or going out to eat in restaurant is expensive, we have boring clothes we barely are able to pay rent. Not cause we want, just cause modern world is bad and to change our lives we need money. Throwing some noble causes and nice sounding slogans at people like us is disrespectful. If I will make money in crypto I will stop treating ""being profitable and safe"" as main thing, until then I  and most of us can't afford wasting time and effort on something that don't give us results.

Some coins like Monero or Nano have good tech behind them and also ideals like privacy. That's cool, but most of us won't buy them, cause they aren't profitable. I will chose Bitcoin all the times, cause even if BTC will do nothing it will still do better and be safer than them.

89,There is more to crypto than moonshots and sICk gAInZ,119w150,"I'm no saint. I like money. But I'd like to highlight some other benefits of crypto that I feel are often not talked about because of the volatility and exciting price movements. I mean a lot of us are here because we're interested in making money but beyond the financial gains, there are some other compelling reasons to invest in our favourite projects. Here are a few that come to mind:


Empowering the Unbanked: 

Cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide financial services to people who are currently excluded from the traditional banking system. According to the World Bank, around 1.7 billion people worldwide lack access to a bank account. By using cryptocurrencies, they can send and receive money, store value, and access other financial services without relying on a bank or government. This can help reduce poverty and increase economic participation.


Promoting Privacy: 

Several cryptocurrencies offer a high degree of privacy and anonymity in transactions. This can be important for people who want to keep their financial activities hidden from prying eyes, whether it's for personal or political reasons. Cryptocurrencies can also protect against government surveillance and censorship, which is particularly relevant in authoritarian regimes. Even though these coins might not provide financial gains or a good outlook on your investment, you could make a statement by holding or using them.


Encouraging Decentralization: 

One of the key features of cryptocurrencies is that they are decentralized, meaning they don't rely on a central authority to function. This can help promote more equitable and democratic systems by reducing the power of large institutions and individuals. Decentralized cryptocurrencies can also be more resistant to censorship, fraud, and other forms of manipulation.


Supporting Innovation: 

Crypto is still in their early stages, and there is a lot of room for innovation and experimentation. By investing in cryptocurrencies, you can support projects that are working on new and exciting ways to use blockchain technology. This can lead to advances in fields such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.

91,Is anyone not investing in BTC or ETH and only investing in shit coins?,119va2t,"Do you feel like you're already behind in the crypto game if you haven't invested in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)? According to my experience, these two coins are the main players in the market, and if you're not putting at least a small amount into them, you're probably not that interested in crypto.

Personally, I'm all-in on ETH at the moment, but I still think BTC is the safer bet. BTC has always been the king of crypto, and I believe it will continue to hold that position. However, ETH is currently ahead of any other Layer 1 (L1) blockchains, although there's always room for improvement.

That said, I'm also keeping an eye on other L1s that could potentially take over ETH's second place if they offer faster and cheaper transactions without relying on Layer 2 (L2) solutions.

But wait, there's more! While my portfolio is mostly composed of major coins like MATIC, ADA, and CRO, I'm also keeping a few small market-cap coins for potential moon shots. I'm curious, though: are any of you investing purely in ""shitcoins""? What makes you choose them over the ""safer"" bets like BTC and ETH?

This subreddit gets mentioned a lot for giving out terrible advise and how doing the exact opposite is actually the best way of going about it.

This might be true for some of you but for me it really helped me A LOT.

&#x200B;

I found this subreddit nearly 2 years ago and it actually changed my life.

I used to be always broke and actually terrible at managing money.

&#x200B;

Drunken poker sessions tilting it all away? Check.

Spending too much money on weed, booze and other drugs? Check.

Spending way too much on magic cards? Check.

Going to the clubs not caring about how much I would spend? Check.

As you can tell I was just the worst.

But then I found r/cryptocurrency

At first I was like - 'yea let's buy some of this crypto, I also want to be rich and fuck knows I 'need' the money'

But then I started reading more and more and seeing how patient, logical and responsible some of you are it made me realise what an idiot I was.

&#x200B;

So what changed you ask? A LOT.

&#x200B;

**Security:**

I used to just download whatever I'd like on to my PC without a care in the world.

I knew my email was hacked but just did not care.

I had like 2 passwords for everything ( and they we're very similar  )

Now I have a separate clean laptop just for crypto.

Now I have 2FA on everything.

Now I use a password manager.

Recently bought a hardware wallet!

&#x200B;

**Money management:**

As I said I was always broke spending without any regard for the future. Now I am saving a decent chunk of my income each month and have strict DCA days.

I track my expenses and think about ways to save more money and spend smarter.

No more poker ( I am terrible at it anyway )

Quit magic ( it's dying anyway )

**Health:**

I stopped smoking completely and drink about every other weekend.

Started working out and feel just so much better.

[Coingecko: OKB's market cap $13B](https://preview.redd.it/7ructsx6kwja1.png?width=1283&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b41a5065102ec14c3c00e758036022bce6cb08fe)

However, on coinmarketcap, OKB is ranked 52, with a way different market cap shown.

The difference is that Coingecko has OKB's circulating supply at 236 million, while CMC has it locked at 60 million. I suppose Coingecko's starts are more accurate.

The weird thing is that when you go back a year in coinmarketcap's database, OKB coin was ranked 72, with the same listed supply.

It's been a whole year. **The coin has risen 200%** and cmc just never changed its supply? Which one is the correct one? Also, the fact that the supply keeps changing is weird enough but whatever, centralised exchanges can do whatever they want with their tokens. 

It's sketchy enough that cmc has been biased towards a certain centralised exchange for years now but that's beyond the purpose of this post.

**The fact that OKB has risen so quickly and entered the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap sketches me out honestly.** I still don't trust centralised exchanges and neither should you.

104,Truth about mining helping to stabilize the power grid,119pydq,"Power grids typically connect multiple power plants to customers across a wide area. To ensure safe and proper operation, the voltage, frequency, and other electrical characteristics of the grid must be maintained within specific ranges. And this is very tough to achieve.

 If these parameters go out of range, the grid could become unstable, producing effects that impact or damage equipment on the power network. One effect. When the amount of power on the grid exceeds demand, its operating voltage can increase, creating a reverse power effect that can damage power generation equipment in utility power plants.

Challenges of electricity generation are balancing supply and demand in real-time. Electricity supply must match demand at all times, and if there is too much supply or too little demand, it can cause instability in the power grid.

This can usually be solved by shutting down generating stations, but it isn't as easy as it looks to throttle back or shut down the power stations.

There is a potential for Bitcoin mining to help stabilize the power grid, but it depends on the specifics of the situation.

Bitcoin mining can help stabilize the power grid by providing a flexible demand for electricity. Mining operations can be turned on or off quickly, depending on the availability and cost of electricity. When there is excess electricity supply, Bitcoin miners can use it to mine Bitcoin, which can help balance the grid and prevent energy waste.

Furthermore, Bitcoin mining can help make use of energy sources that might otherwise go to waste. For example, some mining operations use energy generated by wind turbines or solar panels that would otherwise be wasted because they cannot be stored.

In Texas for example, wind generators had to be turned off to prevent overload, this could instead have been used to mine BTC, which would profit both the state and the miners.

Most of us have dirty wallets. You very likely have contracts with unlimited token allowance. Legitimate project or not, this is a risk.

[Revoke.cash](https://Revoke.cash) is one of crypto's best security tools. And it's available for free.

Revoke eliminates most of your wallet's attack surface. Please indulge me while I share its best features with you.

[Revoke prevented user's wallet from being drained](https://preview.redd.it/chgpjyrtxtja1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af6591bc64a3c5a4d32943bcf11ed71a981fbd38)

# CLEAN YOUR DIRTY WALLET

❶ Make note of each network you transact on. Revoke works with most of the major chains.

&#x200B;

❷ Visit [https://revoke.cash](https://t.co/pxVHiQy7hF)

Revoke was released in 2019. It's highly reputable and [Metamask recommends it](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4446106184731-How-to-revoke-smart-contract-allowances-token-approvals) for this purpose.  I've used different token allowance platforms. Revoke is fast, simple, & accurate.

&#x200B;

❸ Connect your wallet and perform an allowance check by toggling between:

* Tokens
* NFTs

Use the drop down menu (*top center*) and check each network you regularly connect to.

&#x200B;

❹ If this is your first allowance check, expect a dirty wallet.

But before you revoke an unrecognized contract:

* Run it on Etherscan. It may be legit and you simply forgot.
* Revoke contracts you don't recall or ID on Etherscan

⚠️ **Revoking a token allowance incurs a Metamask transaction. It's about $1.**

&#x200B;

❺ Bookmark the URL and schedule this task at least once monthly.  You should always know who has access to your crypto.

&#x200B;

# EXTENSION

Download Revoke's extension if you're lazy. That's what I did.  This screen cap shows the extension's primary functions.

[Revoke Extension](https://preview.redd.it/580401d64uja1.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9311e016ca8af68d40b73088d2bc35950cb0675a)

&#x200B;

Revoke's extension appears ahead of Metamask. It offers a transaction detail in plain language. Metamask window appears only after you select **continue**.

*BTW, Fire App & Blockfence are excellent security tools themselves. I use them in combination with Revoke. Fire App runs a simulated txn (dry run) and presents the results before you confirm the txn. Never risk your assets. Blockfence uses ChatGPT to examine the contract. It also presents pre-signature results. Please expect a separate Reddit post on those 2 resources tonight.*

&#x200B;

Please make a habit to check your contract allowances at least once monthly. Nobody but you should have unlimited access to your crypto & NFTs.

Best of luck to you.🙏🏻

But this will have to change with Reddit going IPO, to satisfy wallstreet they will have to monetize the platform more! How?

Reddit has already a plan for that - **Moons and Reddit Community Points through changing their entire business model**

**We have now seen with Banner that users do like ads, if they make profit from it. By creating and seizing the value of their contributions through Moons, it's US who can profit from ads targeted at US!**

But what about Reddit?

It's an entirely new business model! **Subreddits as Media Companies and Marketplace Trading Avatars. Reddit will act as a housing entity, taking their cuts in economy that will form!**

Reddit will use this model to storm the web3, satisfy wallstreet and ultimately create an entirely new business model for others to follow.

* **Moons core fundamentals and intangibles**

How did it all start? Is it with [this Vitalik's comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/14w2wo/come_get_some_free_bitcoins/c7gztw3/?context=1) on Reddit?

https://preview.redd.it/jzz30y1iatja1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0a28f12b837d23bde065d9cd44d199aad0d0ed4b

No. Let's go further back for a minute

Back in 17th century Europeans traded with New England Natives, but the natives didn't use silver or gold, they used durable skeleton parts of their pray. Mostly sea-shell money - wampum, strung onto pedants. Wampump that spread far away from clam's habitat into other tribes. They also used teeth, furs, made artful blades and necklessess. Blades that weren't made for cutting but for sheer enjoyment. Collecting and decorating things originates all back to Africa. People like doing things for fun, it's irrational and not practical but we do it. We trade with it or pass it to our children. Like some animals, humans learned that non-kin altruism grew community stronger and put trust in it's members but people can only track a certain number of people.  

**Internet and now social apps let us scale much more.**

Just like primitive people's traditional craftmanship and folklore, nowadays there is huge number of intangible things that people find value in. Supporting your football club, company's logos branding, memorabilia, deep feeling for you country and dying for beliefs. **Moons and broader Avatars, represent more then lines of code and can spread much further from our community.** 

 We put our emotions, thoughts and feelings into our contributions and grow our community . Tipping makes our community stronger. Moons represent our journey and place in the community. **This fundamental idea that you can capture and store value created by your contributions to the Community is a new paradigm in using social apps.** Moons are proof that you own that something.

**Reddit's idea to decentralize the platform and give us this freedom to transact the wealth generated by our digital identities is unique in social app sphere and will change the very underlying fabric of social apps.** 

$1 Moons with only like $100m mcap is safe to say will be just the beginning. Big exchanges listings, hype and media that will follow will bring huge influx of new people lining up to join us, earn Moons and we will grow, change and work things out together.

**Moons are special and we are just getting started!**

120,If there was an annual /cc convention - would you go?,119gr3u,"I saw a comment earlier from a bloke who said he had made many great friends on this subreddit, both in and outside of his country. Very heartwarming, to say the least.

That got me thinking.. what if there was an annual /cc con, where members of the sub far and wide could congregate and befriend each other in real life? Would you go to such an event? 

Of course, such an event would open up many potential use-cases of our beloved Moons.. there could be a moon 50/50, merchants accepting Moons, a moon arcade, the options are endless.

Do you think we would become one big happy family, or would things quickly escalate into all-out war between shills?

Since there was a large community outcry against community points, [The subreddit voted](https://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/a1l8fu/should_we_as_the_entire_subreddit_opt_of_this/) on **November 29th 2018** **12:46 PM PST** and the vote passed the decision threshold to remove Community Points from the subreddit.

A couple of days later **December 1st 2018 12:27PM** after this vote there were multiple posts about the [admins having lied, blindsided the mods & the subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/a21e9n/the_admins_lied_our_mods_did_not_approve_the/), that they were replacing mods with reddit admins, and one of the mods claiming that the admins did this without consent. It turned out however, that the admins **DID** speak to the mods... just not that one in question, so they assumed it had been implemented by the admins without asking.

&#x200B;

[Admins Lied??](https://preview.redd.it/93m0g6zqjtja1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7aa2811355cce4e0efb29726e9a2a02332600bd6)

A few hours after this (**December 1st 2018, 3:19pm)** the admin posts [This update](https://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/a27zee/update_on_community_points_in_rlibertarian/) explaining why they added community points and to see how the community would react, they also reiterated how they did have consent and contact with the subreddit mods, proving a small timeline. Finally, they announced they would be honoring the result of the poll to turn off RCPs, and with a small update on **December 3rd 2018**, RCPs were no more on their subreddit.

So that's it right? Well... no. There was a post on the same day the Community points were turn off (**Dec 3rd**) by one of the main mods in which he announced [he would be stepping down](https://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/a2ujrx/i_am_stepping_down_from_the_rlibertarian_mod_team/) due to the backlash and basically called out the two head mods for being completely inactive.

&#x200B;

There are a few other examples of RCPs being implemented into subreddits not exactly suited for them and not working out, but in my opinion, this was the most interesting one and a very important chapter in the history of Reddit Community Points.

**TL;DR Timeline (PST)**

**11/29/18: 11:29AM** \- Reddit Community points introduced to r/Libertarian.

**11/29/18: 12:46PM** \- Vote opened to remove ommunity points, had very high % of users voting to remove them (I believe around 91% at one point)/

**12/01/18: 12:27PM** \- Accusations about lying from admins, one mod claiming they are trying to replace them and added them without consent. (proved to be false)

**12/01/18: 3:19PM** \- Admin posts update saying they will remove RCPs from the subreddit

**12/03/18: ??** \- Reddit Community Points turned off for r/Libertarian

**12/03/18: 3:30PM** \- One of the primary mods who agreed to adding community points steps down and points fingers at head admins for doing very little.",step11234,40,10,0.72
122,LEDN.IO wants more of your BTC in exchange for a lower loan rate,119gmgj,"I'm still a ""customer"" even though I withdrew all my crypto from these folks in mid 2022 before all the drama started.

Yesterday, they sent out this hilarious email as a ""new product"" announcement:

***NEW! Low Interest Loans - Bitcoin backed loans with interest rates as low as 3.9% APR.\****

*Do you have more bitcoin available for collateral in exchange for a lower interest rate? Then this product is perfect for you. Coming soon, Ledn will launch a beta of our new Low Interest Loans. Our in-platform calculator can help you understand what collateral is required for varying interest rates. This is a beta, so increased functionality will roll out over time and we welcome your feedback on how to improve and evolve the product. Low Interest Loans are available based on jurisdiction and loan eligibility. We may also need to start a waitlist depending on demand as capacity will be limited to start.*  

*Don’t worry - our typical bitcoin-backed loans at a 50% LTV are still available as is!*

I think this deserves the ""comedy"" flair even if they seem quite earnest.

Q: How many people, having seen this company lock withdrawals and OTHER companies (ahem BlockFi) lose their staked crypto, are willing to stake with them crypto just to borrow cash at this low a rate with a non-zero possibility of 2x the value in BTC disappearing overnight?

I understand the overall usecase for borrowing against crypto (need fiat with a non-taxable event b/c you have such a low cost basis) but juicing up your collateral seems pretty nuts to me.

126,Will China break the cycle,119fpu7,"**Perhaps many of us here now in r/cc might still remember the allmighty bullrun of 2021 where everything and everybody was bullish, even your grandma and hairdresser were shilling some memecoins..** 

That euforia ended in May 2021 when we entered a temporary shitstorm when China decided to **ban** Bitcoin mining. (The price of Bitcoin was around the $55,000 Dollars)

*During that time of uncertainty Bitcoin's total hash rate dropped from more than 150 Eh/s to 100 Eh/s.* 

Bitcoin's current hashrate is sitting around 325 Eh/s. 

[current Hashrate here](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate#:~:text=Basic%20Info,90.09%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago) 

Recently it became known that Hong Kong outlined a plan to let retail investors trade digital tokens like Bitcoin and Ether, taking a major step toward its goal of becoming a Crypto hub in a policy shift that contrasts with a crackdown in the US. 

**This however seems familiar with the recent ban on Crypto, still if my memory serves me right, it's not the first time China banned Crypto, it happened before.** 

# 2013:


In 2013 Bitcoin became so widespread in China that many businesses began accepting it as payment. 

*Fun fact: the country's largest search engine accounced it welcomed BTC payments in 2013.* 

2013 also marked China's first attempt to put the brakes on Bitcoin trading. The 'People's Bank of China (PBC)' issued new rules regarding crypto transactions at financial institutions, according to which Chinese banks could no longer hold or transact in virtual currencies like BTC. 

This first BTC ban didn't make it illegal for Chinese citizens to buy, store, or send crypto. However, the PBC made accessing crypto from exchanges like Bitcoin China more challenging. 

# 2017:


During the 2017 crypto bull market, Chinese officials put increased sanctions on crypto trading. Instead of focusing on bank transfers or mining, officials were concerced with 'ICO's' (Initial Coin Offerings) which are digital tokens meant to represent an ownership stake in a new Crypto project. 

To get rid of the booming ICO's, China decided to ban all platforms offerings said ICO's. 

China also forced many CEX's to cease operations. During this time multiple Exchanges changed their name and relocated their headquarters to other countries. 

# 2021:


China already considered banning Bitcoin mining in 2019, but it wasn't until 2021 when Bitcoin ($55,000 at the time) was blasting through ATH's officials imposed severe restrictions on the sector. 

**Along with the mining ban, China outlawed all Crypto trading and transactions later that year. Presently, anyone who works for a Chinese tech firm associated with crypto can face jail time.** 

Fast forward with the recent news that China is allowing Hong Kong to buy Crypto again, we can't deny that there is a pattern here.

The timelines above make me wonder if history will repeat itself and if China will break the ban / unban cycle.

**So with that said:**

According to this bear market they have been not so smart while accumulating…,119dcoq,"I‘d guess that about 90% of members on this sub are either shrimps (less than 1BTC) or crabs (1 to 10BTC) when it comes to Bitcoin holdings. And another observation is that many here “care“ a lot about how Whales (over 1k BTC) trade and when whales buy or sell. This is mostly due to the understanding that whales are older players in Crypto and can thus predict a bear market and bull market much better than us.

This is not really true. While there are some whales that have a quite good knowledge about the markets, they are the very minority. Especially during this bear market we could see that those rich Whales do not know anything more than us about the markets and have been wrong a couple of times.

&#x200B;

This chart shows the amount of Whale addresses, an increase can be associated with prior Whales buying more (Whales usually spread their holdings over multiple addresses) or even new big players entering the markets. In the past this metric usually increased a lot during a bear market, showing the smart accumulation by whales while other people shit themselves.

This time it was different, Whales did start to accumulate but during the wrong time as most of us here did too. They were buying at $35k levels during early 2022 and now they have been selling or exiting the markets at even lower prices as the amount of Whales just keeps decreasing.

This could be the effect of institutions entering Crypto and not really knowing when to buy or sell but just throwing money but also the effect of Whales miss-timing the markets just as us all.",partymsl,182,73,0.86

One user, u/C01n_sh1LL, said this about crypto news media in general:

>The others are *all* either aggregators running largely on automation or third world labor, stealing content for clicks, or are paid under the table by shadier players to shill their interests.

B: CoinTelegraph, Benzinga and r/CryptoCurrency got most negative mentions

If there is no information regarding this, then I ask you all, do you think that this will have an impact on the current moons distribution? I'm completely in the dark so I've no opinion to offer regarding this, but I certainly would love to read what you all think!


Edit: Woah this got far more replies than I had hoped! Thank you to everyone who replied, I'm reading through all of your comments now 😊

Edit 2: Thanks for all the responses! Figured I'd do another edit instead of responding individually to save myself some time. There seems to be a lot of mixed feelings regarding the IPO. I guess it all comes down to what type of asset the SEC would classify moons to be. I'm hoping nothing changes too drastically as my experience so far in this subreddit, as well as many more different subs, has been fantastic. So many different walks of life with differing opinions, it's fantastic!

Thanks again to everyone who responded to this post, I very much appreciate the knowledge you all have sent my way 😊",One_Ad_5059,86,7,0.62
138,The Redditverse: A Place Where Crypto Community Tokens Form The Basis of The Reddit Economy.,119av72,"Last night, I went to sleep thinking about Reddit and Community tokens, and woke up with this idea: the creation of a Reddit Metaverse where Community Tokens form the basis of the economy.

# 🌈The Redditverse: A Place Where Redditors Decide the Future Driven by Community Tokens 🌈

[The Redditverse: The promised land](https://preview.redd.it/zb8n2p8i3pja1.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=84faa68f26f8f4482f83e940c72f810cdc842599)

# 🌇Structure of the Redditverse 🌆

* **Central City:** This place will serve as the main stage and welcome new and old Redditors, where they can use their Community Tokens to purchase items, land, etc. or buy Community Tokens with fiat or convert one Community Token to another.
* **Towns:** This places will be an specific space for each Reddit Community sub where only the official Community Token can be used to purchase things inside that space or another token decided by Governance polls in those specific subs.

# 🗳 Governance System 🗳

There will be two main types of polls.

* **Central City polls:** Every Redditor (only one account allowed) can vote to decide the future or the Redditverse.
* **Town polls:** Only Redditors from that specific sub can vote.

**Examples of polls:**

* Decide if a big company or retail investors are allowed to buy land in the Central City or in Towns.
* Governances to decide if add a new secondary Community Token or which Community Token will be the main one (There are subs without tokens so they would have to adopt one).

This governance system can be improved a lot but I think it can be a good start. Maybe it would be interesting to have a Committee per sub decided by Governance polls per X time to make things more manageable. This idea is somehow like the real world system .

# 💼 External companies integration 💼

Companies would be interested in buying lands here because Reddit is a huge community and it would be a direct link to them but we don't have to forget about small businesses so that is the reason why we should find a way to make them pay different amounts depending on the incomes they have. **For example:** Mc Donalds would pay a lot more than My aunt's tech shop.

# 💇‍♂️Customizable Avatars 💇‍♀️

The Redditverse world theme would be exactly the same as the images where users would be their 3D Reddit avatars NFTs or not.

140,What comes for Ethereum post-Shanghai hardfork? The Cancun hardfork which will include the much anticipated EIP-4844!,119agw1,"Ethereum investors and the crypto community are waiting for Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade to be released mid-March as long as the testnet deployments succeed and will finally allow staking withdrawals.

The next hardfork to follow will be called Cancun and will most likely contain EIP-4844!

What is EIP-4844?

EIP-4844 is an upcoming Ethereum upgrade that introduces Proto-Danksharding to the blockchain, which adds blobs of data, which is the first step towards full Ethereum sharding, enabling rollups on Ethereum to grow their throughout 100x in capacity. 

What are the benefits of EIP-4844?

- Reduces gas fees: Improves scalability by adding roughly 2 MB worth of space to Ethereum roll-up blocks as a stop-gap solution to relieve the network from high gas fees - users and the network will feel this change as the gas fees will get lower
- Accelerate sharding implementation: Introduces the format for sharded data without actually sharding it, thus creating a new ""blob-carrying transaction"" type.
The format will be identical to full sharding and thereby will minimize the effort needed for full sharding implementation in the future

I think it is more or less a given that these big tech and fraud stories tend to hit the screens rather often and crypto is pretty much the perfect intersection of both worlds.

They both seem to unite all of the bizarre and over-the-top aspects we've come to expect of irresponsible people with unholy amounts of money.

I would like to know, though, which story would you beautiful band of people rather see in the silver screen?

Personally, I think SBF hits as movie-worthy material. The way the guy gamed public opinion with the ""good-rich-guy"" act, involved famous names to push his racket, and his ties with some pretty big people in power sounds as the more interesting story.

The tool would allow you to create custom signals by combining a multitude of sources (indicators, volatility and even social media analysis in the future).

We've also added a leaderboard where you can see as well as clone all public top performing configurations. We have a big social focus on Aesir, and we want everyone to share the knowledge with others.

145,Safeguarding Newcomers from Scams During the Forthcoming Crypto Bull Run,1198dhz,"Greetings, fellow crypto enthusiasts,

As we brace ourselves for another bull market, it's essential to remain alert and protect novice investors from frauds, deceptions, and pump-and-dump plots that are bound to arise. As a community, it's our responsibility to ensure that new investors are not exploited by dishonest entities who aim to make money by taking advantage of their lack of knowledge.

During the previous bull market, we witnessed numerous new investors become victims of scams and swindles that promised fast profits but ultimately left them penniless. As the price of cryptocurrencies surged, the number of fraudulent activities escalated, and many people were left feeling disheartened and discouraged.

We cannot afford to let this happen again. We need to be proactive in safeguarding newcomers from becoming prey to these unscrupulous entities. We need to enlighten them about the dangers and risks of investing in cryptocurrencies and assist them in navigating the sometimes perplexing and overwhelming digital currency landscape.

Let's take a pledge to protect newcomers during the upcoming bull market. Let's foster an inviting and supportive community that helps individuals make informed investment decisions. Let's report any dubious activities and expose dishonest actors who aim to capitalize on people's lack of knowledge.

Together, we can make the crypto world a safer and more welcoming place for everyone.",m_a_lfunction,47,12,0.74

150,Eth from launch to top 10,119673j,"Recently I had been curious about Dogecoins ascension to the Top 10 by market cap. It was a wild phenomena that a coin was created out of nowhere, with no VC funding or anything, just as a joke. Dogecoin in 15 days had made it to the 13th spot and in 43 days from its creation it was a top 10 coin.

Now looking at Ethereum, it's a whole other thing. There was planning, whitepapers and much more that went into the creation of the Ethereum Blockchain.  
It was initially idealized in late 2013 and announced (not launched) in January 2014. Then a lot of work was put into is, since it wasn't just a joke meme coin like Dogecoin, so there was actual investment and development behind the coin.

Officially it was launched on July 30, 2015. Some sources put the launch price at $0.43 and others $0.31.

On coinmarketcap it's historical data begins on August 7, 2015 (8 days after launch) with a price of $2.83 then by the next day the Market Cap was factored in, the price dropped sharply but it was already at $ 80,339,475 which put it firmly between the Top 10 coins.

We transferred a percentage of our kids' saving accounts to BTC and then immediately to cold storage. (A wallet for each of them)

My kids are young and won't have a need for any money (outside of wanting to buy their own toys or whatever) for at least 10 years or so.

I figured out what the money would be worth if we kept it in their existing savings account and told my wife that her and I could ""insure"" it for lack of a better term. If the BTC we bought from their savings isn't worth that amount in 10 years, we would make up the difference in cash back to them at that point. 

Once they are a little older and understand risk / investing / inflation / etc, they'll be able to make their own contributions at that point. (if they want, once they are old enough, if they want to pull it all out and put it into cash, I'll do that too). However, I won't ""insure"" their contributions, just the initial investment I made.

156,"In addition to cryptocurrencies, what other asset do you consider essential in your portfolio?",11954yp,"Diversification is a strategy of spreading investments across multiple assets in order to reduce risk and maximize returns. It is a fundamental principle of sound investment management and is considered to be one of the most effective ways to mitigate investment risk.

The importance of diversification lies in the fact that it can help to minimize the impact of any single asset on the overall portfolio. By investing in multiple assets that have a low correlation with one another, an investor can potentially reduce the overall risk of the portfolio without necessarily sacrificing returns.

Additionally, diversification can also help to protect against the volatility of the market. By investing in assets with different risk profiles, investors can create a more stable portfolio that is less likely to experience significant losses during market downturns.

Overall, diversification is a critical component of a successful investment strategy. By spreading investments across multiple assets, investors can help to minimize risk and maximize returns over the long term.

* **ETH** maintains the overall lead, followed by second place **BTC** in second place, the only two cryptos in the green since January 2018.

## January Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/7eh9cn6atrja1.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=522c74407817937653270bd3a494ea75e55e4d41

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** sixty-one months into the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the 2018 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Tether, BNB, MATIC, USDC, BUSD,** and **DOGE.**

**NEM** is the first of the 2018 Top Ten to drop out of the Top 100 and has the distinction of being the lowest ranked crypto of any of the six Experiments.

## January Winners and Losers

***January Winners*** – **ADA** easily won the month (+55%) followed by **DASH** (+43%).  

***January Losers*** – **XRP** and **Stellar** had the “worst” month, +24% and +25% respectively.

## Overall Update –   ETH maintains first place, followed by BTC. NEM in last place, slipping out of the Top 100.

After over five years of holding these cryptos, only 2 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC** and **ETH.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+119%) is ahead of the pack, followed by second place **BTC** (+75%).

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** five years ago?  It’s worth $220 today.

**NEM** is at the bottom, down -96% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in **Dash** sixty-one months ago is worth $4 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/kwo7frgbtrja1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce6dd833b4b826c2fe1d1d44e69444aec2822079

End of January 2023 market cap: **$1,048,821,167,396**

In contrast to the performance of the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio, Crypto as a sector is up +82% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but ***if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (-44%)***.  You would also be significantly outperforming the return of the S&P (+50%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum**).

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/kv7gvaoctrja1.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bf65aa54c89753a2625ac14ed448f02e0fa05332

**BitDom** ended January at 42.5%.  When considering the more than five year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/sopt0p1etrja1.png?width=337&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=77cf447a1ef9f869902b2b32481817fb4e87f562

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $562**, -44% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

For context, in sixty-one months since the start of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, forty-eight months have been in the red, with only thirteen months of green (all which occurred in 2021/22). 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment over 5 years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/a6je835ftrja1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b4a2659b9718f0c630b856756e465661c97248c7

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

A reminder: ***no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.***  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 into each of the ***2019***, ***2020, 2021,*** ***2022, and 2023*** Top Tens as well.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-61): down -44% (total value $562)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +192% (total value $2,915)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +354% (total value $4,541) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +82% (total value $1,822)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -72% (total value $284) (***worst performing portfolio****)*
* [2023 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +33% (total value $1,329)

So overall? Taking the six portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $6,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$11,453.** 

**That’s up +92%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**November’s all time high of +553%**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47). Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/8ed6x5cgtrja1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=010838c294445be24902bfbd56cebd8ebf79a0d6

***That’s a +92% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  

https://preview.redd.it/10zd57hhtrja1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0686591bfe8e290740f8f76bb57fdf7ecf84fc1f

The S&P 500 is up +50% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,500 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,500 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,600 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,240 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,070 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $840 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,050 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After six $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,300.**

That is up **+22%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+92%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

The chart below shows the six year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

Many thanks to the long-time Experiment followers, appreciate you taking the time to follow along over the years.  For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow give you a taste of what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to enjoy the ride!

A reporting note: I’ll focus on [2023 Top Ten Portfolio reports](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1) \+ one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  January’s extended report is on the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio (the OG Experiment), which you’re reading now.

158,How to provide liquidity on Sushi swap- A step-by-step guide,1194syr,"As many are aware, CCIP-051 is giving a bonus to liquidity providers in the ETH-MOON pool.  Adding liquidity can be a useful way to gain some passive crypto (but be sure to read up on LP risks before providing liquidity).

For the purpose of this post, I'm not going to go into the pros and cons, risks and benefits of LP.  I'm going to assume that if you're looking to provide LP, you've done your research and due diligence and have decided to provide liquidity.   I will also assume you've imported your vault to metamask and added the arbitrum nova network.  If you need help with that, you can read this thread first- [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/y4qs5p/do\_you\_still\_have\_some\_trouble\_to\_import\_your/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/y4qs5p/do_you_still_have_some_trouble_to_import_your/)

Here's how you provide the liquidity:

1. Make sure you have some ETH on arbitrum. If you need some, go to [https://novafaucet.com/](https://novafaucet.com/) or bridge ETH to Arbitrum nova via [orbiter.finance](https://orbiter.finance) or [https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42170](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42170)
2. Go to [https://www.sushi.com/earn/add](https://www.sushi.com/earn/add)
3. Connect your metamask to sushi (make sure you are on the Arbitrum nova network).  


[Notice the network is the Nova network- It is Ethereum network by default](https://preview.redd.it/yth228udrrja1.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6f799f4ee588cb87cef15fcaf6e9e1aae30bc3ba)

4. Select the Nova Network, Classic, 0.30% fee tier, and ETH and MOON as the option. Enter either the amount of MOON or ETH you want to put in liquidity. The other amount will auto-populate (at the time of writing, it is \~1000 moons: 0.1 ETH).  

I'd recommend not going above 25% of your earned moons, otherwise you will face a KM punishment.  Additionally, you can swap moons for ETH. If doing this option, I recommend only swapping 12.5% of your moons for ETH, and providing 12.5% to liquidity to stay under the 25% threshold.

5. Select ""Add Liquidity"", then ""Add"", and sign the transaction in metamask.

160,Efficient Market Hypothesis – the theory that you don’t know shit,1194998,"The efficient market hypothesis is the belief that all known information is already priced into a stock or crypto. Especially with high volume crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum, even something like Doge, the fair price has already been discovered. It takes new information to move the price. Inflation comes in lower than expected, that’s new information, crypto goes up and the market remains efficient.


Why does this theory matter? If you are Dollar Cost Averaging you are already following this theory. Just keep buying in over time because you are buying at a fair market price. You don’t have any additional information that the market doesn’t already know so don’t even try to time the market. Even fundamental or technical analysis are not worth your time if you follow this theory. Just keep buying.


A new shitcoin that just came out that has already pumped 500%... maybe take a pause and think it over. In general though, if you follow the efficient market hypothesis you can assume it’s always a good time to buy in. Even if you added at the peak of the 2021 mania, that was the fair market price at the time so don’t kick yourself for it.

This year was different though. I made a lot of NFT sales this past year and after wading through the 1000s of transactions my brain went to goo. I wasn’t able to reconcile all my transactions. Especially the one’s coming from niche exchanges that don’t even have transaction export’s available. I filed anyway. 

Anyone have any experience with an IRS? 

I feel confident that i can demonstrate that i filed in good faith but I don’t think being inept is a solid defense. I’ve used programs like coin tracker but those have severe limitations when it comes to the crypto gaming space. 

What is the worst that could happen?

Could i just pay a fine and be done with it?

Even if the IRS accepts this year could I be screwing myself down the line if i am inaccurate in my filing this year?

Please talk me off the ledge. There is no way i can track all the buys/sells/rewards/transfers/etc. 

How can you even calculate something like this for taxes. 

Purchase 10 packs of NFT trading card packs. 1 card is worth $1000 but the others are all worth $.20. I combine all 49 the other .20 cards to create 5 cards that are all worth 2. Then i sell those cards to get in game coin and i purchase potions that improves the odds of opening better cards in future pack purchases. I buy one more pack and i get another $1000 card. 

My theory is that all of that is irrelevant. The IRS just needs to know that i spent $100 usd on nfts and eventually i sold them and got $2000 usd back. 

Well thats what i tried to do and turbo tax and all other programs are firing up all these error messages saying that there are missing transactions. 

And thats an easy example. What about card rental income. Those transactions happen in the millions and millions.

167,"Many people here say that we are in a bull market, but this is not a bull market - at least not yet",119143v,"A common view here is that we are now in a bull market. This is stated frequently in the Daily General Discussion post, for instance.

Coinbase defines bull and bear markets as follows: *“Markets experiencing sustained and/or substantial growth are called bull markets. Markets experiencing sustained and/or substantial declines are called bear markets”.*

To put it in simple terms, a bull market is a rising market, while a bear market is a declining one. **For a bull market to be called, we need substantial upward swings over a long period of time.** Let's evaluate both.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Substantial upward swings? Maybe, but probably not

One could argue that we had a substantial upward swing. This is the key argument of the bull market callers, as they state that Bitcoin rallied a little over 50% from the lows.

Yet this swing is still rather 'mediocre'. Bitcoin is 65% down from all time high *and* currently under the 200-week moving average. From a historical perspective, that is still deep within bear territory. Moreover, it was really one big move, and not multiple upward swings, although that is arguable.

# Longer period of time? Nope, not yet!

But to say that we have had substantial upward swings *over a longer period of time* would be overstating the current rise of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is only working on its second green month in a row. Bitcoin would need a lot of follow through over a longer period to officially be in a bull market.

Remember, during a typical bear market, 50%+ pumps are very common. Take the fall from December 2017 to the low December 2018 as an example. We saw five pumps of 40% or more. The three largest were in order of time: 54%, 100%, and 55%.

&#x200B;

And those pumps were all made before we finally reached the bear market bottom. During the current bear market, this is only our first 50%+ pump as 2022 has been particularly brutal. This is why bull/bear charts look like this:

**We have had a bullish impulse, but we would need to see lots of follow through over a longer period of time to be in a bull market.** This period MIGHT be the start of a new bull market and eventually be counted as part of the bull, but it could also be a mere rally in a bear market that lasts longer. Time will tell.

The day you really need Bitcoin to deal with the flaws in the current system, then you'll have a hard time getting it...

Do you doubt what I am saying?

Look at Nigeria or Lebanon.

The people in Lebanon are suffering a thousand words from the disastrous decisions of corrupt politicians that have caused hyperinflation of the local currency for years. While the people want to recover the fruits of their labor, the banks block withdrawals.

You read that right!

The Lebanese cannot access the fruits of their labor. Their money, but placed within the banking system. As a result, this money only belongs to them under certain arbitrary conditions decided by the Banksters.

Their money no longer belongs to them.

This is a problem that the Bitcoin system solves. The fruits of your labor placed within the Bitcoin system really do belong to you once you have the private keys to your BTC in your possession.

No one can stop you from using it as you wish. No one can take it away from you. You have the power over the fruits of your labor.

Look beyond your Western comfort zone, and you'll see why it's in your best interest to save the fruits of your labor in Bitcoin before it becomes a necessity for you.

170,"How Crypto will change your life, as of today.",118wzs7,"Hey guys, 

Just wanted to add another perspective, whilst we gear emphatically towards another bustling bull market after the bear. 

I have been in, benefitted from and have been buying crypto since 2017. In that time I have accumulated, made profit, made loss. However, one thing has been constant... I have never ever had to rely on any bank or human for money ever again when I've been low.

The harsh, horrible reality is that we live in a rat race and our society is structured in a way which encourages earning money and almost amazingly instantly spending it. We will all be working 9-5s for a lot of our life. But crypto should be seen as a bestfriend in times of need. Put money in, and just forget about it, until one day you'll need some cash and it'll be right there. Its a rainy day fund, a holiday fund, a friend in times of joy and happiness

Hi guys Good Morning!

Does anyone have a breakdown of all the available on ramps and their fees? Searching online is a massive headache, all threads are a few years old, YT videos are full of waffle and most articles are very biased to most likely a sponsored application.

A Google Doc or table with all the relevant Fiat-USDT fees / the wait times would be amazing. Also transfer fees to a wallet would be a bonus!

Moonpay isn't great. Coinbase charges insane fees, so does Kraken and every other centralised exchange. Don't get me started on etoro that's a no go in my opinion.

174,Why cryptocurrencies can change the life of developing countries users (using eggs as an example).,118vb7b,"Greetings from Portugal.

The most innovative aspect of cryptocurrency, in my opinion, is how it allows for direct value transfers between people without the need for approval from a middleman.

Certainly, governments must first issue money before it can be used by people in routine transactions, but the government has no control over what I can do with a $100 bill once I have one. And while it's true that people occasionally use cash to pay for illicit activities, this isn't the currency's fault.

Altough this could be said about every criptocurrency, in order to change peoples lifes, first you got to have 1 dollar to invest.

**We can give those persons that dollar with a certain currency.**

**So, I made some reasearch on what 1 dollar can mean for People in Venezuela, Nigeria and India** (I choosed Nigeria and India randomly and Venezuela is a prime example of inflation).

I used eggs as an example. Most people love eggs and they are one of the most common sources of protein in all cultures. They are delicious and cheaper than fish/meat.


**Venezuela**

according to the website dolartoday.com, which tracks the unofficial exchange rate of the Venezuelan bolivar, as of September 2021, one US dollar could buy approximately 4,240 Venezuelan bolivars on the black market.

However, according to a report by Reuters in July 2021, a carton of 30 eggs was being sold for around 2.7 million bolivars, which is equivalent to approximately 0.64 US dollars at the black market exchange rate. This would mean that one US dollar could buy approximately 47 eggs in Venezuela.

**Nigeria**

As of September 2021, one US dollar could buy approximately 411 Nigerian naira on the official exchange rate. However, due to the prevalence of the black market, the actual exchange rate could be much higher. According to a report by Vanguard News, a crate of eggs (which contains 30 eggs) was being sold for around 1,350 Nigerian naira in July 2021, which would mean that one US dollar could buy approximately 9 eggs in Nigeria.

**India**

India is a vast and diverse country with varying costs of living depending on the region. As of September 2021, one US dollar could buy approximately 73 Indian rupees. According to a report by The Hindu Business Line, a dozen eggs were being sold for around 75 Indian rupees in July 2021, which would mean that one US dollar could buy around 9 eggs in India.

Think about it: Having a source of income unrelated to the government can be a game-changer in nations with volatile economy and currencies. They can acquire and hold value using Moons in a decentralized manner that is immune to wild inflation or shady political maneuvers.

I would love to hear community thoughts on this.

179,[SERIOUS] The satisfaction of playing the market both ways,118t96m,"I know that most of you advocate DCA, hodl, and similar strategies. Which aren't necessarily bad strategies and certainly easy ones as they require little effort and only requires you to wait for the market to run up in the long-term.

I also have a large part of my portfolio in spot positions to just stake and wait for the next bullrun ATHs. Nevertheless, I also try to feed on my action addiction on a more short-term by trading actively. Playing the market in the swings it has, keeps my craving for active trading and feeds the need  to feel like doing everything I can to maximize my returns.

For me this translates into leverage trading long and short based on the time frames such as 4 hours or daily. While TA isn't perfect, it certainly helps timing short and longs by looking at RSI for example. Another part of thisyis taking profits aggressively and cutting losses aggressively too. It helps sustain a healthy return, that requires some work but brings satisfaction in both ways.

As we are now calming a bit after some overbought time periods, it soothes my portfolio's value shorting a bit here too. All in all I try to be actuveyon both sides of the market based in longterm and short-term indicators accordingly. Slow and steady returns hopefully wins the race for me.

180,Blur VS OpenSea Saga,118stjz,"Hey there! So, last week something pretty wild went down in the NFT space. Blur basically blew it up with a bunch of hype and excitement by handing out free cash (Blur token airdrops) to its users.

It was all over Twitter and the markets, with a total trading volume of a whopping $430 million. And you know who was stoked? The degens, of course. Everyone loves free money!

But what's really interesting is this one specific issue that's not getting a lot of attention. Most people are only talking about the drama between OpenSea and Blur, but there's more to it than that.

So here's what happened: a few days back, Blur beat out OpenSea in daily ETH volume. And then, they went and said that creators couldn't earn royalties on both Blur and OpenSea, so they blocked trades on OpenSea.

Well, OpenSea fired back with an announcement that they were dropping their service fees to 0% and offering optional creator royalties to stay competitive.

And then all hell broke loose on Twitter. Most of the NFT community sided with Blur and thought OpenSea was grasping for relevance and falling short. Some even think this could be the beginning of the end for OpenSea.

But there are also people that want to see OpenSea develop their own token and airdrop like Blur did, while others think they should just do their own thing and stop chasing Blur.

It's pretty interesting because OpenSea has been the favorite marketplace up until now, with their slick and user-friendly design. Everyone from small NFT project creators to big-time traders and even the web3 curious uses it.

But the real power in the NFT economy is based on traders and whales, not the marketplaces or the creators. And up until now, there haven't been too many options for them.

So I think Blur made the smart moves, otherwhise we would not be here talking about it. It not meant to be ""one of them has to be taken down"" more like, OpenSea should do its own thing or try to compete so hard with Blur? What do you guys think?",kronosbit,35,5,0.68
181,Moon on-chain activity is the highest it's been since 2021!,118r7p6,"I made a similar post shortly after Moons [moved to Mainnet](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/wk75p2/pack_your_moons_were_moving_to_mainnet/), but given the recent buzz around Moonplace, banner rentals, and general sentiment I thought I'd provide a 6-month update on Moon on-chain activity.

For all the charts below, I **exclude transactions from Moon distributions** **and transactions of <0.01 Moons**, since they heavily skew the data and aren't aren't very interesting.

# Moon Transactions are at the highest level since December 2021

Over the last 28-days, there have been \~1,475 Moon transactions per day. The last time there was this much activity was on December 4th, 2021.

[Moon Transactions](https://preview.redd.it/p0nl2x1teoja1.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89cc548c1650adf2eda44e7d694d7e339d485ced)

# ""Active"" Moon addresses are near an ATH

Here, I define a unique active moon address as one that has *sends* at least 0.01 moons on a given day. The daily average over the last month is \~205 unique addresses per day, and the last time it was this high was on September 18, 2021.

Can you guess what the spikes in this chart are? See below this graph for the answer

[\\""Active\\"" Moon Addresses](https://preview.redd.it/4tw3ugdpgoja1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=29485a3837efe6ec1ded2a63d5dd61164f333535)

**The spikes in the chart above were due to users dumping Moons like clockwork on every single distribution date. Due to CCIP-030 (implemented in April 2022), this behavior has slowed considerably.**

The most recent spike is due to Moonplace.io!

# Transactions between Redditors (tipping) is more common than in the months before Mainnet!

This might come as a surprise to some, but tipping has seen a bit of a rebirth recently and is the highest it's been since 2021. Despite the need for nova gas for transactions, it hasn't deterred some generous Redditors.

Edit: upon further review, many of these tips are quite small in value (between 0.01 and 0.1), which is why they aren't showing up in the trends dashboard at [ccmoons.com/tipping](https://ccmoons.com/tipping) (since for that I require txs to be >= 1 moon)

182,Zanpaktous and Cryptocurrency,118q7h7,"Fellow degens, have you ever wondered which asset is more valuable: Cryptocurrencies or Zanpakutous? Well, we did some research and found some interesting findings.

First off, let's talk about the market value of these assets. As of February 2023, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is around $4.5 trillion, with Bitcoin alone accounting for over 40% of that. Meanwhile, the combined value of all Zanpakutous worldwide is estimated to be around $500 billion. So, it's clear that crypto has a much larger market share and is worth significantly more than Zanpakutous.

But, that's not the whole story. When it comes to volatility, the two assets are similar. Over the past year, the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated between $30,000 and $65,000, with an average daily volatility of around 2%. Meanwhile, the abilities and personalities of Zanpakutous are also subject to change, and their value can increase or decrease depending on the demand for certain powers or abilities. So, while the two assets may seem very different, they are pretty similar regarding their potential for volatility.

Finally, let's talk about the communities surrounding these assets. Crypto has a massive online community, with subreddits like r/WallStreetBets and r/CryptoCurrency boasting millions of members. Meanwhile, the Zanpakutou community is much smaller but still passionate, with forums and message boards dedicated to discussing the lore and abilities of these powerful weapons. These communities provide a space for sharing knowledge and ideas and can be a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their skills.

In conclusion, while the market value of cryptocurrencies is significantly higher than that of Zanpakutous, the two assets are similar in terms of their potential for volatility and the passion of their communities. So, whether you're trading crypto or wielding a Zanpakutou, there's plenty of room for excitement and potential gains.

183,Buy the dip or buy the rise?,118otnr,"When you have some money to invest and you don't want to invest them all at once is it better to increase your investment every time the price goes up or when it goes down?

Let's say for example that you have 10 dollars today and you want to invest them 1 dollar at a time. You use the first one today. You don't know if the prices are going to go up or down (you can never know). Will you invest the second dollar if the market goes 10% up or 10% down?

My opinion is that it is better to buy the rise instead of buying the dip. It is a safer and better strategy overall. I have very little knowledge of the cryptocurrency market but I have been burned enough in the stock market to learn that is not a good idea to increase your position in an investment that is not going well even uf that lowers the average price.

When you first invest in something you do it because you expected it to go up right? So if it goes down instead, why would you want to throw more money at it. It is better to wait till the market turns or even to sell your initial investment with losses if you see that the market is keeping to go in the opposite direction. On the contrary when your investment is going according to plan you could invest more money in it and increase your profits. You will also have to opportunity to sell with profits due to your initial investment even if the market turns.

If you've read up to this point that's the main point I want to discuss on. I'm adding some general advice from the internet but you dont need to read them all.

Don’t let losses slide…!

While small gains are taken far too quickly, bad investments that are in the red are often held on to for far too long, which can result in enormous losses of assets. To a large extent, this is also psychological.

After all, the liquidation of a losing position means defeat, which is only actually realised when the losses have been realised, and the chance of recovery has thus been lost. “Until surrender, the battle is not yet lost”, as not only commanders but also investors too often try to convince themselves. The losses, therefore, continue to grow.

It should be borne in mind that a position that is down 10% must rise again by a good 11% to reach the starting level. If a share has fallen by 20%, it has to increase by as much as 25% to avoid losses, and if it has fallen by 50%, it even has to double. Some investors even get their hopes up at a 90% loss that the tide will finally turn for the better.

In order to avoid this state of affairs, investment decisions in securities that slide (more clearly) into the loss zone should be checked particularly thoroughly, and, in case of doubt, the emergency brake should be pulled in good time. In most cases, price losses that exceed the overall market have a lasting reason, even if this is not yet clear to the investor concerned. In any case, an end with horror is better than a horror without an end.

Strategically resist short-term profit-taking!

In a world that is changing ever faster, security and reassurance are important basic human needs. This is also reflected in the stock market behaviour of many private investors. Particularly in uncertain times and in rather weak stock market phases, many investors therefore tend to hold on to or secure gains once they have been made.

The easiest way to do this is to sell stock and bond positions that are – even if only slightly – in the black. Often, therefore, even small profits are realised far too early. Similar to winning the lottery or casino, the associated dopamine release in the brain can promote feelings of happiness. At the same time, the investor receives confirmation that he has done everything right, and thirdly, a sense of security sets in since the invested money is now “protected” again in the current account. Of course, this overlooks the fact that the funds have to be reinvested in order to generate income, and the supposed security is, therefore, only very temporary.

Investors should be aware of these correlations and hold good-performing positions until the originally set price target or fair value is reached. Of course, this only applies as long as the assessment of the respective stock has not changed to the negative.

At the same time, you should always be aware, also in connection with possible advisory clients, that frequent reallocations are by no means to be equated with the consistent action of an active investor or asset manager, even if they suggest this. The resulting transaction costs (“back and forth makes pockets empty”) should not even be mentioned here […]

There's no doubt that the Internet Computer has been gaining a lot of traction lately, with more and more people showing interest in its decentralized approach to cloud computing. It offers a way for disparate data centers around the world to collaborate and provide a decentralized alternative to the centralized internet cloud providers we have today.

187,Cosmos replicated security (formerly Interchain security v1) proposal is now live on Cosmos ecosystem for voting.,118l9ur,"#  V9 Lambda Upgrade

>The Cosmos Hub is upgrading its security system with a new feature called Replicated Security. This will allow the Cosmos Hub to provide its strong security to other blockchains, which are called 'consumer chains'. The cost to censor or control a consumer chain with an economic attack is the same as the cost to censor or control the Cosmos Hub itself. This means that consumer chains can benefit from the Cosmos Hub's security without having to maintain their own validator sets.  
>  
>  
Replicated Security works through the IBC protocol. Consumer chains receive periodic IBC packets containing the up-to-date validator set of the Cosmos Hub and use this to update their own validator sets, effectively replicating the Hub's validator set. This means that the Cosmos Hub's validators can validate multiple chains at once with the same stake.  
>  
>  
In exchange for this service, consumer chains are expected to send a portion of their fees and inflation to the Cosmos Hub validators and delegators. These tokens will then be included as part of the Cosmos Hub's staking rewards.

&#x200B;

This upgrade will add the necessary code to allow for replicated security on the cosmos hub, allowing smaller consumer chains to share in the security of the already established Cosmos hub.

ATOM delegators will receive staking rewards from each of these consumer chains using replicated security in the form of either their native token if they have one or transaction fees generated by the consumer chain.

**example:**

*Chains A,B,C,D submit proposals to use replicated security and are accepted by delegators voting yes.*

*Chains A, B & C have native tokens, chain D does not.*

*So by staking ATOM you will now receive the regular ATOM staking rewards currently at 21.5% APR in ATOM + Chain's A native token + chain's B native token + chain's C native token + 25% of chain's D transaction fees converted into ATOM.*

*So ATOM delegators will be receiving tokens from any consumer chain leasing security from the Cosmos HUB through replicated security.*

&#x200B;

The proposal also states that this is one of the first steps in building the ATOM economic Zone

# The ATOM economic zone

>It is anticipated that consumer chains using Replicated Security will collaborate closely in an 'ATOM economic zone'. This is expected to have a snowball effect, with the Cosmos Hub securing a growing group of high-value decentralized protocols. Already, some prominent projects such as a smart-contracting platform, an AMM, several liquid staking providers and others have expressed interest in using Replicated Security from the Cosmos Hub.  
Replicated Security can also be used to further the cause of “Hub minimalism”. Any new features to the Hub, even if they are core to the Hub's functionality, can be launched as consumer chains. This allows the Hub to scale better and separate release cycles, enabling faster deployment of new features.

With a lot of discussion about the latest [r/cc](https://www.reddit.com/r/cc/) poll that will reward liquidity providers using SushiSwap to support the sub (companies paying for banners, etc), I took a look at recent news and there are several red flags.

190,I've lost one Moon! How could that happen?,118j3rn,"Hey everyone,

Just as the title says. This morning I had 584 moons (not a lot, I know, but still, that's how many I had.) And now, I have 583 moons. I've gained moons before, but never lost moons before.

I have a few questions, and no answers - here they are, in no particular order:

1. Is this a new thing? If so, is there an explanation post somewhere that someone can post a link to please.
2. How could it have happened? I haven't tipped anyone (sorry!) so I know that I haven't 'lost' a moon that way (not that that would count as a loss anyway).
3. Has there been a correction, a re-calculation perhaps? I know that it's Moon Week.
4. Has this happened to anyone else? If so, what was your loss - also 1 moon, or more?
5. Will it happen again? (This is perhaps the most important question that I have right now!)
6. Is there any way to prevent it from happening again?

Looking forward to all of your speculation, theories, and, hopefully, genuine answers. This isn't a joke thread, this is genuine.

Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks to [/u/Classroom\_Strict/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Classroom_Strict/) for getting me to check my vault. Apparently, sometimes mobile and desktop don't display the same. I'd been looking at my mobile previously, and seeing 584, but when I posted this, I was on desktop. I don't know WHY it does that, but I have been assured that once Moons are in your Vault, they can't come out, unless you authorise it. Thank you everyone, I feel much better now!",chandler-blackshadow,131,3,0.52
191,[SERIOUS] Link Your Reddit Vault to MetaMask,118i95j,"Today Reddit went down for a brief period of time. For those of you who experienced the outage and tried to access your account it may have looked as though you were banned. No post history was showing up, I couldn't see my user profile, and worst of all I didn't have access to my Vault. I was however able to verify that my Moons were safe and sound in my Vault because I linked it to my MetaMask. Now, if you were to get banned or suspended for whatever reason, you wouldn't be able to access your Vault. See Reddit's terms of service agreement [here](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/previews-terms#:~:text=If%20your%20Account%20is%20suspended,Virtual%20Goods%20in%20it):

&nbsp;


>If your Account is suspended, then you will be unable to access your Vault (including any Verified Virtual Goods in it) until the suspension ends. If your Account is banned, then you may, at Reddit’s discretion, be unable to access your Vault (including any Verified Virtual Goods in it) indefinitely.

&nbsp;


Today's outage basically mimicked what it would look like if you were banned. You wouldn't be able to access your own Moons without Reddit's discretion. This is the anti-thesis to self-custody.

&nbsp;

Here is a quick guide to link your Vault to MetaMask (credit to u/Wargizmo):

&nbsp;


* Go to the reddit app and go to your reddit vault. You'll need 

> 1) your public address

and
> 2) and your seed phrase

&nbsp;


* Open metamask and create a new account using your seed phrase. (You'll need a fresh install of metamask because for some reason it only lets you import using a private key instead of a seed phrase if you already have an account active; make sure you remember your old account details so you can get it back - there are also tools to convert seed phrase to private key but be careful with these and make sure you aren't connected to the internet if you use them)

&nbsp;


* NOTE: if you install it on a separate device or browser you can then export the private key from the new metamask and then use the exported key to import into your regular old metamask as a new imported account.

&nbsp;


* Now you need to add the Arbitrum Nova network to metamask. In settings -> network input the following: Newtowk name: Arbitrum Nova, RPC Url: [https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc](https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc) , Chain ID: 42170

&nbsp;


* Now switch to the Arbitrum Nova network in the top right corner

&nbsp;


* You now need to add moons token. You can get the token address by going to [https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io](https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io) and copying your public address from your reddit vault and pasting it into the explorer. Under tokens you should see your moons (and bricks or other reddit tokens you might have). Click on moons and where it says ""contract"" copy this string of characters. If you don't see it, it means your moons haven't been transferred to the new network yet, give it time.

&nbsp;


* From your metamask wallet (which should now be set to the Arbitrum Nova network) you'll be able to click ""import tokens"". Under token address, paste the contract address you copied from the previous step, for token symbol MOON should come up automatically, set token decimal to 18 and click import.

&nbsp;


* Congratulations, you now have self-custody of your Moons without needing Reddit to access them.

192,Which crypto news sites are trustworthy?,118izl4,"When trying to get one's head around what's what, it's important to be able to tell good from bad. Trustworthy from deceitful. True from false.  
  
I keep seeing posts here in r/cryptocurrency linking to all kinds of different websites, some resembling amateur blogs (not that I have a problem with amateur blogs).  
  
A lot of these websites look really low quality, and most of the time, the articles consist of just one or two paragraphs and then some pointless graphic like a coin sailing on an ocean of graphs.  
  
There must be a reason why the good people of this subreddit are creating posts linking to these dubious sites with their low-quality articles. I just don't see why. Nobody is going to upvote such posts, and there's obviously nobody interested in low-quality news.  
  
So I'll ask broadly: Which news sites do you trust and why?

193,"I'm sitting on too much AVAX- 8.6% of my portfolio, and it's time to diversify. Thoughts?",118ia6y,"Hey guys. I feel like I'm sitting on too much AVAX. I like having it in my portfolio, but I feel like at 8.6%, it's too much. The rundown:

**41% ETH**

**27% BTC**

**8.6% AVAX**

**6.6% SOL**

**4.8% OP**

**3.5% MATIC**

This gives you the rough idea. Looking at the stats it appears that I would have been better off if I bought ETH instead of AVAX. I'm 17% down on my AVAX position when compared with ETH. ETH is outpacing it. It's time to diversify. OP position seems sufficient, SOL too. I'm comfortable with my ETH position, although I keep buying more on dips. My MATIC position grew nice and fat. It outpaced ETH by 362% (!!) :) Needless to say, I was buying MATIC low. Very low. I wish I bought more, but don't we all... If I'm gonna jump out of AVAX (I'm in profit), I don't wanna gamble it away. BTC and ETH are safe to jump into, but I got enough of those two. Any suggestions? Go more into MATIC? Some other strong project?

194,How much of your investments do you set aside for crypto?,118i258,"As per the title says, how much of your portfolio have you set aside for crypto? Crypto is a risky investment vehicle when you compare to other investments such as bonds, real estate, etc. As such, people may likely be less keen on investing in crypto due its high risk factor. However, even in crypto, there are difference risk levels, such as bitcoin which is called the gold of cryptocurrency and therefore lower risk as compared to something like safemoon, which is very high risk. As such, is it wise to invest fully in crypto or is it better to diversify and only put a small percentage of your money into crypto? Of course, the income factor does play a role in this as well.

195,"Its understandable why Polygon is doing some layoffs, but maybe it is worrisome",118h99d,"Going to add a disclaimer here that Polygon is my second biggest bag and by far my best performer.

Im massively bullish on Polygon as a long-term project. Yes im aware it has a centralization and multisig issue, but it has a big presence in social media, NFT markets, defi, gaming, and scaling solutions. A company that can flex this kind of versatility this early on is impressive.

Today a founder, Sandeep, announced theyre culling their staff by about 20% (100 employees), but another thing he mentioned was that they currently hold **$250M and 1.9B MATIC**. Last year though they raised **$450M** in a funding round, and their token has also done almost a 4x since it hit its bottom so how did they burn through all this money? Its one thing if they were maybe overleveraged during the bull market, but their rise has largely started from the market bottom.

In what has been a horrible bear market for some cryptos Polygon has seen an unprecedented amount of success, but maybe this is coming at a large cost with ~2 years of runway left before selling off their tokens in treasury. $250M in liquid cash isnt really all that much in the wild west of crypto, Harmony One comes to mind about how one hack or exploit can really decide if you sink or swim.

Are any of you Polygon holders concerned? Its nice to see theyre taking steps to be more prudent, but do you think Polygon spent too much trying to get ahead during the bear market? Were you alarmed at all at these numbers or do you see it as the cost of doing business?",marsangelo,56,21,0.74

The first thing I noticed was that I had a 50/50 chance of successfully getting into my mobile Coinbase wallet. Half of the time when I opened the wallet on my phone I would get a ""Something with wrong"" error. I assumed this was a bug and it will get fixed so I let it slide and decided to just put up with it. 

The next thing I noticed is that bitcoin is only supported on the Coinbase mobile app. I can't send the first, largest and best cryptocurrency on Coinbase's chrome extension wallet. Another setback I'm annoyed about but decided to brush off since I use my phone for 90% of my crypto related stuff anyway.

The last thing is that I sent a BTC test transaction from Coinbase to my Coinbase mobile wallet about 30 minutes ago. It is still pending and has 0 confirmations. This pushed me over the edge. I don't understand how Coinbase, a crypto giant that has been around for years and has pioneered a lot of crypto features when it comes to exchanges has such a terrible wallet. Now I have to contact their shitty support and see if there is anything they can do about my pending transaction. Thank god it was a test transaction.

198,Bitcoin is finally decoupling from the stock market as Bitcoin pumped while the stock market lost value,118ehoo,"Bitcoin has a positive correlation with the stock market for years now, which means that Bitcoin typically moves up when the stock market does and dumps when the stock market does. This is not news.

Yet that does not stop us from dreaming about a decoupling, when the relationship with stocks turns negative and Bitcoin does its own thing.

&#x200B;

**A bad decoupling in 2022 - The fall of FTX**

Last year the relationship between Bitcoin and the stock market (S&P 500) did turn negative once. Unfortunately for us, this was a 'bad decoupling'. More specifically, in November/December of 2022, Stocks rallied off the lows as the Dollar (DXY) lost strength, while Bitcoin moved in the opposite direction because of the FTX crash.

&#x200B;

**The first decoupling in 2023 is a 'good decoupling'!**

Now, in 2023, we have our first moment of 'good decoupling' with the S&P 500 as the correlation turns negative again. While the stock market is correcting with three red weeks in a row, Bitcoin pumped hard to $25K. This has not happened for a long time.

&#x200B;

**A visualization of both events**

Both events are visualized in the chart below. This chart shows the price of Bitcoin with an orange line and the correlation in blue below, which ranges between 1 (perfect positive correlation, both move up or down together) to -1 (perfect negative correlation, one moves up and the other stays stagnant or moves down).

I highlighted the FTX moment and the current moment in red.

200,Potential Risks of CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) to Financial Freedom and Privacy,118ed1a,"CBDCs are starting to be a real thing an a threat for our financial freedom and privacy. This is why I am going to present my point of view about the negative consequences that allowing CBDCs will happen in the future and why we have to fight so that it does not happen.

# The all-seeing eye

CBDCs are a huge threat for financial privacy. They are backed by central banks allowing governments to track and monitor all transactions in real time which could lead to a world where financial privacy is a thing of the past. Meaning that people wont have control over who has access to their financial information.

# Dictatorship

Furthermore, it could lead to increased censorship and control of financial transactions where governments could use CBDCs to freeze or seize assets at will, and to block transactions that they are used to be against their interests. This would be an infringement of individual freedoms and could lead to a heavily regulated and controlled world by centralized authorities.

# Manipulation

Besides, CBDCs could potentially lead to a more unstable financial system. Replacing physical cash with digital currencies it would make it easier for central banks to manipulate the supply and interest rates leading to economic instability and inflation.

**My personal opinion**

I think we must do something to show people the dangers of allowing governments to establish CBDCs and maybe create a movement to fight this dictatorial currencies.

Luckily Mike got the help he needed and is now thriving exploring other sub reddits, he deleted facebook, hit the gym and lawyered up. His wife is now paying him alimony and he's putting all that money back into moons, Mikes a smart man - Be like Mike.

For others the MOON addiction is far worse, some have gone so far past just farming that they are now performing any type of job for moons. I would not recommend anybody visit this sub as the depravity in it isn't for the faint of heart.

Before you fall this far with your MOON addiction I urge you to seek help.

If you feel you are to far gone perhaps it's best to simply purchase your moons on a DEX like sushi swap and take a break from farming.",Odlavso,422,83,0.6

203,US Crypto Tax reporting,118d8bl,"tl/dr: I need a good comprehensive crypto tax reporting tool / service for US reporting

Back in the beginning of January 2022, I was stupidly influenced to trade some of the BTC I had previously bought for some defi shit coins projects and some cefi sites to ""generate alpha and use that to buy more BTC!""  Hard lesson learned, and I will never do that again. 

So, like a good diworsifier, I spread it around to a bunch of things that eventually went to zero for one reason or another.  No, it was not ""more than I could afford to lose"" but nobody likes to lose.  

One of those things was Celsius, and I realize that since bankrupcy is not finished, I will have to claim my interest income, and won't be able to claim the loss. But there are other things like Terra and a bunch of other ""Defi as a passive income nodes as a service projects"" etc. that just went poof.  

Anyway, I didn't do a great job of keeping track of all these transactions, but I do have my wallets still. So, I was thinking I read somewhere that there are tools I could hook into my wallet addresses and it would make sense of all those transactions for reporting purposes.  I also read somewhere that someone had written, ""and you don't have to give your wallet address to this one"" and I think the implication was, giving wallet address to a crypt accounting tool is bad. 

So, I'm not sure what to do to get my CPA an accurate idea of what I did last year and could use a little advice. 

Maybe I have to go hire a specific accounting service that gathers all this data and makes sense of it and passes it to my CPA?",retirementdreams,18,5,0.78

Sup guys, thanks for all the support on the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/114vib4/platform_for_shorting_tokens/)! I appreciate all the suggestions and the feedback!  
To me, it seems there are definitely ways to short cryptocurrencies out there, but the only ones you can really short are big blue chips like ETH, BTC, etc. This takes all the fun out of it IMO.

After posting last week on friday I spent most of the weekend coming up with a name then the rest of it spinning up a prototype here: [www.tumbyl.com](http://www.tumbyl.com/)! Not much there yet but hoping to get y’alls feedback on which tokens we should be able to short and which ones we should be able to long!  
Currently building out the backend but really hoping we can make this a community project and have you guys vote in some funny tokens that everyone wants to see supported! I also want to hear your guys’ feedback on some of the architecture - more on that below:  
Unlike GMX and dy/dx which are geared towards institutions - I want this to be made for average people to bet for or against their favorite tokens - to that end, Im not sure what the best features are to include. Comment your thoughts on:

1. Mobile app vs web app - I think i can do both but curious what priority should be
2. Leverage vs non leverage trading - I think for shorting leverage makes for more opportunities and better trades, but could just build this without a leverage option as well
3. Tokens to include on launch!

Aiming to have this up and running with the top voted tokens in a couple weeks so stay tuned!

208,Crypto is not about luck but about skill. If you depend on luck you will lose all money soon anyway.,118b84x,"Yes, some people in  crypto gamble and make big money on some shitcoin, but that doesn't mean much. They  were gamblers  at first place, they won't stop, they will try to repeat it and they will fail miserably. Even if they will use few braincells to take some profits out most of them will waste those money  on parties, brand clothes, expensive sport cars and iced gold watches. Bad money menagement is something  vast majority of people that get a lot of money fast ( lottery winners, nba players,  rappers or crypto investors) have in common. In few days they go from being average to having hundreds  of thousands or millions dollars.


I like to explain it this way :"" If you won lottery once it doesn't mean you have more skill to win it second time"". It don't increase your chances at all. If you worked hard to learn and got new skills, you will be able to both value money more  and reinvest them in more profitable way.
Paradox of luck in crypto is  that it most often happen to people that have no idea how to invest and menage their money safely. Smart people don't buy random shitcoins the same way they don't  buy lottery tickets. They know it is waste of money.  And depending on something that may never happen is silly. Many people played lottery for 50 years and never win, if they would spend that time and money on learning about investing they maybe wouldn't be Warren Buffet, but definitely would  would be able to retire in the meanwhile few times.

I see it in this subreddit community too, I know people that invest in everything thinking they will  get lucky  and make money. They fail time after time. I also know people that every or almost every time succeed and make crazy money, they simply do research, invest in solid projects and have better risk menagement. Skilled person will make maybe less money in short term but much  money in long term. Luck can't compare with skill.",Nuewim,80,0,0.46
209,Short term holders are at one of the least losses in history right now and are taking profits at the fastest pace since April 2022.,118b2yi,"While we keep moving up it is also important to look at how the two group of holders are doing. The long-term holders will just have a further increase in profits of their supply but that will have no big consequences as they are not going to sell anyway right now. Much more important are the short-term holders as usually, them being in profit means that the rally can go on.

Here we can see that the short-term holders are at nearly no losses at all, only 7k BTC by short-term holders are still in losses right now which is literally nothing. Also only a few times short-term holders are in such a good state and all of those times we were in a bull market or at the beginning of one.

And obviously short-term holders are not just sitting on those profits but are actually realising them and that at the fastest pace since April 2022, where the BTC price was at over $40k. Short-term holders taking profits is not immediately a bad thing as they can keep taking profits over months but the pace usually declines which is not the case right now, meaning that much of our rally is still left.

210,The hypocrite's hypocrite,118agg8,"I'm going to do my best to come at this in a neutral manner because (a) I hope not to offend any group in particular and (b) that's how sensible conversations should ideally be. 

At this point there are hundreds of posts about ""insert CEO/devs name here"" and how they hate criticism and love to insult others. ( And no I'm not just talking about Charles Hoskinson of Cardano lol. He makes up for a big chunk of it, but definitely not the majority.) Every single rich person with a stake in this game has said something to defend themselves whether it be over the top, or even quite reasonable to downright dumb as shit. 

Some people may need to take a step back and read what they have to say about these people. I can't be specific because it's more than just a handful of people. Shit, even I'm guilty of it in the past. But the longer I've been here the plainer it's become that it's the bigger powers playing is against each other. They don't really have to try hard; just pay for an article that completely takes something out of context and let the wolves go wild. There have been articles that completely plagiarized a Redditors well thought out post because it was easier than actual journalism. We are essentially feeding a monster of our own creation. 

Call me naive, but shouldn't we work together and *not* fight amongst ourselves? That's not to say we shouldn't be critical. But therein lies the difference. People should be able to take constructive criticism. People should also know how to properly give it. You can't expect people (especially the most loud personalities like CH) to stay quiet when people aren't even engaging properly. Although I tend to disagree with the ""CH attacks other projects"" narrative. He's prettt good at being constructive about his criticism. He does like 40 minute whiteboards to help lay them out.  It's A little too much sometimes and he can admittedly have short patience some days but those videos have helped me understand a lot. 

Would I like CH to be more quiet? Sure. But I'd also like the community to acknowledge that a lot of this sub acts the same way and just doesn't hold themselves to the same standards that they expect all these public faces/voices to have. 

Peace and Love. Hopefully this comes across positively!

211,I don’t understand the hate for ADA and Charles.,118a10w,"*****Obvious disclaimer, among others, I have a big bag of ADA.*****

Most people’s dislike of ADA seems to come from Charles. I’m going to put aside another big point people bring up, the fact that Haskell is inherently harder to code in than other languages and only focus on the Charles aspect - maybe Haskell can be another post. 

I cannot deny that Charles is a very outspoken man and has MANY times contradicts himself on things such as ignoring the haters or not feeding the trolls. I’ll waive the white flag on the point all day. 

The problem is that most people seem to gloss over the fact that Charles cares immensely about crypto as a technology and wants nothing but the best for it. In fact, a lot of the things he says - and then gets absolutely ripped to shreds for in this sub - are valid, real problems of other technologies. FUD is not the same as criticism and people immediately label anything that puts a “bad light” on their coin as FUD. If people can’t understand that constructive criticism, or even blatantly stating problems with other cryptos is for the greater good of the entire community, then that’s just going to delay adoption even further and prevent all of us from getting a Lambo sooner. 

I’d also like to remind everyone of how Charles went and spoke in front of the government on behalf of the entire cryptocurrency community/technology and he was highly regarded across not only internet, but also this sub for his speech. Everyone couldn’t have been happier with what he said and that he did  it for the betterment of the entire crypto space. I’m sorry people, but you can’t have it both ways. 

He cares about the tech, has a vision, and is striving for success. Does he run his mouth too much sometimes? Yes. But to me, this doesn’t warrant the hate he and ADA get.

First I want to explain some differences in exchanges and some of their categories. Some include CEX's (There are Non-KYC and KYC), decentralized derivatives (Futures, perpetuals, etc), swaps, atomic swaps (cross chains), and P2P exchanges (Buying and selling right to and from others) are the main ones.

And remember to keep in mind that a lot of exchanges, especially ""decentralized"" derivatives, lie about being decentralized and are actually just CEX's without KYC.

[dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/) \- Decentralized derivative, I use this the most and it's always been a great and reliable place to trade efficiently.

[Block DX](https://blockdx.net/) \- Atomic swap, I only recently learned about this, but it looks amazing on paper and I'm really interested in trying it out.

[Bisq](https://bisq.network/) \- P2P exchange, The well-known classic, very private and a great place to buy and sell. Can be a little complicated for some and doesn't support many coins.

Swaps - I grouped these together because they are mostly the same, swaps include [Sushi Swap](https://www.sushi.com/), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap), [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/swap), [RCPSwap](https://rcpswap.com/), etc. These have many pairs usually and are usually really easy, anonymous, and fast to use.

[Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com) \- Decentralized derivative, haven't gotten to use it yet but looks great so far and seems to be very good.

[Pancake Swap Perpetuals](https://perp.pancakeswap.finance/) \- Decentralized derivative, I never used it very much but it seems to work fine and is decent overall, has a lot of pairs out of all the decentralized derivative exchanges.

215,Why banks are blocking your crypto purchase,118964u,"Over the last week or so I’ve seen a few comments about banks blocking cryptocurrency purchases. I understand the animosity many of you hold towards banks due to their handling of cryptocurrency purchases but I thought it might be interesting to some of you to get an insight into the perspective of those who work there, at least at the mid to lower level.

Until recently I worked in a financial crime team for a nationwide bank and it was one of the more crypto-neutral banks. The role comprised of supporting victims of fraud, securing their accounts, investigating fraud cases and of course tracing and recovering stolen funds where possible. I had been involved in crypto for several years when I joined the team but chose to keep this to myself as it seemed that the general consensus in my team and the fraud department as a whole was that crypto was a giant ponzi scheme full of scammers, which to be fair, isn’t entirely untrue.

&#x200B;

The two below cases have stayed with me for different reasons. Imagine working at a bank and dealing with the below customers:

&#x200B;

* A young man called up as he had joined a telegram group to seek “crypto investment advice”. He had paid $1000 in crypto for “exclusive technical analysis”. Reading between the lines it seemed that he had joined a paid signals group but was trying to conceal it. He told me he had fell afoul of the mods and was banned. He asked if we could get his money back. I had to explain that his crypto transaction was irreversible, which he knew. He then asked if we could submit a chargeback against the crypto exchange that he had bought the crypto from before withdrawing. We could, but we’re not going to as the crypto exchange is not at fault. They left an unhappy customer and eventually ended up closing their account.
* There was a case of a middle-aged man who had deposited in excess of $100k in BTC over the span of two weeks to a niche crypto exchange which specialized in a dogecoin knock-off. He had been approached online by an ‘investment analyst’ who shared the unique opportunity of getting in early on the next memecoin. He started with small amounts to play it safe. However, every time he logged onto the exchange he was up another several thousand dollars. So, he kept on depositing more and more. After two weeks he decided to sell a portion of his profits. Of course, he couldn’t withdraw. First, he needed to provide ID. Then proof of address. Then he needed to provide source of funds. His evidence of source of funds were deemed insufficient by the exchanges AML team and he was subsequently locked out of his account. A day after he called us the site became defunct. The website was registered offshore. We couldn’t help him other than provide a sympathetic ear. Fortunately, he told me he owned his own business and that’s why he had the excess money to invest. So to him, the loss wasn’t life-ending but he was certainly distraught by the experience. He was more understanding of our inability to recover the funds but was still upset we didn't call him and question him about large bank transfers to the legit crypto exchange as we may have made him realize he was getting scammed and he may have not sent as much money.

You may have noticed that the above cases were victims who were somewhat experienced in crypto, in that they at least knew how to withdraw crypto from an exchange. However, by far the most prevalent crypto scam (well in excess of 95% of crypto-related cases) were the bitcoin pop-up adverts. It was overwhelmingly the older generation who fell for this scam. In one case, an elderly victim referred to Bitcoin as “bitcorn” throughout the entire twenty-minute phone call. If you’ve ever disabled your adblocker, you’re probably aware of these pop-up ads like the one below:

[How everyone can become a millionaire..](https://preview.redd.it/ww9jhtzwfkja1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=39830c4227dd60b108b4be4e7c496f25d57f654f)

They’d click the advert, enter their personal details and in an hour or so later they would receive a phone call from a ‘broker’. The broker would sell them the investment and explain that it doesn’t matter how inexperienced they are as they would manage it all for them. They would just need them to send over their identity documentation to get started: passport, driving licence, bank statements and so on. Sometimes, they’d even ask for a photo of the victim holding their passport with a sheet of paper with the date written on. The scammer would then open an account on a crypto exchange under their identity and then walk the victim through on how to send a bank transfer over to the exchange with the account reference. It was typically a matter of weeks of the ‘broker’ continuously pressuring the victim to deposit more and more money until they realized they were being scammed. The vast majority of the time we were not able to recover the funds from the crypto exchanges as the scammer had already withdrawn the crypto and understandably, the exchanges refused to accept any liability.

I probably dealt with around 5-6 cases where the elderly victim broke down in tears when I informed them that we could not recover the funds, which were typically their life savings. Some of the calls were honestly heart-breaking. Reports were written up and sent to the authorities but nothing would ever come of it to the point that it became more of a formality than anything else.

Pretty much all the fraud cases related to crypto ended in a *Sorry For Your Loss* from us to the victim.

Crypto may very well be seen as a threat with the upper echelons of the banking industry but the fact of the matter was is that it is just a giant headache for fraud departments more than anything else. The amount of crypto-related fraud cases continually increases. It effected SLAs for fraud investigations which also led to the success rate of recovery with other types of fraud to decrease too as time is always of the essence. Victims would become upset with us when we couldn’t recover funds which in turn effected the bank’s image. Warnings were put up before bank transfers could be submitted, emails were sent out to customers warning them of fraud, including crypto-related fraud but it wasn’t enough to make a noticeable difference.

Eventually higher-ups in the bank I worked at made a choice. Many types of fraud are hard for banks to block but with crypto they had the ability to block transfers to the business bank accounts of crypto exchanges, which is eventually what we ended up doing for most exchanges, at least for bank transfers. With card payments, fraud cases would go through VISA and Mastercard and it was ultimately on them if they were to refund or not.

It’s all well and good put to expect more common sense from the younger victims but most of the victims were the elderly who were often technically illiterate, vulnerable and far too trusting. I raised the idea of blocking business accounts of crypto exchanges based on the users vulnerability status and introducing an age threshold (as to not affect the average crypto buyer) but this was bounced back as being too much work and also opening us up to accusations of discrimination. I left shortly after. In time I do think it will improve, but we're not there yet.

*Needless to say, whenever you have a minute with your elderly relatives, please educate them about the risk of fraud. If they're unsure of someone or something asking for money or some who is sharing an investment opportunity, get them to agree to* ***always*** *speak to a relative first before sending any money.*

216,A guide on how to lose everything and stay in debt. The cure for cryptocurrency,1188zz6,"To begin with, in a period when cryptocurrency prices were rising, it was extremely difficult not to make a profit. Any initial coin offering (ICO) or purchase of cryptocurrency was profitable and even individuals with limited knowledge could make money. However, the value of investments could just as rapidly plummet, leading to sudden losses of wealth. Instances such as the UST and Ftx collapse caused several of my acquaintances and friends to lose their deposits, forcing some to seek employment in alternative industries for financial stability. Despite this, I managed to maintain my financial position.

The bear market lasted more than a year, the money was leaving quickly, and there were fewer and fewer opportunities to earn, all my earnings turned into a casino game, where you buy something with the hope of growth, but the bear market does not forgive mistakes and many deals brought me only losses.

On the current rebound of bitcoin I started to play with futures, at the very beginning the long BTC brought me pleasant emotions, easy money and the feeling that I understand this market, but how I cheated myself. Later, I started to try to guess the reversal, and every time I was out of luck, and I was constantly putting more and more of my money to try to win back, thinking that I couldn't be unlucky. Sometimes I guessed and the feeling that I understood something, that I saw some regularities came back to me. At some point I just decided to wait for the next fall and not to move, not to put a stop and just wait, and there it was, another rise from 21,000 to 25,000 dollars, out of fear I closed my position in the negative and went back into the short, putting more and more leverage. And now I have lost all my money, but I have made even more stupid mistake, taking a loan, hoping to recover at least some part of the money, and now there is almost nothing left in the account. It is hard for me to describe my condition at that moment, it is just a feeling of hopelessness and emptiness, as if life ended at that moment, as if there is a huge wall in front of you, which is impossible to bypass in any way.

Now I want to give some advice to the immature young people who are reading this post. I love life and want to continue living as joyfully as I did before, but now I'm having trouble sleeping and panic attacks, I have a hard time falling asleep because before I go to sleep I have thoughts that I have no idea how I'm going to close these debts. I think that for someone, situations like this can lead to more serious problems, up to and including suicidal thoughts, but I really want you to learn from other people's mistakes, including mine.

And my first piece of advice is that you shouldn't bet everything on cryptocurrency. I am quite young, but after graduating from school I didn't want to study further and get a profession, I didn't listen to my parents and chose the way of working in the Internet, I almost didn't succeed until I found cryptocurrency, I thought that my life had happened, but one day it collapsed and now without any skills I have to survive in this cruel world. You have to study first of all, you can parallel to this and do cryptocurrency, but never quit your studies, you have to be sure in your future. There are exceptions, like my acquaintance, who earned more than a million dollars on cryptocurrency even before graduating from school and, having withdrawn some money, decided to continue only in this direction. This also applies to people who rely only on their main job, some of my acquaintances are comfortable going to work every day, and after work they play games and watch TV shows, such people can also be out of work one day, as it was during the quarantine, so you should also try to get into other areas at least a little bit.

The second tip is an extension of the first - you must constantly learn new skills. Learn new languages, learn programming, draw, develop your social networks, whatever you like and can bring in good money. When you have certain skills it is easier for you to find a better paying job, unlike people who have no skills, such people can be easily replaced, and therefore they will be paid the least. Use bear market as an opportunity to become more educated, moreover such skills as programming will help you a lot in making money on cryptocurrency.

And the third tip may seem strange to you, but you should always consider yourself stupid in this market. As soon as you start thinking that you understand this market, or read it, they will take everything away from you.If you think you are stupider than others, it will be easier for you to take advice from more experienced people and consider two sides of the coin.

The fourth piece of advice should be your basic one - futures are evil. You will never make money on futures, it is a casino game in which you can win, but you will end up with empty pockets. You may be able to make money from it, but let me tell you, it doesn't just hit you in the pocket. You become more nervous and irritable looking at the charts all the time, it is like an abusive relationship, first the chart goes in your direction and you start to cheer, then it goes in the opposite direction and you become angry, it can happen dozens of times in a day, it is very exhausting and you start to make rash decisions, so please, never try to make money on futures. You can use futures to hedge your position, but never try to guess the direction, the world situation is changing very fast and you can never know how the world situation will change and how the markets will react, bitcoin can fall very fast and altcoins even faster, you just might not have time to close your position and lose everything.

Fifth tip - diversification is very important. If you managed to make money on cryptocurrency, then withdraw some money, invest it in more conservative assets. Buy an apartment, a car, maybe open a business will be the right decision, because after losing everything, you will be left with a roof over your head and probably with a business, which will feed you in difficult times.

The sixth tip is to ask for help and help others. This applies to those who are already in a similar situation, you may have just noticed that you are addicted to futures, you must recognize this problem and turn to your loved ones who can support you, there is no easy money, big money comes only through hard work. You have to completely give up the idea that you can make money on futures.

We all know what a bad mood is, but not everyone has faced great losses, I have never felt so bad in this life, so if your friend or loved one asks for help, try to support and help them, you never know what can happen to you and it's great if there is someone around to help you through any grief.

You can add your own tips in the comments that I may have missed or you may have made other mistakes. I really hope that my post will help someone realize their mistakes, come to their senses in time, and get on the right track.

218,"Contingent staking, is it the future of POS chains or something we should all fight against?",1188ev2,"The ADA community is divided, Charles is discombobulated and the argument remains - Is Contingent staking the future of ADA and other POS crypto currencies?

The simple definition of what contingent staking means is basically giving the staking pool operator the choice to implement some sort of conditions that would allow them to reject certain delegators that don't meet these conditions.

**examples:**

* Only US citizens can delegate their ADA to us - users must prove they are from the US
* Only non US citizens can delegate their ADA to us - users must prove they are outside of the US
* &#x200B;

Now I want to clarify that this at least at the moment seem like something that would be required by all staking pool operators but it would give them the option if they wanted to implement it. Delegators would also have the option to simply switch to a different staking pool that is not using contingent staking if they wanted to avoid it.

**The argument for Contingent Staking:**

This will allow staking pool operators to chose exactly who they allow to delegate with them and help them meet any local regulations where they are located, this will ensure that the staking pool operators can keep running instead of having to shut down due to fear of operating illegally.

**The argument against Contingent staking:**

This is going against the crypto ethos and leading to more centralization instead of against it. It's a slippery slope that will only lead to more changes in the future to keep appeasing regulators.

&#x200B;

So far this is only being discussed in the Cardano chain but it is possible that this could be implemented in other POS chains, Do you feel like this is something that is required for crypto to continue to move forward or something that we should do our best to avoid?",Odlavso,34,1,0.56

You can do it here but by clicking the big red SELL button and immediately executing a HUGE market order... By doing so you are very likely to paint a red dildo and suffer a huge slippage. Thus selling btc at a lower than optimal price.

... So instead of apeing in... you come up with a devious plan. You realize price is in a range for some time, hence, above the previous high (where a lot of people sold before) there are a bunch of protective stops. Those stops are nothing more than resting market BUY orders....  What if I buy some more BTC just enough so that I trigger those juicy stops. Those poor souls will buy BTC in order to cut losses on their early shorts or too high leverage.

... And so as the market pumps buy stops get triggered, joining them are FOMO retailers and breakout traders who further buy into your bags. If the your bags are big enough the price reverses. The downside movement is now triggering SELL stops of the breakout buyers at the top .. driving the price even further down. Red dildos create panic among retail and further fuel the sellings.

Seems that involving less math in the swap transaction requires less slippage. 
I always add .0000 to the amount of low cap tokens being swapped and use as many zeros in the amount as possible.
If I'm swapping for millions or billions of token; I want mostly zeros instead of the absolute most token that I can swap for. All those non zero integers under the hundred thousand decimal just complicate the transaction and seem to require more slippage. 

This has worked for me when swapping IN or OUT of small cap tokens.

Also note; small cap tokens with a tax or reflections do not affect the slippage. The tax or reflections are taken from the total amount swapped for, not added on top of whatever number tokens that you swap for.

Other causes for higher slippage are low liquidity, volatility in price movement, and high activity.

224,Bitcoin Mining Reward Sustainability - Can it survive the next few cycles?,1185jl6,"# Mining Cost Analysis

In the past we have seen significant price movement with each halving cycle.  However, price cannot go up forever.  What happens if price were to stay the same for a cycle? I attempted to do the math:

First, looking at network difficulty.  BTC's current Hash rate sits at 292.5 EH/s, with a block reward of 6.25 BTC and an average of 144 blocks mined per day.  Difficulty increases rapidly from year to year, with an average increase of 88% per year in the past 5 years.  For miners, this means that they will be making a fraction of their current profits after a year or two.  ASIC's become obsolete FAST.

&#x200B;

[BTC Hash Rate at the start of each year](https://preview.redd.it/khs4zfuxtjja1.jpg?width=380&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c43b1b114355bd7008f4c2e74fee49bf6f1324e3)

If price held stable at $25,000 - miners split the block rewards pool of $22.5M/day ($8.2B/year)

Next, lets look at mining equipment.  Currently, the Bitmain Antminer K7 is the most profitable ASIC you can buy, per [asicminervalue](https://www.asicminervalue.com/).  It generates 63.5 TH/s with a power consumption of 3080W, and sits at a current price of $5400.  If every single miner on the market met these specs, that would mean there are at minimum 4.6M of these machines, for a total hardware cost of $24B.  Adding in power costs (est \~$0.08/kWh) adds an extra $9.7B in overhead costs per year.  These values should be a significant underestimate, as most of the miners out there are less efficient.

&#x200B;

If price holds stable at $25,000 - miners split the block rewards pool of $22.5M/day ($8.2B/year).  Miners currently hold at least $24B in hardware, with at least $9.7B in added power costs per year.  **This means that the average cost of mining BTC is significantly higher than the current cost of BTC.**

# So what's next?:

BTC's reward halving model may lead to its downfall in the future, if nothing is done.  At current rates, we can expect a lot of miners to leave the market, as it is not profitable.  Network difficulty does automatically adjust for this, but technology increases still cause upward pressure on difficulty over time.  Mining equipment will always lose value over time.  We can expect the number of miners to decrease over the next few years.

Halving every 4 years further increases this problem.  Each cut in rewards essentially cuts in half the total number of miners that the market can sustain.  Without price movement, the network will lose security over time.

# What can be done?:

1. The band-aid solution that has worked in the past has been upward price movement.  Whether it has been due to market manipulation, network use, or sheer luck is up for you to decide.  We will eventually see limited price movements as the market share of BTC grows, this can not continue forever.
2. Option #2 is increasing miner revenue through network fees.  Personally I think this is inevitable .  At a current rate of 270K transactions per day, making up for the mining reward decrease for the next halving ($-4.1B) would cost \~$40 per each transaction.

All of this assumes that price holds consistent, which is obviously not realistic.  Due to the deflationary nature of the token, we should see an average increase in price per year, but it would take a price doubling every 4 years to sustain the current rewards model.  More than likely we will end up somewhere in the middle.

225,A super simple spreadsheet and formulas to track your LP profitability,11850da,"Over the past week, we've seen moon liquidity increase pretty dramatically.  With CCIP-051, it's likely many more users will add their moons to liquidity.  However, one thing that may be difficult for some users is tracking actual profitability and impermanent loss.

With LPs, it's very likely to have one of your assets go below the initial deposit amount.  However, if the other asset goes higher, and you can swap the gained asset amount and end up with greater total assets, you can consider yourself to be in profit.  However, if the gained asset amount cannot be swapped for the entire deficit, you as suffering impermanent loss.

What a great couple months for crypto. I am an eternal optimist so you won't see much doom and gloom talk from me.  I  am also aware that crypto doesn’t always go up.  Just not the type that celebrates bear market leverage trading. 

Thought I'd share what i think are good strategies with crypto. Yeah I know I am a big nobody. Got into crypto wrong time and road it down BUT I had good projects and back in the profit. Picked up a few gems last couple months that too.

I never go all in too early in new projects. Yeah I missed out on some major gains but a lot of new coins are super risky. Some will win Abd some will lose. 

Everyone always talking DCA BTC and ETH but they have already done 1000's of percent. Newer projects have more risk but considerable upside.Yeah and I still buy a little of those but not expecting anything huge from them.

I've learned recently that narratives are huge. Spend some time on social media and see what the degens are talking about.

Don't get to greedy. Have an exit plan with your coIns. Don’t be afraid of taking some profit or cutting losses if you realize you jumped into a bad project. I’ve Road a few down diamond handing and probably won’t see an upside.

I think it is safe to say that we all want more MOON and judging by the comments on this proposal it has increased interest in adding liquidity for MOON. One thing that gets mentioned that not everyone understands is impermanent loss. 

**Adding MOON Liquidity**

I have added liquidity twice to MOON. This was done at the very beginning when MOON just went to Arbitrum Nova. 

\~125 MOON and 0.005 ETH and \~90 MOON and 0.005 ETH

You can see the ratio of MOON/ETH is different since the value of MOON and ETH changed in the 2 days between adding liquidity.

**Total Added: 210 MOON and 0.010 ETH**

**Today LP Value: 161 MOON and 0.0168 ETH** (this includes \~6 months of fees)

Today I have $11.40 more ETH and $7.87 less MOON. I sold MOON to get the ETH to add liquidity. If I kept all 420 MOON and did not add liquidity, my crypto would be worth \~$74 instead of \~$58, a net 20%+ loss.

I added liquidity knowing that it would likely be a losing proposition but knowing that MOON needs to have liquidity to have value. I view that early LP adders were adding liquidity not to make money, but to better the ecosystem.

**If you expect MOON to increase at a rate faster than ETH, you likely will have more crypto if you did not add liquidity.** This does not mean that you shouldn't add liquidity, a concentrated liquidity pool is crucial for MOON long-term, but you should be aware that it likely will not be a net money maker.",pbjclimbing,107,20,0.62
229,Mass Adoption requires more Accessible and Safe Self-Custody.,1183dnv,"Hey guys, just wanted to talk a bit about self custody, it’s current state, and how this affects adoption. 

The most recent SEC regulations against exchange based staking etc have garnered many conversations that this may actually be good in the long term as it incentivises self-custody.  I tend to agree for the most part. What I want to express however is the current state of self custody and it’s future in mass-adoption of cryptocurrencies.  

Consider yourself, would you say you are of average intelligence? Are you relatively adept at using a computer? If so, at least 50% of the population are less capable than you. Do you think that self-custody is safer, easier, and more accessible than a regular bank account, which many already struggle to manage? I am all for decentralisation and self custody, however I think currently the ability for one to, for example, click one bad link and click agree to a bad smart contract, or lose a seed phrase, and thus lose everything is a massive vulnerability, even to those of us who are a bit more switched on. While normal bank accounts are no strangers to scams, the responsibility of self custody at the moment requires much greater scrutiny of security measures and safe keeping, and the sole responsibility of the owner.  For the average Joe, this may seem all too daunting, enough to put them off and hinder long term adoption.

How do you guys see self-custody changing in the future? How could it be made more accessible to the average consumer?  What changes do you think are required for widespread adoption of self-custody? Look forward to hearing your thoughts and counter-arguments.",VoucherBoy123,62,26,0.82

234,Everyone is talking about L2 zKEVMs on Ethereum but miss another major catalyst - decentralized trust on Ethereum via Eigenlayer,117yw69,"EigenLayer is built on Ethereum and enables users to restake their ETH and extend cryptoeconomic security of Ethereum to additional applications such as oracles, bridges, L2s on the network.

A current challenge within blockchains is fragmented security. This is especially true on the Ethereum network. At a very high level, middleware and non-EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) applications built on top of Ethereum are responsible for generating their own trust network - unlike dapps, which are secured on the smart contract level. 
This is inefficient in many ways. Self maintained security is expensive, resource-intensive, and takes a considerable time to generate. Moreover, once launched, a decentralized security network requires ongoing effort to scale. 

EigenLayer launches a mechanism in cryptoeconomic security called “restaking” to overcome these challenges and aggregate security across Ethereum. Restaking functions as a set of smart contracts in which users that stake ETH can repurpose their locked ETH to extend cryptoeconomic security to other applications built on the network, basically lending out trust of the main chain. Ultimately, EigenLayer’s design allows staked ETH to provide validation services - for additional staking fees - beyond just Ethereum itself.

Advantages of Eigenlayer:
- Developers can begin to focus more on innovation and building products, and less on bootstrapping security
- For end users, restaking presents a significant improvement in value accrual opportunities. Stakers today essentially lock their capital to earn a reward for contributing to network security. However, they must forgo other opportunities to do so. The advent of liquid staking derivatives and restaking creates more capital efficiency by enabling token holders to deploy the staking derivative capital elsewhere to earn additional yield
- Restaking improves Ethereum fee model since it creates a flow of value that grows along with the network

Eigenlayer just today released their whitepaper and soon expects to launch their testnet, the release of the product is expected later in 2023.

TLDR: Eigenlayer allows Ethereum to lend out its network security to EVM compatible projects, saving them money and efforts and give additional staking returns to stakers willing to take on additional slashing risks",Antana18,22,7,0.6
235,Any examples of failed/scam crypto businesses compensating customers in the end?,117yn23,"
Apologies if this is a noob question or if it's been answered before. I'm new to the space and I'm still trying to understand the history of crypto so far. I keep seeing posts of people saying once you've lost the money it's gone. I know there's a difference between scams and failed businesses but I guess I'm wondering if there are any examples of people being fairly compensated either through law enforcement action or by the founders of these businesses in the past and how that worked out.

I know that in the Coffeezilla Cryptozoo scam it took a YouTube investigator to post a public investigation to get the promise of compensation for investors. Even then it's just a promise until it happens. In the American based businesses it seems that people get a fraction of their investments back after many years. I haven't come across solid businesses that genuinely failed due to external factors that may have actually tried to make their investors whole again so far. Are there any? 

This is obviously discounting the Do Kwon type of scammers who ran off with the money specifically to evade accountability.",FuzzyLogic411,36,12,0.75
236,Arbitrum one,117yeu0,"For those who still wondering on the sidelines whether or not they should get back into crypto. I would suggest looking at Arbitrum one projects. There is already projects doing incredibly well like GMX, GNS, generating millions in trading volume fees due to being a decentralized trading platform. I've always been a risk seeking person so personnel always try to target smaller cap coins with larger upside potential. A few include JOE and GRAIL.

I think the difference now already been in the bear market not even a bull market is project having utility before launching a token most time there's promises of this being done in the future and then just hope for the best and they actually do it this time around they actually do have the project already making revenue from fees etc. Once you send ETH instantly, free of charge, you'll realize the opportunity.",Wolf_of_Dorpstreet,43,4,0.65

Wife said our tax guy had a client who lost a decent fortune on FTX and was asking if I lost any on anything like that since his mind was absolutely blown how much money i earned and had to pay taxes on crypto last year.

I said no. Only reason I lied to my wife in the moment was because she asked in front of her parents. Her parents were in town the week it happened, in fact I was looking for my ledgers so i could transfer my BTC to it when i heard the Celsius FUD beginning. But i couldnt find them quick enough and was busy hosting a huge family BBQ so i just tried to focus on spending time with family (and not food poisoning the family). But very next day—withdrawals were paused.  

So it was a white lie, but i said it. Didnt want them to feel responsible. It’s not a huge amount of money—i mean it is, but only about 1/7th of my crypto. Will have to clarify with wife in private. She’ll flip, but shes just not good with money anyways. I only lost money i had from crypto specifically because i had it in the first place—bcuz of crypto",moonRekt,53,2,0.5

Whether it was an automated process, the wallet tests out any contract and gives you a simple result (sent x ETH to y).

In the last week or so, and investigation was announced by the SEC into Paxos. Shortly after that, I got an email from IB and Paxos with instructions about how to move my crypto off the stock exchange to a Paxos wallet.

I’m wondering at this point if it would be a good idea to get the crypto out of Paxos completely. Off my brokerage account, to Paxos, then off to my cold wallet.

Wondering about peoples thoughts about the Paxos investigation. I am not exactly sure what would happen if Paxos ran into problems, but I am concerned my BTC would be at risk. Not sure if a forced liquidation would be required or something similar.

240,The gusty tale of a new avid investor (Don't be like me),117w1g8,"Be me, a person who knew about crypto since 2017 when my irrational friend (What we all thought at that time) bought a few of the top coins and did not sell, all the way to losing more than half of his initial investment. He actually did not sell and kept buying and ended up selling in 2021 at around 60 k BTC.

Now where was I in all of this? I ignored all his advices and classified his choices as too risky and gambling-like. When I first started my new job, I got into small time mining at the start of 2021 and little by little saw its potential. At this point it was too late, however, by the time I invested in crypto, at one point I was actually up by 40%!. But surprise surprise, the human greed that I so boldly claimed that I won't have, well, had me big time. My friend even told me to sell at 60 K  BTC but I arrogantly told him off and that all those youtuber thumbnails said that it will go to 100 K EOY! Rode my bag all the way before I messed up again, sold at a -70%. This bear market I have adapted and I am waiting for take off if it happens, and will buy more if it dumps.

What I learned?

1) Listen to veterans, they know best (An advice is still an advice and they can be mistaken).

2) Don't listen to YouTube thumbnails with gaping mouth like orifices and shills (Insane rug pull potential)

2) Learn to take profits if necessary, don't religiously take goals absolutely (For example, don't sell only when BTC reaches 100 k).

3) Timing in the market is more important than timing the market (Unless you cracked the code and are part of the 5% elite who successively beat the market in short term trading).

4) Invest mainly in blue chips, but keep some money aside from promising projects, and the bare minimum for meme coins because why the hell not?

5) Set a realistic DCA out just like you would with a DCA in, don't let fear and greed control your buys and sells (Start selling from 69 k BTC to 99 K for example).

6) Don't keep all your eggs in one basket (Several exchange hot wallet, cold physical wallets) and write down all of your key phrases and store them safely.

7) Always learn to do your own research (Like I should have done with EOS).

Feel free to add to the list to help raise awareness from personal failures and success stories.

241,Opinion: Lessons learned after 4 years of dealing with crypto,117v8f4,"Since about 2018 I have been semi-passively interested in crypto. During these last 4 years, I dipped my toes into a few most famous coins/tokens like ETH, BTC, CRO, etc, and a few meme ones. Noways I still have about $5k split between ETH and BTC on one of the major crypto exchanges. This investment represents only a tiny percent of my net worth. If next year crypto drops another 50% I will be disappointed but not financially broke. Here are some thoughts and lessons learned:

\- Crypto is still and will be for a while a new frontier. If you want to play safe just buy some BTC and/or ETH on a single major US/EU-based crypto exchange and forget about it. You can now stack your ETH2 and get some % back while you wait. It's one of the safer exposures to crypto in my opinion.

\- Do not chase hype coins. The crypto market is mostly hype-driven. You might get lucky when the hype is rising, but then you will burn when the hype dies down. In fact, many of these coins move along with ""blue-chip"" crypto like BTC and ETH (meaning if BTC is falling, usually everything else is also falling).

\- There is an exception to the previous point I made. The crypto market is also ""whale""-driven. Large sums of tokens are concentrated in a hands of a minority of people(or wallets), who can move prices up and down through the means of speculation. It is easy enough, especially on non-English speaking forums and chats, to find a group of individuals who create these ""waves"" in supply and demand of a particular token. There used to be people who would do the same with the stock market, but it was made illegal. Crypto markets are much more open, thus anyone from any part of the world could mess with them. 

\- Be honest with yourself and do not call yourself an ""investor"". You are gambling with your money. There is nothing wrong with occasional gambling for fun, but do not bet away your or your loved ones' life savings.

\- If you care about filing taxes, do yourself a favor and stick to a single exchange. You will thank me later next tax year. Every trade you make is a taxable event; You might get sing up bonus here and there and trade/transfer some meme coins between wallets, but every single activity you perform with your crypto makes your taxes more complicated and more expensive to file. In fact, depending on how much you made, you might find yourself spending all your winnings to pay different 3rd parties to help you to file taxes properly.

\- Do yourself a favor and stick to a single exchange due to a different reason: contrary to good old cash, every time you want to do anything with your crypto you must pay a fee. If you are a gambler on a budget, you will quickly see how your balance gets drained with every single transaction you make. If you decide to trade on a single exchange, be aware of ""spread"" (a hidden fee), you never get 1 for 1 in terms of comparable market value between two tokens.

\- It's quite possible that the crypto market will double by date X, but it's also possible that the stock market will double by the same date. Yes, there are tokens that will produce 500% by date X, but it's quite possible that there are also stocks that will produce 500% by the same date. If you want to speculate, or even properly invest in something, try the stock market for starters as it's not only a safer option thanks to government regulations and consumer protection laws, but also a much more mature market.

\- Blockchain is a great and promising technology. After all this mess, there will be use cases that will drastically affect/improve our lives. On other hand, Bitcoin won't replace the dollar or cash, in fact, some governments might switch to a digital currency at some point that will be based on blockchain technology, but they will be the ones to reap the benefits and not the people who invested in coin X and hodled through all the years.

I personally plan to keep my BTC and ETH untouched until I really need money for some large purchase like a house. I sold all other coins/tokens for a loss and got rid of all my wallets and all but one exchange. From now on I will try to keep transactions to a minimum, so next year I am not paying extra to file taxes here in the US. If I decide I want more exposure to crypto I will simply buy more BTC or ETH, or invest in Coinbase or Square stock on US markets.

*According to conventional wisdom, an annual ROI of approximately 7% or greater is considered a good ROI for an investment in stocks. This is also about the average annual return of the S&P 500, accounting for inflation.*

That said, back in January, 5th 2018, before the first major crash, The total MCAP was about 780 Billion. 

Right now,  it's hovering around 1.13 Trillion. That leaves it with annual ROI of over 7%.

From 1/5/2018 to 1/5/2023, the total MCAP would have to be around 1.093 Trillion.  

So as of now 2/20/2023, it sits at 1.13. exceeding the minimum standards to be considered a good long term investment.

If we are here we believe in crypto and what Reddit is doing is the next level.
IPO indeed will bring as well new possibilities. With tons on cash available development of this environment can only go faster.

244,A brief overview of the pioneers in the early digital currency world prior to modern cryptocurrencies.,117snl4,"Its surprising to see that there were several attempts at digital currency prior to Satoshi's whitepaper on bitcoin.  Here is a short list I found interesting.

&#x200B;

* B-Money: B-Money was a proposal for a decentralized digital currency that was created by computer scientist Wei Dai in 1998. like bitcoin  B-Money also proposed the use of a proof-of-work mechanism to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the network, which is similar to the proof-of-work mechanism used by the Bitcoin network - there was a fascinating read where Wei was thinking about to make the stable the value, basically ideas for stable coin.

&#x200B;

* DigiCash: Founded in 1989, DigiCash was a company that developed a digital currency called Cyberbucks ( yes its sort of like meme coin name haha) which could be used to make online payments. Similar to bitcoin  DigiCash also used cryptographic techniques to ensure the security and privacy of its transactions, similar to how Bitcoin uses cryptography to secure its network.

&#x200B;

* E-Gold:  about 1996, E-Gold was one of the earliest digital currencies and allowed users to make online payments using a form of digital gold.  Like Bitcoin though, E-Gold operates on a decentralized network and eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries, such as banks, to verify transactions. Instead, E-Gold uses a form of digital gold as the underlying asset for its currency, which is stored on the network and can be used to make online payments.
* HashCash: HashCash was a proof-of-work system that was created in 1997 to combat spam email. It was one of also on of the first systems to use a proof-of-work mechanism, which of course is now a key component of the Bitcoin network.

edit: as pointed below by u/kisstheraino

there is also e-cash

>In 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum proposed a form of e cash. He conceptualized a token currency that could be transferred between individuals safely and privately; the similarities to modern-day cryptocurrencies are striking.  
>  
>Chaum developed a so-called ""blinding formula"" to be used to encrypt information passed between individuals. ""Blinded Cash"" could thus be safely transferred between individuals, bearing a signature of authenticity and the ability to be modified without traceability.

For those that make a lot, I think that you will hear many ""you're an idiot"" comments along the way. The voice in your head might say ""Tell them I TOLD YOU SO"". Please read this, I think it brings real value.

On December 19, 2013 it already had a large pump rising from $0.00026 to $0.00095 (nearly 300%). Then 3 days later it crashed, losing 80% of its value.

There's a lot of history behind the coin. With hacks, large pumps and the community getting together to ""SaveDogemas"", to help those who had their coins stolen.

I won't be going deep into the story behind Doge. I was more curious about when Dogecoin started appearing on the top50 list. The earliest date that I could find on CoinMarketCap where Dogecoin appears in the top50 is December 18, 2013.

This is notable for a couple reasons.
1. If Bitcoin mining is proven to be non-sustainable, the US government is sure to regulate mining operations under the pretense of reducing carbon emissions.

2. As long as BTC is considered to have a negative impact  on the environment, ESG investment is impossible.

It turns out that the CCAF article left out a few key factors including but not limited to:
- Off-grid mining
- Flare-gas mining
- Updated geographical hash rate

250,Why is nobody talking about how extreme Grayscale's current discount to NAV is?,117qj2f,"Grayscale is currently trading at over a 46% discount to NAV, the all time number peaked in December at over a 48% discount. That's close to double the BTC value per dollar.

I'm not an expert on any of this. I know that users can't redeem funds, but their plan is to offer a tender for redemption if they lose against the SEC and don't manage to convert to a spot ETF.

*\*edit\* after more research, the tender they are going to offer is a 20% buyback on shares, which I assume means they would sell BTC worth 20% of their NAV and use it to buy back shares and distribute them to holders at that NAV value? I'd love clarity on this part.*

I am of the understanding on the other side that if they do win their case and successfully convert to a spot ETF that it will be a vector for entry for many sectors of the market who can't currently buy BTC, but can currently use GBTC to short.

So here are my questions

**1: Why do you guys believe it's trading so far below NAV despite an intention to tender if the ETF falls through.**

Please explain if I'm wrong, but does this mean that if you bought Grayscale today, they lost their case next year, and issued a tender for redemption because of it, that BTC would need to be trading below $12000 USD at that time for current owners of the stock to run a loss?

**2: Isn't it almost a guarantee that if they win their case against the SEC and are allowed to convert to a spot ETF that their price to NAV will go on an absolute tear?**

I know at points they have traded above NAV when people expected their spot ETF to get approved. So shouldn't this mean an asymetrically likely win for retail buyers in either outcome?

**3: Is the below NAV trading price essentially a 'short' from traders who expect BTC to drop in the future and also expect the ETF application to fail?**

If that's the case, at the current rate is that short only successful if BTC trades below 12K USD?

What am I missing here. Outside of the self custody argument (believe me I get this), what reason do I have for not buying Grayscale if I'm in BTC long term? I think a 2% fee is dirt relative to BTC's likely growth rate, and it'd be like 20 years to offset the current discount, right?",chance_waters,27,5,0.59
251,Blockchains can disrupt these 7 industries,117q84q,"I asked a certain large language model to summarize the industries that are most likely to be disrupted by blockchain. Here is what it said:

&#x200B;

*""Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt a variety of industries by providing a decentralized and secure system for data management and transfer. Here are some industries that are likely to be disrupted by blockchain technology:*

1. *Finance: The finance industry is one of the most obvious targets for blockchain disruption. The traditional banking system is based on a centralized system of control, which leaves it vulnerable to corruption, fraud, and hacking. Blockchain technology can provide a decentralized and secure alternative to this system, allowing for faster and more efficient transactions, lower fees, and increased transparency.*
2. *Healthcare: Blockchain technology can be used to securely store and manage patient data, allowing for more efficient sharing of information between healthcare providers. This can lead to better healthcare outcomes, more accurate diagnoses, and reduced medical errors.*
3. *Real Estate: The real estate industry is another sector that could benefit from blockchain technology. By using blockchain, real estate transactions can be completed faster and with greater security, while reducing the need for intermediaries and streamlining the entire process.*
4. *Supply Chain: Blockchain technology can be used to create a secure and transparent supply chain, allowing for more efficient tracking of products and greater visibility into the production process. This can help reduce waste, prevent counterfeiting, and improve product safety.*
5. *Energy: The energy industry is another sector that could benefit from blockchain technology. By using blockchain, energy transactions can be made more efficiently, while reducing the need for intermediaries and streamlining the entire process.*
6. *Voting: The traditional voting system is vulnerable to hacking and fraud. By using blockchain technology, voting can be made more secure, transparent, and efficient. This could lead to increased voter turnout, greater accuracy, and more trust in the electoral process.*
7. *Gaming: Blockchain technology can be used to create a secure and transparent gaming system, allowing for more efficient transactions and greater visibility into the gaming process. This can help prevent cheating, improve user experience, and reduce fraud.*

*Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries by providing a secure and transparent alternative to traditional systems. While it is still early days for blockchain, the technology is rapidly evolving and has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. As such, it is important for businesses to understand the potential of blockchain technology and be prepared to adapt to the changes that it may bring.""*

1. find a few promising cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and projects that you believe in, such as ETH, MATIC, XRP, and of course, BTC.
2. Transfer these coins to a wallet and write down the seed phrase on a piece of paper, keeping it safe in a secure location. don't get too fancy with this, just write it as follows and maybe try to memorize it for extra backup down the road.
3. Delete any trading apps or websites you use, and disconnect from all cryptocurrency news, forums, and other sources of market information. Avoid checking the market altogether.
4. Don't gamble your crypto. Like stated above, anything with risky leverage is just gambling, but also don't fall for predatory crypto casinos, YOU WILL ALWAYS LOSE.
5. Make a plan to DCA (or don't) to keep adding small amounts here and there and build your portfolio over time. 
6. Enjoy your life for a few years, free from worries about your crypto investments. Pursue your interests and have fun.
7. After a few years, check the value of your portfolio and use your newfound wealth to purchase whatever you desire.


TLDR:
DCA, DCA, DCA. Don’t get fancy.

254,Are Centralized Cryptocurrencies Antithetical to the Core Values of Cryptocurrency?,117ob4y,"Cryptocurrency was born out of a desire to create a decentralized financial system that operates independently of governments and financial institutions. 

However, as the popularity of cryptocurrency has grown, so has the emergence of centralized cryptocurrencies.

For context: centralized cryptocurrencies are created and managed by a central authority, usually a private company, rather than a decentralized network of users. This central authority typically controls the supply and distribution of the cryptocurrency, and may also have the power to freeze or reverse transactions.

So, the question is: are centralized cryptocurrencies antithetical to the core values of cryptocurrency? 

On one hand, some argue that the emergence of centralized cryptocurrencies goes against the very essence of cryptocurrency, which is to create a decentralized financial system that is free from the control of any central authority. They argue that centralized cryptocurrencies are simply traditional financial systems masquerading as cryptocurrency, and that they undermine the true potential of cryptocurrency to revolutionize the way we transact and store value.

On the other hand, proponents of centralized cryptocurrencies argue that they offer a number of advantages over decentralized cryptocurrencies, such as greater speed and lower transaction fees. They also argue that a degree of centralization is necessary to ensure stability and prevent fraud, and that centralized cryptocurrencies can help to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and the world of cryptocurrency.

So, what do you think? 

Are centralized cryptocurrencies antithetical to the core values of cryptocurrency, or do they have a place in the world of cryptocurrency?",membrane32,21,2,0.7
255,Is BTC a phenomena?,117o57f,"Is BTC responsible for the popularity of all cryptocurrencies? With all the arguments against BTC not offering many use cases or its limited TPS, is what makes it special the fact it was first and, now, has the longest track record of uptime and minimal security breaches? Was the first mover advantage and its time being mass adopted, what led it to now having a permanent place in the cryptosphere? Does it deserve the credit for all cryptocurrencies having the reputation of being secure?

I've started to view BTC from the lens of it having no intrinsic value but is now priced at $24,000 a coin and led to world of cryptos valued at over $1T. In a digital age, there is value to an ultimately secured database and the participants of the database can speculate on its value. It makes sense that this database would be used to represent and transact money. It would also make sense that subsequent blockchains would build off its fundamentals.

BTC is at the center of this movement. It's phenomena is the spark, or big bang, of the world of cryptocurrencies. Without BTC, would other popular cryptos have their market cap?",OpticallyMosache,37,3,0.55

They will think about hundreds stupid pseudo scientific reasons to dismiss new technology, similar to medieval peasants talking about witches. 

It happen since always, some people called muskets magical demonic fire, some   hated railway and cars and called it steel devils, they thought photos steal souls,  phones  cause brain cancer or infertility, internet brainwash kids and it is just temporary, and much more. In 1930's famous article  said ""TV have no future, cause people won't like to waste time looking at some box for whole hour or two""... Suprise, suprise, now everyone have their own mini box in pocket, and most can't live without looking at them for hours.

 In 1990's and early 2000's many people including Noble Prize winner in Economy or bilionaire Warren Buffet told internet have no practical uses and within few years will be forgotten. Mobile phones 25 years ago were toy for the rich people, now are necessity. World change, technology too. You can either be hero and promote changes or become another boomer complaining about everything. In 20 years all those people talking about crypto being a scam etc. will become as wrong as those guys from  interviews from early 2000's talking that internet won't survive, when today we  cam watch records of those inteviews on yt.

In 20 years, most of crypto haters will be either dead from old age or converted on crypto at least a bit. Often they won't have a choice  but to participate, when their medical records will be stored on blockchain and their bank will put part of their savings  into BTC. No one asked haters if they want to use mobile phones, e-mails or internet in general, we just simply  did it and they had no other choice than to participate or lose jobs.

 Difference is that sooner you join some new tech, easier and less painful it is. Those that used computers and internet since 1990's  have it much easier than someone that started 20 years later. Same with crypto, joining today is more profitable, offer more time to learn and more opportunities and we at least can proudly say we made free choice and weren't forced. While people that are against crypto  today may wake up in 5 or 10 years and learn their company adapted crypto and no one care whatever they like it or not.

How come in a space that literally came to be through sheer creativity and innovation, some people just completely lose the ability to see possibility and instead try to resist or mock it in any way possible.

Same with NFT technology in general. It almost seems as if it's impossible for some around here to see what these are, technologies. Possibilities for innovation  and development.

And yeah, I can already hear all the arguments against these things. But so many people lost the ability to see what *could* happen.

To solve this, Firozbad city police introduced a Police complaint portal powered by Polygon blockchain.
Once the complaint is registered, it can’t be manipulated!

California DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) is making it easy by putting car titles on Tezos blockchain to track the ownership of cars.

Did you know there are other ways to earn Moons as well? From writing about Crypto projects to making Memes. Here are all the ways you can earn Moons in the CryptoCurrency Ecosystem!

# I. Earning Karma on the CryptoCurrency Sub:

No list for earning Moons would be complete without this obvious number one. By Earning karma on the CryptoCurrency Sub you are then eligible for moons in the Distribution that happens every four weeks! Although the amount of Moons you earn per upvote changes every distribution, the last few snapshots have been almost 1 Moon for every 1 Karma you earned on this sub!

# II. Voting in CCIP proposals: (for a bonus on earned Karma)

CCIP proposals are the subs form of governance, but you might not know - voting in a CCIP proposal gives you a karma bonus on future snapshots. Your first vote gives you an extra  5% Karma on top of what you earned. Every  vote after gives you a 1.25% karma bonus. So with 4 CCIP Proposals this round, you can earn an extra 8.75% Moons on the next snapshot in 23 days.

264,What will be the 2023 version of the 2020 dump?,117ic8j," Back in 2020, if the pandemic did not occur, there would have been a high chance that crypto wouldn't have been dumped to the same lows of 2019. Maybe it would just have some corrections and crabbing up until the BTC halving has occurred. We are now in 2023 and if no ""catastrophic"" event is to happen, do you reckon that we might not go below 25 k and just crab between 25 to 35 k? IMHO a Binance (Bye-nance?) crash level might produce the same effect as the 2020 pandemic. 

TLDR: If no catastrophic event happens, then crabbing will ensue, otherwise we might see new drops to 14-15 k USD per BTC. Thoughts?

265,HEX has no use case and in essence acts as a scam and a ponzi - please stay away,117hyfu,"# What is Hex?

HEX is a token on the Ethereum network that advertises itself as a way to earn 40% per year with “certificates of deposit.” Hex is different because it’s being sold as an investment furnishing returns, uses banking terminology, and is heavily marketed out in the real world attempting to draw in people who don’t know what to look out for when it comes to crypto scams. Its founder/CEO, Richard Heart, claims that HEX is a far superior store of value than Bitcoin and guarantees those who HODL high rewards.

&#x200B;

# Relentless shilling

HEX gets shilled a LOT on social media and unfortunately, HEX also gets shilled on Reddit. An example:

Even though HEX is typically blacklisted here. Some posts/comments fall through the cracks, as TNG said today:

&#x200B;

# Hex should be avoided

Yet Hex is anything but a good project. Hex uses scam tactics (e.g. referral bonusses and get-rick-quick-schemes), has no use-case, and uses a ponzi mechanism staking scheme. Bybit summarizes these points very well:

https://preview.redd.it/mc50m9z27eja1.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=32ee2f901beeafb3171a0bd7d3c34636247ce09a

Not to mention that Richard Heart owns the large majority of all HEX tokens (some say 90%) and is just waiting to dump them. All top 150 token holders were created within an hour and have the same amount of Hex. Who own's these? You guessed it, Richard Heart.

266,Captain Obvious to the Rescue! Why We Don't Have to Listen to Influencers When Investing in Cryptocurrency.,117hmie,"**Captain Obvious advice!**

As we all know celebrities have a lot of influence on public opinion and their statements can manipulate people.

1. **They are not financial experts:** Being famous doesn't mean that they are experts in finance or investing. They could have access to financial advisors but they are still not qualified to give investment advice.
2. **Their motivations may be different:** They may be looking to make quick profit promoting an specific coin or project to make them gain. Always remember that other peoples interests may not be aligned with yours. So following their advice could make you lose money.
3. **They may have insider information:** When you are rich or famous new doors opens so they can have access to privileged information so they can play with that.
4. **Their words are powerful and can manipulate the market:** Clear example about this is Elon with his stupid tweets. This people use this to generate FOMO and again try to make them gain.

Always Do Your Own Research and NEVER take other people advice or words seriously without the proper DYOR and always ask yourself WHY are they saying that?

So at what point do you think we could reasonably say that crypto has reached 'mass adoption'? And what challenges would your definition have that wouldn't apply to another definition?

There were even times when we had no real Bitcoin price chart and no way to actually now the current value of one Bitcoin, so the price was usually made by sell offers that went up for certain amounts. One of earliest ones happened on February 20th 2010.

On that date someone sold 160 BTC that he/she mined with just the use of 1 kWh energy, for the lowest price ever recorded at $0.003 cents as that person thought Bitcoin to be overvalued at 5 cents during that time. Now those 160 BTC would be worth $4M and at the ATH even $11M.

Here is the official comment from that person on the bitcoin sub:

While many may now call this person a fool, that is absolutely not true. Only a crazy person back then could have thought that Bitcoin will ever be worth even more than $1.

269,"I personally tried a P2E game for the first time, and I'm really impressed!",117g0rz,"I recently tried a game called evio. Honestly it has been a great experience. We often hear P2E  games get criticized for over-complicating things, especially on crypto novices, which might be true for the most part, but I feel like this is changing.

I still remember when I tried to play Axie on mobile, I was instantly asked to connect my wallet and to fund it( I'm not sure about the funding part tbh, it was long ago). Anyway, in this game, You aren't asked to connect a wallet or even make an account to start playing, you can do that later if you like to though.

It's an FPS game and rather addictive( played like twenty matches on a row). Apart from that, the ecomomics seemed solid ( not refering to tokenomics here). I get money from buying NFTs that boost my income, the game makes money from selling NFTs and from in-game ads (displayed on the walls of buildings). It seems like a win-win.

Not only that, but many guilds are renting out NFTs for players to use within the game to earn more while enjoying 40% passive income from whatever the player earns. I have seen multiple four digit tournaments for the game as well, and prizes are paid in crypto.

TLDR: The crypto gaming sector is advancing rapidly and becoming more user-friendly. At this rate, it might onboard many web2 players into web3, further growing the ecosystem. I'm bullish on this sector long term.  I suggest you try out some web3 games to learn more about them, it might be the best way to make an investment decision( along with tokenomics etc).",Sylerb,48,0,0.42
270,Predictions to EOY 2026,117f6ea,"No doubt heading into bitcoin halving and potentially a new cycle we are going to see a lot of predictions start to be thrown around, from Peter Schiff ($0) to Cathy Wood ($10M) and every number in between by so called experts and media personalities.

Obviously no one actually knows and I pretty much disregard all of it but am interested in what this subreddit thinks and if everyone thinks the same or there are lots of opposing opinions. It will be nice to see heading into the halving, but also I plan to come back to this post in 2027 and re-look at what the responses were. It will be cool if someone calls it pretty accurately.

Do you think there will be another bull run like we have had in the past?

If you had to put a single number on it, how high do you think the bitcoin price will go?

In which month and year do you think the next peak will be?

How far will we fall next bear market percentage wise from top to bottom?

Will there be an alt season and will most of the large cap alt coins make new highs?

Will meme coins like doge and shiba outperform or underperform?

271,"It doesn't matter how many times you lose in crypto, cause you need to win only once or twice to make life changing money.",117f0hb,"Most of use lost many times  in crypto or in real life too. And it is fine, what is important is getting up again and learning on your mistakes to not make the same mistake twice. If you improve whole time, you will be better and better so fail less times and also gain more good
 opportunities. 

Only fool do the same thing twice and expect the same twice as Einstein said. If you invest in one shitcoin, don't be a fool to fall for the same trick second time. Best crypto investors didn't become rich but avoiding all risk  or making right choice every time. They become successful due to improvement, as long as you have bigger profits  than losses in long term you will be fine.

If you lose all or most money  it is not any end of the world, even if most people lose once or twice  gave up. They  run away from crypto and either never come back or come back after few years and most likely lose again, cause they never learned anything new in the meanwhile. If you constantly lose in crypto time after time, but learn something from every time you will be very successful in long term, maybe not in 1 or 2 years, but in 10 years definitely.

Great stock traders, famous stock investors or anyone else who achieved success aren't great and successful cause they get everything from the beginning, but cause they failed multiple times and get up over and over. You should diversify and invest in BTC and ETH to HODL, so even if most your decisions  in crypto will be stupid and unsuccessful, still in long term you will have at least small profit. And will be able to try new opportunities. It is about menaging risk. Don't look for next x100 coin, just be here do your job and most likely in year or three you will find a project you will believe in and make crazy money on it. If it will happen no one, even yourself will remember all bad choices you made. You will be grateful all losses and mistakes turned you into someone who was able make right decision.

Also what is the best many opportunities in crypto are free, by just being in space you get money, good examples are moons or Reddit Avatars, some people spend zero money, just are here do what they would do anyway and get profits from it. So even if you lost most your money and think about giving up on crypto you can try just being here and using free opportunities.",Nuewim,64,0,0.42
272,How the IRS Tracks Crypto,117eons,"Believe it or not, the IRS CAN tack your crypto.

Let's break down a few ways they can:

First, crypto exchanges report 1099 forms to the IRS. This means that the IRS knows how much you bought, sold, or traded in cryptocurrency. Make sure to report this information accurately on your tax return! 

Second, the IRS will sue exchanges for user information. This could include some of your personal information. Be aware that your crypto activity is not as anonymous as you might think. 

Third, the IRS will follow activity from centralized exchanges. They can track your transactions on the blockchain and link them to your personal information. Keep this in mind when using exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. 

Finally, the IRS will trace funds from cash accounts. If you're using cash to buy cryptocurrency, the IRS will look for patterns and investigate any suspicious activity. 

In short, the IRS is getting smarter about tracking cryptocurrency activity. Be sure to report your crypto activity accurately on your tax return and keep accurate records.

273,Analysis of Front Running Scams Bots,117ek9v,"I'm going to try to introduce you to a type of scam that I think is resurfacing at the moment. I've seen it passed around quite a few times on social networks and even on Reddit.  I am not an expert on the subject but I hope to enlighten some people and especially to prevent some novices from being scammed.

Finally, I'm going to show you ONE way this scam works, although you can imagine that there are many creative alternatives.

This crypto scam promises to make you several hundred dollars a day with a Solidity bot that uses the front running principle.

# First of all, what are we talking about?

I will answer this question quite simply with an explanation found on the Certik website (sources below):

>*Front running* is the process of utilizing inside knowledge of an unconfirmed transaction to conduct a trade *ahead* of the original one, essentially beating it to the punch and taking all the profit on offer.  
>  
>Each blockchain has a ***mempool*** or *transaction pool*.  
>  
>The scam we analyze here operates on the Ethereum network which uses a mempool.  
>  
>In short, when a transaction is conducted on a blockchain it needs to be validated first. This is because blockchains are immutable, they cannot be changed afterwards.  
>  
>Transactions need to be checked for errors, and be confirmed by validators that they adhere to the rules of the network, *before* they are made live. When a user submits a transaction, it will sit in the mempool until a validator approves it. Transaction fees are the price users pay for validators to perform this work. A higher transaction fee (also called *gas fee*) increases the chance that a validator will pick up their transaction.  
>  
>Users can access the mempool and view pending transactions, which means they can also see unconfirmed trades. A front runner will submit their own transaction to take advantage of another transaction. They’ll pay a higher gas fee to ensure the validators process the front running transaction first.

[ Front running process](https://preview.redd.it/kzkt5fxmidja1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c261de808ea55eeb58b7f1e45b6684701fe56ed7)

>In practice, there are other variables to take into account, such as *slippage*. Slippage occurs when the price of the token changes in the time between a user submitting a transaction to the mempool and it being confirmed on the blockchain. Slippage settings can protect a user from large fluctuations in a token's price when buying and selling. If the price moves more than the allowed slippage between the user submitting the transaction and validators approving it, the transaction will be rejected, saving the user from paying a much worse price than the one they agreed upon.  
>  
>Slippage protection kicks in if a transaction would have resulted in a negative outcome for the user. For example, imagine a user's slippage is set to 0.5%. If they sell tokens and the price increases 10%, the transaction will still go through as it's beneficial to the user. But if they were on the other side of the transaction, setting their slippage tolerance to 0.5% would prevent them from buying tokens at a 10% markup.  
>  
>Tokens with low liquidity will often advise setting slippage much higher to ensure transactions go through.

&#x200B;

[Slippage](https://preview.redd.it/8gczvad0jdja1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7baac6466820f147ac517bfb20ba3112961bb337)

&#x200B;

# But then how can such a ""complicated"" concept for a novice become so appealing?

It all starts with YouTube videos and a lot of comments under them. The videos are often short and very instructive, the victim is even reassured by ""checking"" the smart contract and the addresses present in it:

[Smart contract code](https://preview.redd.it/6uuyqo3mjdja1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0c72ce70ee3537d7391bde97b5a109c5f04461b8)

After a first quick look, we return our variables with the correctly associated wETH token ([https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2)).

The repositories to Uniswap are also original addresses. As for the formulas for the front-running part, it is very complex but it seems coherent.

The actor then directs viewers to go to Remix, which is a genuine tool used for testing and deploying smart contracts.

Viewers are told to connect their Metamask wallet to Remix. So, as in the video, you will create a ""bot.sol"" file, then copy and paste the code into that file.

In the end, you find absolutely nothing suspicious and decide to continue the experiment. So you compile your code as in the tutorial and there. Wonderful, everything seems to work fine.

Finally, the last step, deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain. You click on the Deploy button. The window allowing to check the MetaMask transaction appears and you validate, everything seems correct, the fees are consistent, the action allows to create the smart contract, once again everything seems to be going well.

Once again, you are rather cautious and as you do things right, you start by sending 0.01 ETH on the contract. A quick glance shows you that your Ether fragments are there and you decide to put a little more to test this bot in real conditions.

[Overview of transactions after depositing ETH on the contract](https://preview.redd.it/98o33s6tkdja1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9807e3436029dc2f20403d280702b1df3f1c3160)

Everything is going well, the blockchain confirms your deposits and that they went well. Now, there is only one thing left to do: launch the solidity bot.

The big moment has arrived, and despite some doubts, you give in to temptation and click on the Start button which is holding out its arms to you. A new MetaMask transaction is displayed to give your approval, which you check once again, so that you have a clear conscience and don't miss anything.

After a look at the blockchain contract, the bot seems to be on its way, but one thing catches your sharp eye. Curiously, the balance of the contract is now at 0.

A few hours pass and finally the contract balance is still at 0. Since this doesn't work, it's time to get your ETH back. One click on the withdrawal button and a new MetaMask transaction appears. Again, you take all the necessary precautions before signing the transaction.

A few moments later, the transaction is finally validated. Unfortunately, you don't get your money back and you have been scammed and will never see your ETH again.

# But what happened?

First of all, it is very likely that the video you have just seen has been slightly modified.

Secondly, you have probably used a version of Remix that is compromised. Indeed, here are various addresses with alternative versions of Remix whose aim is to scam you:

>remixethereumcompiler.net/  
>  
>remixethereumcompiler.github.io/  
>  
>remixethereum-ide.github.io/  
>  
>remix-eth.github.io/

&#x200B;

To save you searching, **the official Remix address** is: [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

Even if the interfaces look similar and everything works perfectly, it is perfectly possible to hijack the source code you submitted. For example, by simply changing the removal address that should be yours to that of a hacker. This type of manipulation is done with a simple line of code in JavaScript.

&#x200B;

Finally, the code uses complex functions that use the *mempool* with bytes as well as numbers that are incomprehensible to a novice (or to most people actually).

These complex functions will simply generate the address of the hacker or a new function that will step into the process to make a withdrawal :

[Generating an address using functions](https://preview.redd.it/8ib56z89mdja1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dca9d5d4c06d4f3ff22c855d59a45181e86cea13)

&#x200B;

As you can see, using source code that you do not master can cause great damage. You should not trust the names of variables, functions and even comments. It is easy to misuse code by making it look like it does one thing when in fact it does another.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

Never run any code that you don’t fully understand or trust. It only takes one line of code to convert a seemingly innocent contract into a malicious one.

The golden rule of scamming applies here: *if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.* Be wary of any trading strategies or techniques that promise outsized returns, and don't execute any code unless you know exactly what you're doing. Your wallet will thank you.

275,The Psychology Behind HODLing,117dchu,"Fellow crypto enthusiasts, let's talk about the elephant in the room: the bear market. 2022 has been a tough year, and we're all feeling it. But what's even tougher than watching our portfolios drop is the psychological struggle of HODLing.

We're holding onto our crypto assets for dear life, even as the market plummets. It takes serious diamond hands to resist the urge to sell, but it's not just about being a tough guy (or gal). There's a whole lot of psychology at play here.

First of all, there's the sunk cost fallacy. We've invested so much time, money, and emotional energy into our crypto portfolios that it's hard to let go, even when things are looking grim. We're determined to see our investments through, no matter what.

Then there's loss aversion. We're hardwired to avoid losses, even more than we're driven to seek gains. So when we see our portfolio values dropping, our brains go into panic mode, and we become even more determined to hold on, in the hopes of recouping our losses.

And finally, there's the FOMO factor. We don't want to miss out on potential future gains, so we hold on, even when it seems like the smart move would be to cut our losses and run.

But hey, HODLing isn't all bad. In fact, there's a certain sense of community and camaraderie that comes with weathering a bear market together. We're all in this together, and we can commiserate, share strategies, and offer each other support. That's right /r/CryptoCurrency!

So keep on HODLing, my friends. We may be in the midst of a tough market, but we're tough too. And who knows? Maybe we'll look back on this time as a character-building experience that made us stronger, wiser, and richer in the long run. Or maybe we'll just be broke. Either way, we'll have each other. ❤️",Weaver96,37,8,0.65
276,Hong Kong Could Force the SEC to Stop its Crypto Attack,117daik,"Over the last couple of years, China has slowly been clamping down on Hong Kong more and more and trying to integrate it into the mainland. Overall the results have not been to the extent that the mainland Chinese government has wanted Hong Kong has definitely lost a lot of its Western views that made it such a great bridge between the East and West. The result of this has been crypto startups and other tech companies having to either choose between the two sides or try and move to a third country like Singapore which has grown in importance as serving as the bridge that Kong Kong used to have an exclusive hold on.

&#x200B;

The US and by the US I mean the SEC has been cracking down like a crazy person on crypto companies across the board Hong Kong, with the mainland approval, has started to look at allowing retail investors to be able to trade in some large-cap tokens. If this happens to go through this would be huge for the crypto space and not because it would represent a shift in possible Chinese thinking but because of the reaction it will trigger in the US. 

&#x200B;

Since the start of this new Congress Republicans in the House have made it clear that they are worried about China and it overtaking the US in cutting-edge science and technology. Not only that but really anywhere in the economy that China could try and create the rules Congress is worried about and wants to do everything it can along with other Western powers to make sure that does not happen. This is why China's decision is so key and vital as Congress will act much quicker if they feel they could lose an economic edge. Meaning they could easily tell the SEC to back off and calm down or threaten to pass legislation that would remove powers that the SEC is currently utilizing in this insane wheeling and dealing crackdown. 

&#x200B;

Reigning in the SEC and actually getting some sort of guidance from Congress would be key for the industry. We have seen with FTX that if you do not provide guidance and instead throw together a bunch of random laws/ideas the result is going to be chaos and companies not being based in the US and instead going to other countries like the Bahamas, Singapore, etc. which is the worst thing for US consumers. Congress will not want to have to deal with company flight or people having to deal with additional financial fallout as that issue is currently bad enough as it is. More of it is not something that either side wants and would be extremely complicated in trying to explain to citizens, especially with the FTX fallout showing more and more how Congress completely allowed this to happen and turned a blind eye way too many times.",Status_Floor1746,17,7,0.67

Although it appears that the FED itself wouldn't ban privately issued stable coins according to Jerome Powell - although an old interview so things might have changed.

>During Jerome Powell’s Jan. 11 United States Senate confirmation hearings, Sen. Patrick Toomey posed a question to the incumbent-and-future Federal Reserve chief: “If Congress were to authorize and the Fed were to pursue a central bank digital dollar, is there anything about that that ought to preclude a well-regulated privately-issued stablecoin from co-existing with a central bank digital dollar?”

Would anybody still use the privately issued stable coins when they could just get a fully backed digital dollar from the US itself?

I'm not sure what the regulations would be for anybody outside the US trying to get a US digital dollar since it appears that currently the only way to get the Chinese Digital Yuan is to have a Chinese bank account. So perhaps the same type of regulations would be issued for the US digital dollar, pushing privately issued digital dollars to be used more by people outside the US than those who can get the digital dollar inside the US.

278,Five former Safemoon maxis reveal their stories [serious],117cy9u,"As time drags on in Safemoon land with a dearth of useful products, information and explanations of various suspicious and outright fraudulent blockchain activities, I have occasionally received messages of apology from former members of the Safemoon cult who have seen the light. Sometimes I ask them what made them change their minds and personally I find their stories fascinating, so I'm sharing them here for you.  

###1. The former Discord moderator

>Me? Nothing much, just a holder who got in late March from a friend who made 5 figures off a small investment early on. I'm new to crypto in general but have learnt a lot through the trial by fire that is Safemoon. Believed a lot of the bullshit before one day you realise there's too many red flags to keep protecting it. 

>Followed the hype and made a lot of friends in the discord, so was suggested to apply and help moderate earlier in 2022. When you're in the OPs channel and you read the way John communicates with mods and staff belittling them and writing off valid criticism as FUD, you realise how immature and incapable of running a ""company"" he is. My concerns grew seeing the Bitmart LP hack happen and there being no explanation except misappropriating the LP. 

>The forming of Safemoon as a company just to avoid the SEC knocking on the doors (not that it matters there's probably nobody in the offices now). Seeing Mr Adult / Fox gaslighting everyone and inflating his ego while the twitter account and marketing continue to be misleading to holders. 

>The more I look the more I see signs of Safemoon just dragging out product releases to look like they are a legitimate business and I hope it catches up to him. 

###2. The former Reddit Maxi

> For me, safemoon was my first crypto. I was working at a school board at that time and was completely burnout and hating my life, it gave me hope that I could exit the job and become financially free, and bought into the misinformation and blatant false project potential. I understand and sympathize with people that are still maxis as they are trying to protect their declining investment, regardless of the signs.
>As more people left the ""company"" and continual articles and videos were released about the fraud and money stolen from the LP I started to wake up.  The fact that John never came out and made a statement raised my suspicions and then i finally dug deeper, it was obvious the whole time. I feel like an idiot haha, all good though lesson learned.  

###3. The former Content Creator  

> Safemoon had a massive community to market and push any product, they had millions although I wasn't sure where they got them, and the releasing of blockchain and exchange with a huge community to bring attention and users to it, could have caused it to be widely used if it wasn't a terrible product and thus cause a price run. The opportunities with operation phoenix and dark moon (his mom) were actually just as big as we had thought. But over time with delays, lies, team leaving, finding out almost everyone took from the cookie jar, the team and John Karony demonstrated they were taking care of themselves first then winging the products for Safemoon. 

> Then comes Coffeezilla's information and accusations along with lawsuits that make John look worse than any previous member of the team, info we didn't have until recently. All of which appears to me like the easiest crypto win in the world was wasted by a centralization in what is supposed to be a decentralized space. Most people probably couldn't handle being exposed to that kind of money and fame, but John Karony might have been the worst person to possibly run Safemoon. With an honest intelligent person Safemoon could have been a huge name but the opportunity was wasted and recovery seems near impossible

### 4. The former Twitter Space host  

> For me, the ""walk away moment"" was two fold:  

> When Grove listed, it had become obvious to me that they were all just copies of the same playbook. When they allowed Falasi to dump on the army and provided no legit explanation, I finally realized that it was all a scam to profit off swap partner listing fees.  That is THE model.  So, when Don announced that he was going to launch BBTF, I remember tweeting, ""Just what we need, another project to pull money from Safemoon.""

> The second thing was hearing how internal people had discussions with John regarding making the people whole who lost money in the V1 honeypot. The way he described him as wanting nothing to do with making those people whole. It made me sick. I could tell he wasn't lying. Today, the army acts like the most recent reimbursement makes up for the massive losses those people incurred over the past year. That is so disingenuous and exactly why I don't feel bad for going after the project. I only care that new investors don't get screwed.

>I initially thought SafeMoon was a smart move and it was literally EVERYWHERE when I jumped in (week 1). Quickly made an absolute fortune and believed it could be even bigger for one reason: John Karony and the team were quite happy to self-dox -AND- appear in those weekly videos. To me, that meant either they were stupid or they have massive fucking balls to become public figures whilst running a long scam. 

>When did I realise it was a scam? Partly after reading your fine work and also because I was a Mod and quickly started to see that a lot of what the team were promising was basically ... bollocks.

279,Quantum computing and crypto developments,117csq8,"Did you know that some cryptocurrencies are designed to be resistant to quantum computing attacks? I sure as hell didn't. Here's what I found:

Quantum computing is a technology that has the potential to break the cryptography used to secure most of today's digital communications, including cryptocurrencies. This is because quantum computers can solve complex mathematical problems much faster than traditional computers, which could be used to undermine the security of most cryptographic systems in use today.

To address this potential vulnerability, some cryptocurrencies, such as QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger), are designed to use post-quantum cryptography. This type of cryptography is resistant to quantum computing attacks and is designed to keep the underlying blockchain secure even in the face of this new technology. (This is not a shill. I just found it online. So don't buy it. Nfa.)

In addition to post-quantum cryptography, there are other techniques being developed to make cryptocurrencies more resistant to quantum computing attacks, such as lattice-based cryptography and hash-based digital signatures. These techniques are still being developed and refined, but they offer a promising path forward for ensuring the long-term security of cryptocurrencies in the face of emerging technologies like quantum computing.


*What about Bitcoin then?*

Bitcoin currently uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm as part of its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. However, SHA-256 is not considered to be quantum computing resistant, and it is vulnerable to attacks by a sufficiently large quantum computer.

While it is technically possible to change the underlying cryptographic algorithms used by Bitcoin, it would require a hard fork of the Bitcoin network, which is a major undertaking that would require the consensus of the entire Bitcoin community. In addition, changing the cryptographic algorithms could have unintended consequences for the security and performance of the Bitcoin network.

However, there are other solutions being proposed to make Bitcoin more quantum-resistant without changing its underlying cryptographic algorithms. One such solution is the use of quantum-resistant signature schemes, which would replace the current digital signature scheme used by Bitcoin. Another solution is the use of layer-2 protocols, such as the Lightning Network, which would enable faster and more efficient transactions while also providing additional security against quantum attacks.

Overall, while it may be challenging to make Bitcoin completely quantum computing proof, there are steps being taken to ensure that the network remains secure and resilient in the face of emerging technologies like quantum computing.",axolotl_life,32,10,0.69
280,Lessons learned & looking back at 2018 portfolio,117bdoc," 

I liked the idea of looking back at my first short adventure with crypto in 2017/2018. What would have happened if I hadn't sold anything back then? What lessons can I learn from this?

In late 2017, some of my colleagues were busy talking about bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I was interested in this and wanted to start investing a small part in crypto myself.

I have to be honest that at that time I didn't really know what I was doing, I bought some coins in that last month of 2017 that I heard a lot of people talking about because I thought this was a good investment towards the future. At the beginning of 2018 BTC started to ""crash"" again and on 14/01/2018 I sold everything

Value and composition (in dollars) of portfolio:  
(BTC & LTC because I saw that as the default at the time)  
(NEO & BAT because colleagues had 'tipped' this at the time)  
(XVG & TRON were really hot at the time)  
(Chainlink via an obscure post on reddit took a gamble on it)

Next chart shows the same portfolio should I have kept everything and sold at their peak since 14/01/2018. And additionally should I have kept everything up to today and sold now.

Last is the total sum I got 2018, the total sum should I have sold everything at its peak in 2021 and last what it would be worth today.

BTC: Known of course, got a lot wrong in 2021, but remains the default.LTC: Still has value, but portfolio is now worth less than half of what it was in 2018NEO: Sold quasi at its peak, is now still worth a fraction of what it was worth then.TRON: In the end over all the years still proved quite 'stable', has kept its value quite wellVERGE: Became completely worthless, worth only a fraction of what it once was. Pure hype coin.BAT: Still worth half of 2018, still has value through Brave.Chainlink: Was the least known to me at the time, but was eventually going to be the big winner. Still a great value today, but had I sold it at its peak it would have turned out to be the big winner.

**What did I learn from this myself:**

\- BTC remains the standard and the most reliable currency. (captain obvious)

\- It seems to be easy to just buy crypto and keep up with it, but for myself it has still turned out that many projects cannot live up to it and a new ATH is not guaranteed.

\- Sometimes you have enough with 1 winner, had I just kept chainlink until 2021 I would have made a nice sum.

Guess the moral of the story is that you can't be sure of anything and should still follow your chosen projects closely. Also be sure to take profits when you can.

In itself pretty obvious lessons, but thought it was a nice exercise for myself to look back at that crypto adventure of 2 months :)",imbarrydylan,20,7,0.83

**Alot of us often feel like we don't invest enough in Crypto to really make a difference in our life, me included.**

The usual case for normal folks like us who are working a typical 9-5 job at the fiat mines making just enough to maintain ourselves and have a bit of money to spare to invest in Crypto or Stocks. 

**Ofcourse everybody has it differently, for some $100 Dollars is alot, and for others $10,000 is their annual savings.**

This sub is home to so many different people all around the world, plenty of times we don't think about the situation of other people here.

Not everybody is blessed with being born in a well developed country or with great parents and a beneficial enviroment.

The most of us have to work hard for the money we earn and can't be reckless, so when investing in Crypto, the less fortunate have it way harder than the others.

**For example:**

A less fortunate person invests $100 Dollars (buys him groceries for a week) that he can spare and sees it going towards $200 Dollars, for him it might not seem worth to sell for merely another week worth of groceries.

*Unfortunately he didn't take profits because he was hoping it goes to $500 Dollars to make it worth his while.*

Meanwhile a more fortunate person invests $10,000 Dollars (his spare money for the month) and sees his Crypto going towards $15,000 Dollars and he decides to sell everything, making an impressive profit.

Psychologically, it's harder to settle for $100 dollars in profit as a poorer person compared to a wealthy person who has relatively less invested.

Even though the less fortunate person wasn't satisfied with his profits, he needs to stay realistic and take profits whenever he can and be patient.

*Rome wasn't built in a day but it burned in one...*

TLDR: You need alot of patience in this market when you are less fortunate, either way, absolutely nobody should spend more than they can afford, this goes for the fortunate people and less fortunate people.

285,"I've been in crypto for nearly 10 years, and trading in this treacherous market for over 6 years. Here are some reality checks I learned and could help you:",11796gy,"# INTRO

This is a fickle volatile market.

I like to think of it as a Bogdanov market, that seems to troll you at every turn. When you think you have this market figured out, it does something unexpected and irrational. These coins are the devil's coin.

There's a good reason for this, it's money, it's supply and demand, it's speculation, and it's capitalism. And people in this market are driven by their emotions more than anything else.

But crypto has amplified that with its much more speculative and volatile market.

Sure, those coins have useful tech behind them, and growing utility in this world. But right now, the market doesn't follow tech innovation so much, this market still mostly runs on speculation.  And it runs partly on tokenomics (including the famous 4 year cycles), which are a little different from your traditional markets.

This roller coaster market is a place for very level headed people, who have a good sense of observation, can make clinical strategies, and don't let their emotions decide for them.

&#x200B;

# Most people here aren't going to make life changing money.

Sorry to start off with some bad news.

But how many of the people who even made some big bucks in 2021, or had big gains on that Doge coin rally, are sitting here today in their big house that Doge bought, or got enough money that they don't have to work anymore?

Unless you are already wealthy, have a long term plan involving decades, or have big sums you can invest, and already started buying the bear market we had last year, then by ""most people"", it might include you.

Making it big for most people will require very big risks, or a very long time.

If you're here looking for life changing money, you are probably looking at turning a big chunk of the little money you have into something like over 10x returns. Maybe even a lot more.

And that's where trouble starts.

The bigger the return you are after, and the shorter the time, the more likely you are to get burned hard. So odds are, there's a better chance you either get burned, or only make non-life changing money. Even if many coins do more than 10x.

&#x200B;

# What about all those coins that keep going 10x sometimes 100x, what about all the people who made a lot of money?

It's a probability game. And also requires incredible crystal ball timing. Sure, a minority will get lucky, and turn small sums into life changing money.

""but...crypto had huge gains in the last bull markets, the tech is still bullish, adoption is still growing, and even if we have half those gains in the next bull run, it will still be massive gains""

That's correct.

But even if you had somehow managed to buy before the beginning of the last bull market (and that's a big if), would you have invested enough? Would you have not panic sold after one of the many dips? Not panic sold at one of the many FUD news? Would you have held on long enough? Would you have have pulled out in time before the crash? Would you have avoided the scams? Avoided the rugpulls? Avoided the bad exchanges? Avoided the wrong coins? Had only money in the top gainers?

Probably not.

You would have needed a crystal ball to get that life changing money.

&#x200B;

# Looking at more measured risk and realistic goals.

Forget 100x, or even 10x, life changing money, goals of a house, goals of retiring before 40.

That's the wrong mindset.

All the people who made it big in investments like Buffet, have the same thing in common. They weren't dreamers, they were opportunistic.

They kept their eyes open for value and opportunity.

The people who are gonna make it, are people who are willing to accept what's actually there, are able to adapt, are willing to sometimes accept smaller goals, more realistic returns, measure their risk, spread their eggs, not go all in or all out, not rely too much on timing the market, have more patience etc...

But at the same time, they'll probably have a decent amount of funds to begin with.

Unfortunately, you need money to make money. Even Buffet didn't start from nothing as he'd have people believe. He started with a lot of money.

And most importantly, not invest based on expectation, but based on strategy. With an ability to adapt to circumstances, and not be trapped with hopes of big returns, and goals of returns to buy a house etc... They take what they can based on the circumstances, and based on a laid out plan.

&#x200B;

# Even if you make life changing money, keeping it is no picnic.

Where are those Youtubers from 2017 who were showing off their Lambos? Like most people who are new to making money, they had no idea how to manage it and hold on to it. It got spent, badly re-gambled, and mostly gone by now.

How many celebrities, big athletes, lottery winners, made it big, but lost a big chunk of their money years later?

Even rich people with some experience with money, often mismanage their money, and end up losing big.

Even if you get enough money to have ""life changing money"", it may not last long enough to really change your life for that long.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion.

Bummed out? Don't be. If you know the reality of what you're getting into, you'll make smarter choices, and end up ahead of most people.

You'll have more measured expectations, and fewer regrets. And actually end up with more money in the end.

You might even avoid ending up like the FTX, LUNA, SOL, Voyager people who went all in.

Or you might avoid being like the people in last year's bear market who got back to square one, lost too much money, bankrupted themselves, had their dreams crushed, raged quit crypto etc...",fan_of_hakiksexydays,279,459,0.89
286,Let’s talk about regulations,1178oqz,"With all this talk about stable coins not meeting regulatory standards, does anybody else see bad luck on the horizon for USDT?

With allegations of billions in USDT being printed with no backing over the past 5 or so years, it’s possible there are a lot of non-real dollars *still* propping the crypto industry up. Fwiw, I’m not suggesting this is the whole reason prices have run since 2017, but I think it’s part of it. 

Considering the eventual effects of looming US regulation on crypto as a whole, and stablecoins specifically to make way for CBDCs, does anyone have concern about buying at the moment? 

With how much USDT was supposedly printed to provide liquidity for Alameda before it collapsed, some of us expected to see some fallout effects for Tether, but surprisingly, it came out unscathed. 

Many consider USDT to be something of a ticking time bomb and a matter of when, not if. With regulations on the way, it could mean bad news for Tether; a healthier industry in the long-term, but bad news for prices in the short-term.

294,The 3 legitimate criticisms about Bitcoin you can make,117777h,"The more the success of the Bitcoin revolution appears inevitable to the powerful people at the head of the current monetary and financial system, the more you can see that they start to denigrate Bitcoin falsely.

One day, these powerful people tell you that Bitcoin is a Ponzi Scheme. Another day, these powerful people tell you that Bitcoin is an environmental disaster. Another day, these powerful people tell you that Bitcoin is dangerous and used only for illegal activities.

Of course, all of this is false, and governments continue to tax you on your Bitcoin gains. Isn't it amazing to tax people on something that is dangerous and that everyone should avoid?

This is yet another proof of the hypocrisy of the powerful in the current system who are now trying to make people believe that their CBDCs will solve the people's problem and make Bitcoin obsolete. Yet another lie, but the general public still seems to have a hard time getting past the narrative of the powerful people at the head of the current system.

For those who want to criticize Bitcoin, it seems to me that there are currently at least 3 legitimate criticisms that can be made. Of course, you will never hear the powerful people at the head of the current system make them because that would require studying the Bitcoin system for real instead of just propagating lies.

Here are these 3 legitimate criticisms of Bitcoin:

**1. Bitcoin does not consume enough energy**

Bitcoin is energy. Bitcoin units cannot be produced out of thin air like fiat currencies. This is something essential. What is interesting here is that the energy consumed by the Bitcoin network will help fight climate change.

Bitcoin will help the energy transition by giving a real incentive to develop renewable energy.

BTC mining, thanks to its geographic agnosticism, can be installed on oil sites and consume methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Besides, the Bitcoin network offers a floor price to energy companies that need money to finance the energy transition.

**2. Bitcoin does not have enough nodes on its network**

Nodes are the gatekeepers of the Bitcoin protocol rules. The more nodes on the network, the better.

**3. Most BTC units are purchased in KYC mode, and this is something that needs to be changed**

The purpose of Bitcoin is to allow you to protect the fruits of your labor within a decentralized network without having to reveal your identity.

Some people forget this, but buying Bitcoin in no-KYC mode is the right way to do it.

The more information you give about your identity to centralized exchange platforms that enforce government KYC policies, the more you put yourself at risk when those platforms are eventually hacked. It always happens sooner or later.

Buying Bitcoin in no-KYC mode really protects you from all kinds of censorship and potential threats.",sylsau,25,1,0.5

What I am proposing are periods of socially encouraged use limits on Etheruem's layer 1s. Perhaps during this time we encourage people to only do wallet to wallet transfers and transfering or bridging to layer 2s. So we encourage people and projects to not mint nfts, initiate smart contracts and even limit use defi smart contracts such as uniswap. 

I get that socially encouraging people won't stop all of those forms activity but perhaps social pressure can limit things like big NFT drops for long enough for people to move small amounts of Eth or other token around. Perhaps we could give ourselves 30 minutes a week. This would also help people transition to layer 2s as they would have a window where they can get there eth from layer 1 to layer 2. 

Note: I am in no way advocating for this to be enforced through any means. More of like an Earth hour type of thing, we encourage people to turn the lights off momentarily. 

Note 2: I am so ready to get smashed by Etheruem critics, this is a weird work around to scalability issues I agree.",Cadellaoc,16,0,0.36
296,I’m going to miss the bear market.,1176pq8,"Not saying we are totally out of it yet, but I’m going to miss the quiet building of the bear market.

Most of the toxic noise has left the space at least from the frenzied pitch it was at the height of the last bull cycle.  I’m finding I deeply enjoy the atmosphere in this space during the winters.  No hype, just building for the most part.  

Weak projects that never had any business even existing get rekted.  Memecoins are shouted down by the majority.  I’m just going to miss this season of fundamentals mattering.

In time the bull market will reemerge.  Fundamentals will get thrown out the window in exchange for rampant speculation and another catastrophic bubble will form in the industry.

The latest versions of Do Kwon and Terra Luna will emerge with faulty structures propped up by hype only to collapse when the next winter comes to stress test them.

And we will do it all over again.  The whole show will get repeated all over again.  I am hopeful for one day a “super-cycle” to emerge and we break the mold, but honestly right now I think we get two more cycles before getting there.

Hopefully I’m wrong, but I’ve learned to not underestimate human greed that forms bubbles.

Edit: I guess a lot of people didn’t read the opening line where I said I don’t think we are out of the bear market yet.  These bears seem to be as zealous as the bulls.

But does a sideways year really count as still being a bear market?  Probably don’t start a significant rally till the halving. Probably be a year for accumulation.  But I guess I was saying I will miss the quietness of the winter.  The hype has left and it’s just the true believers left mostly.

I got into crypto around 2016-ish, but at that time I didn't really have any money to invest - I was a student then, so I had a lot of time to do research, but no money to spend on the projects I liked. Now I have a job and the ability to save a little every month. But now I also have a family and other responsibilities, so I no longer have as much time to do research.

Frankly, I'd like to find a service where I can pay someone to do the investing for me. I have found a few copy trading services, but they seem to be focused on daytrading, futures and leverage trading. What I would like is to be able to DCA every month over several years into a spot portfolio which has a healthy amount of BTC and ETH, but which also ventures into promising new projects with some of the capital. I know that simply hodling ETH and BTC is the preferred strategy for a lot of redditors, but the simple fact is that I would like a little more risk for the potential of a little more reward - I consider all the money I put into crypto as lost, and will not cash out until I reach a pre-determined goal of what would be life-changing money for me. I don't think it's realistic to reach that goal with BTC and ETH alone, so gambling it is :D

Also, since I suck at taking profits, I'd like the service to do that regularly for me, as well as reinvesting it when appropriate. I'm not looking for a bot that daytrades with my money, but someone with more knowledge than me who can pay a little more attention to the markets than I am able to at the moment.

301,The new investor dilemma,1174itz,"     Aside from not knowing much about how things work (Well neither do most veteran traders), new investors are a MAJOR part of what drives the prices up in most stocks, and are the exit liquidity of all bag holders who are in it to profit. Even those that are in it for the tech will eventually sell in their pre-determined ""5 to 10 year holding"".

     Will mass adoption and awareness on how to invest properly and smartly be the last major volatile bull run that crypto will have? This will ultimately throw the huge volatility (Relatively to the stock market) out of the window. After that point is eventually reached, then blue chip coins will thrive based on the technological innovations and ease of use to the people.

     Or should we keep relying on new ignorant investors to pump the prices up and unload the bag holder's coins for huge profits. All this is said given that institutional adoption is approaching at its usual current pace.

Maybe many of you do not know The Rock Trading, but it was launched in 2011 by **Andrea Medri** e **Davide Barbieri**  and one of the first exchanges to go live internationally. It became famous for trading Second Life's ""Linden Dollar"".

Some weeks ago it was reported by some users on Telegram groups that there were problems with ""withdrawings"" from the platform

On the 17th February 2022 users received a message via email that informed of the halting of all operations. Website has the same message and users cannot login  in the platform .

It's important to underline that the exchange was registered and regulated in Italy and it was active for 12 years. It was not a semi-unknown website or a scam exchange, but in the past years  (in particular between 2012 and 2018) was used a lot by Italian investors.

5. You've lost more money on crypto than you've made in your job.

6.You have more crypto wallets than actual wallets.

7. You get excited every time Elon Musk tweets about crypto, even though you know you shouldn't.

Every now and again the legitimacy of crypto gets brought up in conversation. 

“We don’t need another currency” 

“it has no tangible value” 

“too many scams” 

are some of the common issues presented by my smooth brain peers. I say things like:

“we used to use sticks with notches, evolution is something to embrace not shy away from” 

“the fact checking nature of crypto could be used in voting, to not only ensure fair vote counting but to potentially pay voters for their involvement” 

“name something or anything that there aren’t scams for…”

These don’t entirely convince people but hopefully I’m getting them thinking that it may not all be a pile of crap.

307,I think we need to have a better term for given types of coins,1170ero,"So I'm sure we all heard lately of the ton of ""AI"" coins that came out or already out. Some of the coins have use, while others are just going off the ChatGPT hype. And I imagine as AI comes more and more out, this will come in waves.

So calling it the latest ""hype coin"" or ""shit coin"" isn't accurate. As I mention, some of the coins actually do have some use. And some of  them are even a few years old, so it isn't like they jumped on the current trend train. So it isn't like they are jumping into the current trend just to grab investors. And because some of them have actual use, they aren't shit coins too. 

&#x200B;

There is no good label for these types of coins. Where they just so happened to be in a trendy area, it is functional, and whatever trending has no real influence if the coin is in the trending thing.  What terminology do you think best fits thing like this?

(Note: in the stock world something like this would be called a unicorn. But that tends to be a extremely small set of companies, if not just 1. I feel as time goes by, we will see more and more of this happen. Like as web 3 comes out, I can see where coins dealing with that will be this. When CBDC come out then another set of coins will magically fall within the trendy thing. And so on. So a unicorn doesn't fit this IMO.)",crua9,39,4,0.69
308,"What’s been your interest or motive for being in crypto, during the bear?",116zaxn,"What has kept you steady and occupied in Crypto, during this bear market? Also, what chain has kept you the most occupied? 

Some potential options could be:

- On-chain Governance participation 
- Staking
- Yield Farming 
- P2E gaming
- Simple Stacking (DCA strategy, stacking Sats or other crypto)
- NFTs (trading, collecting, potential utility of a certain NFT)
- degen activities (leveraged plays, doggy token trading, riding hype trains to $0)
- technology (you enjoy the technology, and are having fun watching as the space evolves)
- Development, as in, you are a developer and are currently building
- you’re a node operator, miner or validator

I feel like his covers a lot of ground, but if you have something to add, please comment. I’m really curious to hear from the ones who have stuck around.

Me, I have been very active in on-chain governance and enjoy Governance drama, it’s very entertaining. For those of you who are involved in Cosmos Governance, you know there is no shortage of drama in Cosmos Hub governance. I find it worth it though. Cosmos and the Cosmos IBC ecosystem have some cool things being built and good features and software updates needing voted on.

I have also been finding new projects to stake tokens to earn some tokens passively. I’m newly staking my DOT, AVAX and am going to branch out to stake some other tokens like ADA as well. Would love to find some others to add to the list, so I’m open to suggestions. I’m heavily involved in staking in the Cosmos ecosystem, ATOM and OSMO are my biggest positions, but I have multiple others staked that I have gotten some smaller positions in or had airdropped and just staked rather than selling. 

The main thing that takes my time now a days is trying to understand the different architectures between blockchains like Avalanche, Polkadot, Cardano, Solana, Hedera, Algorand, ICP and a few more. It’s a lot to take in, and requires a ton of repeated information, since I’d say I’m a pretty slow learner, but I’m persistent and it’s kept me entertained and investing throughout the bear market.

309,The Next Big Potential Vaporware Project Was Acquired By Coinbase?,116xw44,"I was sifting through some low marketcap projects, searching for a golden needle in a haystack, when I got discouraged by the vast amounts of memecoins, pump-and-dumps, and other useless tokens. Then I remembered Coinbase Ventures, a transparent subsection of Coinbase where you can find ""exceptional founders who share Coinbase’s mission of creating more economic freedom for the world.""   


*Surely, an entity funded by the likes of COINBASE would be reputable and chalked full of potential*, I thought to myself as I began scouring the projects for the most appealing logos. Then I saw the ""acquired"" sticker. I'm assuming that these are projects that Coinbase, a publicly traded company, has gone all-in on because of the recognition of their potential. Jackpot! These low-cap gems would probably be the future of DeFi. I was looking for some cutting-edge innovation that would completely change the course of crypto--a definitive use for the technology with no purpose.   


These were my expectations when I stumbled upon ""Altered State Machine."" This outlandishly ridiculous project (1 of 22 of Coinbase's acquisitions, mind you) is touting the development of ""**Non-Fungible Intelligence**""  that can be used to automate **P2E gaming** to generate **passive income**, create **chatbots**, and mint **virtual metaverse assistants**. With the ASTO token, holders can **stake for rewards**, **train AI**, upgrade their characters with **collectibles**, and more.  You can purchase ""brains"" that function as **AI Agents** and separately spend even more money on an **NFT** for said ""brain"" (Patent-pending).   


There were so many **buzzwords**, my teeth were chattering inside of my skull. Who's believing this shit? If something sounds too good to be true... If I had to say one nice thing about the project, gun to my head: They hired some really\* talented artists to give it appeal. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but I can't believe that Coinbase would acquire something that's, quite simply, the epitome of a vaporware scam. Maybe I'm punching above my weight class here by assuming that I'm more privy to scam detection than a multi-billion dollar platform. What do you think? I could be eating my words in a few years. Either way, I'm done DYORing for the night.

310,Who else doesn't belong here,116x14x,"I'm a 27 year old who had spent thousands on crypto, and I don't really know what most of it does.

In early 2021, I was working with this teenager (I own my own small painting company he was a laborer in another trade) who had bought tons of doge the year before. He started going nuts at lunch because his Doge went to 6 cents, and he had made THOUSANDS of dollars. 

I had heard of Bitcoin and Doge and whatnot, but I was never risky and didn't trust it. Well, that all changed really quickly when he told me it would probably go to a dollar and the FOMO set in. This teenager had like 10k just sitting in his account because of some stupid coin? Of course I wanted in.

 I bought a little DOGE on Robinhood and doubled my investment IMMEDIATELY. Then the flood gates opened,  I bought a ton of DOGE and paper handed that bitch like 50 times losing and gaining money every other day. I eventually sold near the top and made a decent amount.

I got on Reddit to look for advice and other opportunities during the bull-run (Absolutely Genius Right?) because it seemed it was a crypto friendly community with lots of information. So I got pulled into all these different coins but made sure I ""did my own research"" even though I don't know what half of the shit on the white papers mean. 

I ended up buying BTC, ETH, AMP, MATIC, SHIB, and a few other coins. But the one I was hyped about was LRC. I ended up buying a ton with all the GME hype and got left with a decent but not terrible bag. Still holding to this day.

I've been in this community for over 2 years and I have thousands invested in things I knew little about because some teenager made some cash overnight. I am still learning and it seems most of my investments are good ones (I sold SHIB high and made a bit) but I still feel like I know nothing about crypto and just FOMOed my way into most of it. I have a few moons, but I don't even know what they do or how I originally got them? Now I'm making myself learn more, I'm just dumb cuz it hurts my head. Anyone else lose their wits when people around them were making money? And what did you invest in? 


TLDR: I FOMOed into crypto because of DOGE hype, without knowing anything and am now forcing myself to learn more because I have thousands invested in things I know little about because i was addicted. Did anyone else find crypto this way or are you all just smart people?

PS: I'm friends with that guy now and he never sold any DOGE because he thought it would reach a dollar. He told me he could have had almost 130k at the top and now he's almost back where he started that day at lunch. Wild

317,Good news to people with WLUNA - i just converted it to ETH. Here is the guide.,116pqob,"I have like many people tried to convert WLUNA to something else, but with no luck until now.

I just successful sent my WLUNA from Coinbase to MetaMask and swapping it for ETH.

Here’s how:

1. Create a MetaMask wallet (ethereum main net if it asks you) 
2. Open Coinbase wallet
3. Send WLUNA to your MetaMask address
4. Waited 15 min and a notification appeared on MetaMask saying i had tokens waiting.
5. Clicked the notification and approved the transfer of Wrapped LUNA token (I think it said LUNA-S)
6. scrolled down on my front page in MetaMask and clicked on LUNA token
7. click swap
8. picked ETH to swap to. Click review swap

10. done. Transfer ETH to an exchange if you’d like",MyWayToTheTop,52,8,0.84
318,Rich vs Poor: Taking Profits in Crypto,116p4q9,"Many of us recognize that being rich makes it easier to make money from investments.  An underrated aspect about being rich is that it makes it **easier to take profits from investments** as well and especially in a casino like the crypto market.  Here is an example.

Rich has 5 million dollars net worth, and invests 1% of his net worth into crypto during the bear market.  That is 50,000 dollars.  In the bull market, Rich sees 10x growth in his portfolio and it balloons up to 500,000 dollars.  For Rich, 500,000 dollars is still a large money and Rich takes profit on 80-90% of it.

Poor has 10,000 dollars net worth, and invests 1% of his net worth into crypto during the bear market.  That is 100 dollars.  In the bull market, poor sees 10x growth in his portfolio and it balloons up to 1000 dollars.  For Poor, 1000 dollars just isn't satisfying as Poor wants to stop being poor so Poor doesn't take any profit.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Bear market hits and crypto dumps down the drain.  Rich took 400,000 dollars in profit and is happy about his situation while Poor is even or down again.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Basically, the problem for poor is that the initial investment is so small that it is impossibly difficult to take profits because while the percentage gained is large, the amount gained is unsatisfying and doesn't get himself out of the poor status.  For rich, both the percentage gained and the amount gained is large.  Even for millionaires, half a million dollars is deemed a huge amount of money that you want to preserve.  So you take the profit.  The rich becomes richer and the poor stays poor.

Moral of the story.  Increase your amount in your portfolio and taking profits will be easier.  (this means less gambling and more on doing whatever it takes to increase your seed by taking on multiple jobs, working overtime, etc. )",simmol,140,29,0.65
319,Shxtcoins with “taxes” explained,116mmed,"This is a follow up to the Shxtcoin scam of the week posted earlier. I figured some people might not know how these “taxed” coins work. 

Basically, when you buy or sell one of these projects, you need to adjust the slippage usually 5-10% to account for the tax. This means you’re automatically getting 5-10% less than what you originally wanted to buy/sell, and need to take that into account. OR JUST STAY AWAY COMPLETELY. There may be some projects with a valid use case for a tax, but by and large, taxes are largely associated with scams/ponzis. 


What happens with the tax? Here are two common scenarios:

1: Sometimes called “Reflections” - the tax gets distributed back to holders based on the amount of supply they hold (ponzi). This almost always benefits the founders and those who bought early because they were able to buy up high percentages of the supply for cheap. 

2: Tax goes directly to a wallet that only select individuals can access (dev wallet/marketing wallet/treasury/etc). Most of the time I see these dev wallets sit until their coin has no more trading volume, and they just empty the wallet and make a new coin to do it all again. Sometimes you’ll see “Buy Backs”, where the owners will use this wallet to buy some of the project back, artificially pumping the price, and you’ll likely see sells immediately after by those who knew about the buyback “pump” ahead of time. 


TLDR; Taxes are basically just sending 5-10% of every trade to the project owner. You’re paying to keep the scam alive and fund the next con.",blackenedavocado,32,4,0.66

321,"How To Crypto 101: What is leverage, why is it dangerous and why to people use it?",116m64j,"# How To Crypto 101: What is leverage, why is it dangerous and why do people use it?

Edit: sorry for typo in title!

Scroll down to the bottom for a TLDR.

As part of an ongoing series of educational posts  I present to you my newest addition. In this article you will learn about what exactly ‘using leverage’ means and why it can ruin your day, week or life.

I see a lot of newer traders on here posting how they got destroyed using leverage. I don’t think many of these investors realize what they are getting themselves into the first time they try to stay afloat in these dangerous waters. I want to make a quick post about what you are actually doing when you use leverage.

# What is leverage?

Leverage in crypto is a feature some non-US exchanges offer (Binance, Kucoin, Gate, etc) that allows you to borrow capital to trade crypto assets. This feature falls under the moniker ‘perpetual futures’ on these exchanges. Perpetual futures allow a trader use a fixed amount of money to gain a larger amount of exposure to an asset. The amount of exposure you get depends on two things:

· The amount of capital you are willing to put in

· The leverage multiplier you use

# Trading fees and funding rates

There are also trading fees and a funding rate to consider in trading perpetual futures. For the sake of this article I will ignore those as they will distract from the overall concept. I will write an addendum to this article if people request more info on these in the comments.

# Math behind using leverage

Many exchanges offer leverage multipliers up to 100x. This is kind of insane for a number of different reasons that I will go into in the next few sections.

For now, let’s assume that I have $100 and I want to trade $1,000 of ETH.

\[amount of exposure desired\] / \[capital\] = \[leverage multiplier\]

$1,000 / $100 = 10

This means that I will need to use a leverage multiplier of 10x to accomplish my goal. I can choose to take either long or short exposure to ETH in this case. If I choose to take long, I am making a (very risky) bet that ETH will go up. If I choose short, I am making an (also very risky) bet that ETH will go down.

Let’s assume I’m bullish and go long on this trade. Since I have $1,000 of exposure, if ETH goes up 5% I will make $50. Here’s the math behind that:

\[total exposure\] + \[percent price has increased since entry\] = \[total exposure + profits\]

$1,000 + 5% = $1,050

You can also write 5% as a 1 plus a numeric multiplier; in this case it would be 1.05 and the equation would look like this:

$1,000 \* 1.05 = $1,050

If I close my trade at the exact point that ETH is up 5% I will get my original $100 back (minus the aforementioned trading fees and funding interest which are NOT a part of my math here for simplicity) plus the profit on my trade which in this case is $50. This means that my total amount returned will be somewhere around $100+$50, or $150. Sounds too good to be true, right?

There is a catch.

# Why is leverage dangerous?

You’ve just read about a very good scenario for an ETH trader. Our auspicious trader effectively made 50% on their $100. They bet that the price of ETH would rise and they were correct.

What happens if they were not correct? Let’s use the same example trade that we used before.

Let’s assume we again put $100 into a 10x leveraged long ETH trade which gives us $1,000 of exposure. This time, the price of ETH drops 7%. All of a sudden our $1,000 of exposure is only worth $930. We understandably feel we have made the wrong move and decide to close the trade.

That $70 needs to be paid back which means it has to come out of the original $100 we put down as collateral.

\[total original capital\] - \[losses on total exposure\] = \[remaining capital refunded on closure of the trade\]

$100 - $70 = $30

In this scenario we only receive $30 of our original $100 back. We have now lost a whopping 70% of our original capital on this bet even though the price of ETH has only gone down 7%.

Yikes.

# Can I lose more money than I put up as collateral?

One of the questions I see asked frequently is ‘can I lose more capital than I initially put into a leveraged crypto perpetual futures trade?’

\*\*\* Edit to include a great point made by u/AceStyle322 in the comments

The answer is no provided you keep your trade type set to Isolated mode. In Cross mode you can potentially lose up to everything in your margin account. Different exchanges have different verbiage for this so make sure to do some research. You set this before you open your position. It's also a good idea to check it after you have created your trade to make sure it was set up correctly. In Isolated mode your losses will be limited to what you put up as capital for that trade only. Either way, crypto exchanges will not be able to track you down and collect more money from you which is why they liquidate your trades when your capital is gone. Read on to find out about liquidation

\*\*\* End edit

In crypto your leverage multiplier acts as a sort of stop loss. You will never lose more than you put down as collateral in Isolated mode. What happens to prevent this is something called ‘liquidation.’

Getting liquidated occurs when your losses on a perpetual futures trade meet or exceed the capital you put into the trade. Let’s look at another example.

Let’s say we put $100 into a long ETH trade with a multiplier of 20x which will give us $2,000 of exposure to ETH. **I want to point out again that this is extremely risky and I don’t think there is ever a time or place to use this kind of multiplier.**

If ETH goes down 5%, we lose:

\[total exposure\] \* \[percentage of entry price lost\] = \[losses\]

$2,000 \* 5% = $100

Our original capital is $100 and we have lost $100. At this point the exchange will automatically sell the rest of our position and take possession of the remaining $1900.

We owe the $100 we lost which comes out of our original $100 capital which means we are left with $0. We have lost everything we put into this trade and since the exchange has closed our position there is no way we can get that $100 back, even if the price rises after this initial drop.

**Unless we put in more capital we will not recover our initial $100.**

In practice most exchanges will build a little padding into their liquidation price because the liquidation process closes your position at market price. Market price means your your position closes at the best price available on the order book which may or may not be wide enough to cover your losses. The exchanges doesn’t want to lose money so they will liquidate you at a slightly higher price than our math suggests. In the example above we can assume that if ETH loses around 4.8% we will get liquidated.

This about this for a minute. If you use 100x leverage as some exchanges allow, a $100 long ETH bet will get you an insane $10,000 of ETH exposure. If the price of ETH drops 1% you will lose your $100 capital and it will be gone forever.

Here is the math to figure out roughly where you will get liquidated:

100 / \[leverage multiplier\] = \[percentage you can lose before getting liquidated\]

If I use a 6x multiplier the equation looks like this:

100 / 6 = 16.66%

To calculate the actual liquidation price of your trade if you go long the formula looks like this:

\[entry price\] – \[percentage of entry price you can lose before getting liquidated\] = \[liquidation price\]

This means that if I enter into a 6x leveraged long MATIC trade at $1 I will get liquidated when MATIC reaches:

$1 – 16.66% of $1 = \~$0.833

For shorting the equation is the same except you have to add the percentage of your entry price instead of subtracting it:

\[entry price\] **+** \[percentage of entry price you can lose before getting liquidated\] = \[liquidation price\]

If I took a short position on MATIC with 6x leverage and a $1 entry price I would be liquidated when MATIC reached:

$1 + 16.66% of $1 = \~$1.166

# Knowing how dangerous this is why would anyone use leverage?

That’s a great question. People like to gamble. Some very experienced traders use leverage to make educated guesses at what the market will do next. Do these traders get their asses handed to them sometimes? Absolutely.

I’m an experienced trader in crypto and other markets and I do mess with leverage when I am confident about how a market is going to move. The most I have lost using leverage in one day is around $30,000 which is around three times the most I have made in one day using it. I honestly wanted to go off myself that day but I stepped away from my keyboard, went outside, played with my daughter and had a date night with my wife. It took around two months but I eventually recovered.

# TLDR

Smart people make bad choices all the time. No one knows what the news or market sentiment will be. My advice to you is to stay away from leveraged trades. That being said, there is a difference between yoloing a shitcoin at 100x and using 2x on BTC or ETH after a major market move to catch a small correction.

Do your research, don’t use more capital than you can afford to lose and if you are unsure about what you are doing do not use leverage.

\*\*\* Edit - some commenters have rightfully stated that there are strategies you can implement to  use leverage safely. My next how to crypto article will likely cover one or more of these strategies.

The best way to think about leverage is that is a tool. You know what else is a tool? A table saw. A table saw can help you make beautiful furniture if you know how to use it.

If you don't know how to use a table saw it's a lot more likely that you will chop your fingers off and have no furniture to show for it. The same concept applies to leverage. It is a valuable tool if used correctly and separately it's dangerous if used improperly.

Novice traders should not use leverage without understanding risks and proper implementation and I will stand by that statement.

322,""".. the stability of the traditional financial system could be in danger"" - BaFin (German SEC) Risk Report Analysis",116m420,"Today I read the new report (Risks to focus on in 2023) by the German BaFin which is basically the German SEC and I found some interesting points where they talk about crypto and I wanted to share what I've learned after reading it. Since Germany is politically and financially quite influential I think it is interesting to know and they seem they will follow the SEC soon.

""The crypto market involves many risks as recent incidents have shown and further weaknesses were identified. Furthermore, crypto is being used for money laundering and because of low regulations and fraud activities on a huge scale. If the crypto market keeps expanding and it continues to further integrate into the traditional financial system, **the stability of the financial system could be in danger**"".

So basically they are scared af that the crypto market will threaten/ harm the traditional financial system. Kind of interesting actually hearing them say that.

What's also very interesting:

""The business in the crypto market thus should be regulated. There should **be global uniform regulations and comparable strict supervision**.""

Thus, they want to at least work closely together with the SEC. Maybe they will form some type of global crypto supervision, who knows.

Regarding DeFi:

Smart-Contracts can theoretically be a strong competitor of traditional financial intermediaries. \[...\] Even if DeFi is supposed to function without a centralized power, **there needs to be supervision.**

Thus, BaFin seeks to regulate DeFi.

They also keep mentioning how they will continue to warn consumers of all the risks.

TLDR: German SEC (BaFin) wants a global uniform regulatory and supervision because they are scared of crypto.

3,"The truth about TA. Why people think they can time the market, why they draw lines on graphs, why some of them end up being right, and how you can avoid being another monkey with a keyboard.",11w6cb7,"You are a biological machine designed to find patterns.

You need to find patterns to survive, it's the same process that makes you see faces in random objects. It's what drives conspiracy theorists to believe lizards run the world. Our survival is predicated on pattern recognition; when the weather changes, what paths bears take, where the berries grow - it's the most fundamental driver in how you ended up as a monkey with a keyboard on Reddit.

In nature there's two pattern recognition errors you can make, a Type 1 error and Type 2 error. If there's a rustle in the bushes a Type 1 error (false positive) leads you to suspect a tiger where there isn't one. You run away but live to shitpost another day. A Type 2 error (false negative) is to ignore the rustle despite the tiger. Monkeys that make Type 2 errors don't survive to give birth to monkeys with keyboards.

There's not much real debate when we look at the long term studies of traders and firms. They fucking suck dude. Markets are a random walk that trend upwards due to FIAT printing and productivity increases. Any pattern that might have worked gets a counter party that cancels it out. You can't  even get better at trading, since improving at something requires repetitive mistakes and corrections with a limited number of controllable variables.

Despite that, millions of talking monkeys stare at charts looking for patterns like we were designed to do. We find spurious correlations, then we make predictions. If we flip the coin correctly we get a dopamine hit. If we flip the coin correctly a few times in a row we look successful, we give ourselves credit for our decision making, we start a YouTube channel, we get a following because we've been right in the past, we're even fucking rich.

Due to the law of large numbers some of us HAVE to continue to be right. Somebody always wins in a game of heads or tails. Every right guess leads to confirmation bias, any wrong guess creates an addictive form of itermittent reinforcement and is wilfully ignored. The monkeys that win the flip a lot and hide their losses the best get a big following.

Maybe they end up running a hedge fund, some of those hedge funds are successful for predicting the right side of the coinflip. They raise billions of dollars. A few of those billion dollar hedgefunds are successful, they win more flips and grow to enormous sizes.

Eventually they end up on the wrong side of a few flips, they're Almeda capital, they're 3AC. Their predictions don't work and they get wiped out COMPLETELY. They start a fly wheel because it's just been bad luck. They leverage to the tits. They get it wrong and then things blow the fuck up.

Avoid the trap. Ignore the charts and the dumbass arrows. Buy over time, sit on your hands, fight your instincts, eventually reap the rewards from the increase in productivity, network growth and FIAT printing.

5,10 million Moons are owned by addresses that have been completely dormant for over a year,11w63dy,"I looked at all addresses currently holding moons, and found that \~10M moons are held in addresses that have been dormant for over a year.

\~8.9M of these were only active between 1-2 years ago, and \~1.1M moons are in addresses were only active 2+ years ago.

**I define a ""dormant"" address as one that hasn't sent or received moons in a certain time period.** Some other websites only look at transactions from an address when calculating ""dormant"" ones, but I think it doesn't make a lot of sense for Moons, since many users who are still receiving them each month but don't send them out of their vault should be counted as ""active"".

Below lists the breakdown of moon holdings by address latest activity. In this chart, I exclude the Reddit-owned addresses (since you could make the argument that these are either dormant or active) and the 0xdead address used for burning moons.

6,"The transition from ""Groceries used to cost USD 10 per household, it is now USD 100"" to ""Groceries back then used to worth USD 100, it is now USD 10"" if it was running on a deflationary model. Here's a simplistic take on inflationary towards deflationary currencies, and why I think it is crucial.",11w5yda,"One of the issues we are facing is overproduction, and overconsumption. The current inflationary fiat model was created to make sure that your Fiat today would be worth less in the future, hence, you need to spend it to protect the worth, or the system itself encourages you to spend. The closest example would be on how much home prices have risen since the 1950s.

&#x200B;

*1950s: Median home value USD 7,354*

*1950s: Inflation-adjusted to 2020 USD: USD 79,063*

*2020: Median home value: USD 336,900*

&#x200B;

The structure of fiat itself would force vendors to eventually increase their price, to test the ceiling. This is dependent on the demand, and supply. There are other factors involved, but this thread aims to just narrow down the inflationary nature of fiat currencies.

Hoping for the government to lower the price down will not work. It's just against the system. That can only work if the method of payment is based on an appreciating asset. USD, EUR, and other currencies are inflationary. The inflationary nature is forcing is to spend, and consume, and for some of us- overconsuming or overbuying what we need.

This has created businesses which are fixated with growth, instead of sustainability. This has created banks that relies on forecast instead of maintaining its current assets. What Cryptocurrency has allowed us to do is- it has given the accessibility to normal people like us to access appreciating asset which only the rich were able to access back then. Owning BTC, or other cryptocurrencies is now giving us similar perks towards holding a piece of land, or a house- with better liquidity, albeit for different functions.

The story of 10,000 BTC for pizzas will still ring true, and the nature of the currency itself is deterring away from people to use BTC as a form of payment. But here's the thing- this can be good. The adverse effect will eventually happen if deflationary currencies is introduced and adopted to the rest of the world. We might eventually slow down our consumption, and people/businesses would eventually slow down to focus on saving money instead of spending it.

Hence, several indicators are expected to happen. 

\- Wages appraisal would see you getting paid less instead of more, because your currencies are going to worth more in the future. 

\- Businesses would focus more on currencies' retention instead of growth, because the value of the currencies would be the 'asset' or expansion plan.

7,"What do you consider to be ""mass adoption""?",11w5rnb,"The way I see it, there are 2 reasons for someone to hold crypto:

1. Hold it as an investment, meaning hold it as a store of value, or to make money (or both)
2. Use it to transact, or with certain coins, use it to participate in some part of the ecosystem

However, getting the average person interested enough to do either of these is not easy.

Take investing for an example. When you venture out of the online communities surrounding trading and investing, you can see that most people either

1. Don't have money to invest
2. Simply auto-contribute to retirement accounts
3. If they have enough, hire a financial advisor manage their money for them

So for a lot of people, if you want to get them to invest in crypto, you not only have to get them to start investing on their own, but you need them to think investing in crypto is a good idea (and we all know crypto has an image problem).

The other reason to hold crypto is to use it for transactions or to participate in the ecosystem of a coin or token.

For transactions, while I know plenty of people use it in countries with absurdly high inflation, and to send money to people in other countries, there currently isn't a very large need for the average person to use it to transact.

Regarding the use of crypto in the ecosystem of a coin, there's a whole different set of challenges with that, assuming someone gets past the image problem of crypto and wants to start using it. Not only does it generally have a higher barrier to entry in knowledge and funds, the potential to make a mistake or get scammed when transferring crypto between different wallets and chains is much higher. I would guess that the average person in this sub doesn't even do this often (including me), so it's a pretty daunting task for a newcomer to crypto. And don't even get me started on taxes.

I wanna hear some really interesting stuff. I'm still new to crypto but of course I've already heard everyone and their roommate say ""crypto will replace fiat currencies and become the global standard for money"". Blah blah blah, that's an easy one. I wanna hear from people who maybe have a deeper understanding of crypto or maybe other areas of life, who can come up with some wild ideas of how crypto will change life on this planet. Maybe something like crypto enabling interplanetary trade and colonization. That's a little more interesting. 

So, do you have any other wild hypotheses that you want to share? Please do so in the comments below. I'm looking forward to reading your responses!",grundlesquatch,131,15,0.76

10,Bullish on Credit Suisse takeover,11w3y9t,"It's official - UBS has confirmed its takeover of Credit Suisse. This is a major development in the financial industry, and it has the potential to impact many different areas, including the world of blockchain technology.

&#x200B;

UBS is one of the largest financial institutions in the world, with a strong presence in both traditional banking and investment banking. By taking over Credit Suisse, UBS will become an even more dominant player in the financial industry. This could lead to increased investment in many different areas, including blockchain technology.

&#x200B;

UBS has been bullish on blockchain technology in the past, and there are reasons to believe that this trend will continue with the takeover of Credit Suisse. Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize many different areas of the financial industry, from payments to securities trading to asset management.

&#x200B;

With the increased resources and expertise that UBS will have access to after the takeover, it's possible that we will see even more investment in blockchain technology. This could lead to the development of new and innovative blockchain solutions that could benefit many different industries.

&#x200B;

Of course, as with any major development in the financial industry, there are risks involved. The takeover of Credit Suisse could lead to job losses and other negative consequences. But overall, it's an exciting time for those who are interested in the potential of blockchain technology.

&#x200B;

So what does this mean for Banano Coin? Well, Banano Coin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the NANO blockchain. While it's impossible to say for sure how the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse will impact Banano Coin specifically, it's possible that increased investment in blockchain technology could lead to more institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space overall.

&#x200B;

As always, it's important to do your own research before making any investment decisions. But one thing is clear - the future of blockchain technology is looking very bright, and the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse is just one example of the many developments that are taking place in this exciting and rapidly-evolving field.",pm_me_4,70,4,0.58
11,Even after DYOR you can't be 100% sure what will happen to a currency.,11w3jlz,"Greetings from Portugal.

So I belive most of us already know what to look on a currency. Even if you're a starter this sub offers you really good guides on how to DYOR.

But unless you have a ball of crystal, projects outside top100 have always a ''gamble'' factor when you invest in them. 

And that's because **there are many information that isn't public!**

**Secretly lending customer funds, market-making against their own customers, intricate webs of counterparty relationships, issuing their own tokens and distributing them to insiders, and so on.**

None of that nonsense can be researched, and it is these that cause the most significant movements in cryptocurrency. ""DYOR"" works only when the market is at least partially transparent. Free markets can only function when everyone is (roughly) on the same playing field. THAT is why publicly traded companies must issue regular earnings reports that are open to the public, and why financial institutions must undergo third-party audits.

I would love to hear the community thoughts on this!

12,OHM from Olympus Dao is never coming back. Or is it?,11w37rg,"You guys remember OHM right? It was the smash hit of the 2021 bull run. During Q4 the roar for this project was euphoric. Everyone and their grandmother was trying ot get some OHm and sOHM. Then late that year a proposal came about for a new token called gOHM which became a governance token  which replaced wsOHM as part of the v2 migration. gOHM wraps sOHM V2, which allows you to use sOHM V2 on different blockchains. When v2 was announced you could feel the confusion on twitter, reddit and all over. Once the migration happened people sold their OHM like their life depended on it and the price of OHM crashed from a whopping $1,320 per token to what is noa mere $10 per token. It has been flatlined at this price during the entire bear market.

Olympus DAO is a community-owned, decentralized and censorship-resistant reserve currency that is asset-backed, deeply liquid and used widely across Web3. Its treasury balance  currently sits at $237,978,889

The dilemma Olympus Dao claims it wants to solve. Pay attention here because this is at the crux of a lot of issues we have in crypto.

"" Dollar-pegged stablecoins have become an essential part of crypto due to their lack of volatility as compared to tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether. Users are comfortable with transacting using stablecoins knowing that they hold the same amount of purchasing power today vs. tomorrow. But this is a fallacy. The dollar is controlled by the US government and the Federal Reserve. This means a depreciation of the dollar also means a depreciation of these stablecoins. Olympus aims to solve Web3’s reliance on centralized, censorable stablecoin assets by creating a non-pegged reserve currency called OHM that is backed by a basket of assets. Olympus actively utilizes its Treasury as a counterbalance to the market  and to grow the econOHMy.""

This is key because stable coin regulaton is undoubtedly coming soon and coming with sury and the dollar value is quickly dropping so does it make a little sense now? 

Personally I think OHM is a legit project but it got way too confusing for people when the migration to v2 took place. People did no understand the logic between rebasing tokens like sOHm vs gOHM and OHM and wsOHM. It was simply too much. Plus add the gwei prices at that time and it was tough to stay in. So people sold. The prisoners dilemma was too much for the common Joe investor who literally came in to just ape and run out the door to stay.

IMO OHM has a legitimate chance to make a strong comeback. Few project do. Some that come to mind are VeChain, XLM, Loopring, ICP, Avalanche and so many others. Some have actually perished.

OHM can make a comeback because the defi ecosystem may need it and WEB3 can use it. Remeber this part in a year or two.  ***Provide the growing Web3 financial ecosystem with a censorship-resistant currency that preserves purchasing power, has deep liquidity, is trusted and used widely as a unit of account.***

**First things to do - check eligibility and get your vault on Metamask.**

The first thing you should do is check if your are getting any ARB tokens air dropped to your wallet, you can check that in the link below.

[https://arbitrum.foundation/](https://arbitrum.foundation/)

you simply connect your wallet which will add the Arbitrum One network and will then give you the option to check eligibility.

If you do not have your vault on metamask to be able to interact with the site you can follow u/Gabesters detailed post about how to getting your vault on Metamask at the link below.

&#x200B;

**Where will you be able to sell ARB token?**

The current centralized exchanges that have confirmed they will be trading ARB on the 23rd

* MEXC - ARB/USDT
* Huobi - ARB/USDT & ARB/USDD
* Bybit - ARB/USDT & ARB/USDC
* OKX - ARB/USDT & ARB/USDC
* Bitrue - coming soon but not confirmed to be available on the 23rd

You can also check different DEXs to see if anybody has set up a pool for you to be able to sell ARB but make sure to check the available liquidity so you wont swap $1,000 worth of ARB for $1.00 worth of USCD. 

some of the bigger DEXs that support Arbitrum one

* SushiSwap
* GMX
* Curve
* Uniswap
* Balancer

**ARB token price predictions**

nobody really knows but since Arbitrum is the 4th largest chain by TVL people are estimating anywhere from $0.60 to $10.00 with the majority believing it will probably be around $1.50 a token.

**What to expect after the drop**

We can see what happened with the Optimism airdrop to try and get an idea of what the ARB airdrop will look like.

https://preview.redd.it/e6r603n8asoa1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c05620ce09be5882e536b6dac4acae576cd3ba1

The sharp drop you see on the left was over the course of about two days, the price dropped from $2.89 to $1.20 then continued falling for about a month reaching a low of $0.45 and then about two months after the drop stared going back up not reaching the $3.00 range until February of 2023.

We can pretty confidently assume that the ARB token price will drop incredible fast as the majority will sell right away and will probably continue to drop for at least a month. If you wish to sell you will need to move incredibly fast to try and beat the bots and users who will be waiting.

**Should you sell?**

we will continue using Optimism as our example - Optimism first Airdrop was June 2022 and they surprised users of the Optimism L2 with a second airdrop January 2023. 

We don't know how the ARB token will perform or if Arbitrum will follow Optimism doing a second airdrop so it's really up to you if you choose to sell your ARB tokens.

Congrats to those expecting the ARB token airdrop and be careful trading.",Odlavso,88,10,0.63

On Reddit, Vitalik Buterin talked about the
importance of multisig wallets and social
recovery wallets.

Vitalik said in his post that: 

""A close cousin of multisig wallets is social
recovery
wallets, where a single key can be used to
sign
transactions but if that key is lost, a group of
keys held
by other people can be used to recover the
funds. Social
recovery wallets are much easier than
multisig wallets
to use, especially with the rise of ERC-4337
account
abstraction.""

""Both multisig wallets and social recovery wallets rely on
a concept of guardians: a set of N addresses, typically
held by other people, of which any M can approve an
operation (eg. one could set N=6 and M=4). In the case
of a multisig wallet, each transaction must be signed
off on by M of the N guardians. In the case of a social
recovery wallet, there is a single key that can sign
transactions, but if that key is lost, M of the N guardians
must sign a message to reset the key.""

If you are intersted in reading more, you can find Vitalik's post on the Ethereum subreddit.

20,A Multichain User's Perspective - Solanashaming,11w10hs,"Let me start off by saying that Arbitrum has quickly become my favorite chain currently, and I use several chains every single day including Cosmos, Eth, EVMs, L2s, and yes, Solana. I'll try to give a level-headed, good-faith explanation of why I still think Solana is important. I hold no Solana but I hold eth and arb alts. I'm talking about the chain here.

&#x200B;

* It appears that many in the community are focused on the price aspect of cryptocurrencies, and it seems that a majority only engage with a single or couple of blockchains just to hold coins, or are otherwise content with paying high fees (such as a crazy \~$3 fee for listing an NFT for sale or the $8-10 for a single trade on Ethereum currently). There's more that we can do with blockchains outside of finance. 
* While Ethereum is more decentralized than Solana, and Arbitrum is not as decentralized as Ethereum, Solana can still serve as an effective gateway to blockchains (not just crypto) for millions of newcomers from platforms like Binance and other centralized entities that have even more centralized control and risky market dominance than less decentralized chains like Solana and Arbitrum/Optimism.
* Millions of users may not be able to afford Ethereum or even Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, which, despite not being as decentralized as Ethereum, are still significantly more expensive, less built out and more complicated to use than Solana. 
* For reference, a single Solana tx is about 1/10 to 1/100th the cost of a single Arbitrum tx, and in many countries with high populations but weaker currencies, that adds up.
* 1 Ethereum tx is about 144,000 joules while 1 Solana tx is about 3,290 joules. BTC is a WHOPPING 5 billion joules (not an argument against btc).
* It's important to acknowledge that Solana was previously influenced by SBF, but his sway has diminished, and there's fresh hope and resurgence in the Sol community, which comprises many similar individuals as the Ethereum and Cosmos communities.
* If you're not involved in DeFi, Solana's advantages can still be beneficial, and downtime might not affect you significantly. More importantly, it allows you to participate in the cryptocurrency space in ways that others may not be able to.
* For example, have you explored high frequency NFT lending/borrowing protocols? Or participated in a Twitch-style collective Pokémon game where everyone votes on-chain for the next move? What about engaging in high-frequency on-chain trading, executing dozens of transactions per minute?

It's worth considering giving these experiences a try on the Solana blockchain, or at least not shaming those that do. This way, when such activities become more affordable and accessible on your preferred blockchain, you'll already have valuable experience and an edge over others. 

TLDR: let's acknowledge the trade-offs between decentralization and accessibility, and explore the diverse possibilities offered by different blockchains. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and robust cryptocurrency ecosystem that benefits everyone. The continued widespread use of Solana, despite a particularly challenging year that could have killed many other chains, attests to its vibrant developer and user community, who interact with each other directly and often intersect. 

Instead of dismissing other blockchain platforms or criticizing those who are exploring them, why don't we broaden our horizons and have some fun while learning about the diverse possibilities that exist within the cryptocurrency ecosystem?

The Excitement is enticing and contagious as Algorand locks in one partnership after another, but behind the scenes... **A Series of Unfortunate Events** are Begining to Unwind, and what was once a promising blockchain to laugh and make jokes about - is quietly becoming a disaster for investors.

*This post is not a technical breakdown of Algorand nor is this post meant to fud the future of Algorand. This post is about the absolute disaster that continues to unravel for investors of the Algorand Blockchain.*

\------------------------------

# I. A Brief Introduction to Algorand:

If someone told you about Algorand they probably also told you [it was founded by Silvio Micali](https://www.algorand.com/about/our-history)  ""a cryptography pioneer, Turing award winner and MIT professor"".  Algorand launched in 2019 and hails itself as a [Pure Proof of Stake](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/proof-of-stake-vs-pure-proof-of-stake-consensus) (PPOS). The most notable difference from traditional Proof of Stake (POS), is that the creator of the next block is selected randomly irrespective of their total stake. As the name implies this approach is touted by Algorand supporters as a more fair and decentralized version of POS.

\------------------------------

# II. The Beginning of an Inflationary Nightmare for Investors:

Like most crypto projects Algorand absolutely blew up in 2021, it started the year under $.40 and it ended the yearover 4x around \~$1.65. However unlike most crypto projects that peaked in early November Algorand peaked in September.

https://preview.redd.it/0jgjkqekoloa1.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0540237e29d4dfa335b523e55567438f4d6bac96

What sounds like an interesting side note, holds a much darker truth for investors - [Algorand inflated by 533% in 2021](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vu26qy/the_great_algo_mass_inflation_event_of_2021_the/), as the circulating supply jumped from 1.19B to 6.37B - and [12% in 2022](https://messari.io/asset/algorand/chart/sply-circ) from 6.37B to 7.14B. If you line up the graph for the increase in circulating supply to price, you can see the September 2021 peak lined up with a large surge in the circulating supply and a steady drop in price since.

\------------------------------

# III. A Controversial Change in Leadership

In [January of 2022](https://np.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/sh3sjs/its_been_two_days_since_sean_lee_was_quietly/) the prior CEO of the Algorand Foundation was quietly ousted from the company, and replaced with the [new CEO](https://www.algorand.foundation/news/staci-warden-ceo) Staci Warden. The replacement has been incredibly controversial inside the Algorand Community as the new Foundation CEO thought one of the major priorities for the Algorand Foundation was to focus on PR.

[https:\/\/twitter.com\/StaciW\_DC\/status\/1499202881647489025](https://preview.redd.it/wcte440qsqoa1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ecde4f2134230b85311494f3d0ec6eb991e64a66)

Additionally [she's been largely criticized](https://np.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/xfillm/please_calm_down/) for acting childish and immature in her public statements - with statements that are meant to create ""baseless hype"" which leads to Algorand believers holding even larger underwater bags. If you have ever heard of Staci before it's probably for her, [""Nike"" tweet](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10ex14q/ceo_of_the_algorand_foundation_decides_to_troll/).

https://preview.redd.it/ds8gyyfxuqoa1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=593304e3f54223d61b871f44680296f7da09aaed

This one word tweet, lead people to believe big things were imminent for Algorand Investors with a potential Nike Partnership. Instead it was later revealed that Staci had hired a former Nike Executive as the Chief Marketing Officer for Algorand.

\------------------------------

# IV. A Disaster in ""Marketing"" - Part 1: An Introduction

If you are familiar with Algorand Tokenomics you probably know, Algorand has a max supply of 10B and the beginning Centralization of Tokens with the Algorand team was one of the worst things about Algorand.

https://preview.redd.it/1r9ia3fgipoa1.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a111431c6627db5d07221895633d3beaf95d996

As you can see, Algorand itself was one of the initial largest holder of Algorand. When a Crypto organization needs to raise funds - they do that by selling their tokens, and that's exactly what the Algorand Foundation did. To the Foundations credit, they make bi-annual Transparency Reports that detail how much they sold and sometimes what those funds were used for. Below is a breakdown of the sales from October 2020 - September 2022 time period. Links to Transparency Reports information was gathered from: [1](https://www.algorand.foundation/transparency-report-march-2021), [2](https://www.algorand.foundation/transparency-report-september-2021), [3](https://www.algorand.foundation/transparency-report-march-2022), [4](https://www.algorand.foundation/transparency-report-oct-2022) .

[Numbers in Algo](https://preview.redd.it/maa0hbvxupoa1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ea363ae8836441bd799ab88b589530f09c95bd5)

&#x200B;

In the Past two years the Algorand Foundation has sold 228M Algo and Paid their Board of Directors another 3.65M Algo. **Important:** these numbers do not include Algo given out for for ecosystem development - That includes another \~400M Algo over two years, some of which may have also been sold.

# A Disaster in ""Marketing"" - Part 2: Partnerships

The past few years have been huge for Partnerships with Algorand, it seemed like every week the Algorand Foundation was announcing a new partnership. But most of these were just glorified real-world Sponsorships that Algorand paid for, that came with an Agreement to do do something on the Algorand blockchain, like FIFAs NFT flop.

Announced in May 2022, [Algorand became the official blockchain partner of FIFA](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/03/algorand-scores-fifa-partnership-algo-prices-surge/). Immediately after the announcement the price of Algorand spiked 20%, but what investors had hoped would be game changing for the Algorand network - ended up as just another disappointment. In September 2022, FIFA launched an NFT project on the Algorand Blockchain - with over 205,000 mints, at a cost of $5 each and low resale interest: the project just ended up being a further $1M cash grab for FIFA.

[The Algorand Logo was not on display as a partner during the Fifa world cup.](https://twitter.com/StaciW_DC/status/1595149753066541056) Additionally there was not an ad or Algorand TV Spot during the world cup, something Algorand supporters had hoped to see.

# A Disaster in ""Marketing"" - Part 3: Advertisements

Of course the money for this publicity stunt, had to come from somewhere, and that money came from dumping Algo on Investors. From April - September 2022.

23,Why Do LP Fees & APR Fluctuate So Much?,11vzxlf,"LP noob here so forgive me if the answer is obvious to most. The fluctuation in APR and pool fees seems pretty dramatic from a first timer's perspective.

What causes this fluctuation?

Is it determined TVL, daily volume or some other metric?

Since I am not experienced with LPs I am not sure if this is common across all LPs or if it is isolated to specific LPs due to the TVL and daily volume. Seems like a lot of work to adjust the fees and APR, unless of course it is done algorithmically. I suspect it's an algorithm because any kind of manual adjustments seem absolutely insane.

If it is not determined by TVL or daily volume, then what dictates the fluctuation? The only other thing I can think of is the TVL to Market Cap ratio.

[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/16/playboy-lost-49m-on-ethereum-it-accepted-as-nft-payments/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/16/playboy-lost-49m-on-ethereum-it-accepted-as-nft-payments/)

""PLBY  Group (PLBY), the parent company of the late Hugh Hefner's Playboy  enterprise, said it took an impairment loss of $4.9 million on the ether  (ETH) it held last year, as crypto winter created a significant decline  in the broader market prices.

The lifestyle and media company said it accepted ether as payments for its “[Rabbitars](https://opensea.io/collection/playboyrabbitars)” non-fungible tokens ([NFT](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-nfts-and-how-do-they-work/)) launched in 2021, which it holds in its balance sheet as digital assets, according to an [annual filing on Thursday](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1803914/000180391423000017/ply-20221231.htm). The value of the digital assets sits at $327,000 as of last year, the filing said.

A [previous filing](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/d9088661-8cbe-4704-92ed-69a9895734fc) shows the company's digital assets, which it refers to as Ethereum, were worth $1.75 million as of Sept. 30, 2022.

The  company explained that the company accounts for its digital assets as  “indefinite-lived intangible assets,” which are subject to impairment  losses if the fair value of the assets fall below their carrying value,  at any time. The impairment losses the company takes on the digital  assets can’t be recovered, even if the fair value of the assets rise  after taking the impairment losses.

“The  market price of one \[ether\] in our principal market ranged from $964 to  $3,813 during the year ended Dec. 31, 2022, but the carrying value of  each Ethereum we held at the end of the reporting period reflects the  lowest price of one Ethereum quoted on the active exchange at any time  since its receipt,” according to the filing. ""Therefore, negative swings  in the market price of Ethereum could have a material impact on the  company's earnings and carrying value, while only time a rise in prices  will impact the company’s earnings positively, is when the Ethereum held  in the balance sheet, are sold at a gain,"" the filing said.

The company [launched its “Rabbitar” NFT project](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/20/2317683/0/en/Playboy-launches-new-NFT-project-Rabbitars.html)  in October 2021, during the peak of the crypto market. Ether, the  native token of the Ethereum blockchain, lost about 60% in value since  October 2021, according to TradingView data.

Earlier  in 2021, Playboy entered into NFT and blockchain technology industry  with its NFT drop called “Liquid Summer,” which is a collection of  digital artworks created in collaboration with the artist Slimesunday.  The collection, which minted in May 2021, features archival photographs  of Playboy model [Lenna Sjööblom](https://www.wired.com/story/finding-lena-the-patron-saint-of-jpegs/) – the so-called “First Lady of the Internet.”

However, these NFT drops weren’t the first foray for the company into the world of digital assets. In 2018, Playboy TV began [accepting bitcoin (BTC) payments](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/14/playboy-tv-to-accept-crypto-payments-for-adult-content/).

This chart is a way to represent it, it is estimated that the cost of mining one BTC last year actually was more than the value of that one BTC on spot prices, thus miners were mining in losses. To cover their losses they had to sell their holdings, which further caused the markets to drop, and even their equipments.

29,Re-imagining the financial system with cryptocurrencies as the central store of value,11vy9gc,"# The history of our current financial crisis

It is becoming more and more apparent that our current financial system which was built in the 1930's is not fit for the modern times. Here I will try to explain some of the issues with our current economic system and relate it to why it will eventually have to fail. I will then propose how cryptocurrency could be integrated into our current financial system to create a more resilient and fair system for all.

Our story begins in 1933 Franklin Roosevelt it is the time of the great depression. Banks are collapsing for a variety of reasons but a main one was that they had taken a lot of risky bets on the stock market which crashed in 1929 leaving many banks in a bad financial position. This eventually created a run on the banks with them not having enough money to pay out the money people had put in. Now the governments hands were tied because the money they could print was based on the amount of gold they had. This made it impossible for the government to restart the economy by injecting cash into the economy. All of this lead to a complete halt of the financial system. No trade was happening nobody was lending to anyone and nobody was willing to trust banks. Meaning nobody was spending money which caused more businesses to collapse leading to massive unemployment and even less money being spent. The economy was in a death spiral that threatened to actually lead to the death of millions.

This was when Roosevelt intervened by taking the US Dollar of the gold standard. This gave the government the ability to invest in the economy and get it ""unstuck"". The New York Times [quotes](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=980DE1D9143BEF3ABC4851DFB2668388629EDE)  J.P. Morgan saying at the time, “It seems to me clear that the way out of the  depression is to combat and overcome the deflationary forces. Therefore,  I regard the action now taken as being the best possible course under  existing circumstances.”  Basically the best way out of a recession is to follow economic principles. If your money is losing value then it is best to spend it now because in the future it will not be worth as much.

Now this leads us to 2008 the first major financial crisis that threatened to mirror the great depression. Basically wall street has gotten greedy. They found a way to game the system by giving out bad loans and the bundling them together in a flaming ball of trash and claiming they were as solid as gold. During this period banks were making enormous amounts of cash and bankers were getting rich because they did not carry any of the risks for these loans but got fat bonuses for making them. When the system eventually collapsed it threatened to cause another great depression, this time governments and central banks intervened early. They bailed out the banks using tax payer money and managed to prevent another death spiral.

However there was a major difference in the approach this time. Instead of the banks being punished for making bad financial decisions with them becoming bankrupt and the bankers losing their job they received massive bonuses. They then proceeded to take the governments money, tax payers money, our money to just restart gambling right away. How did the banking grift work? Well basically the government said to stave of a depression we need to get people spending. To get people spending we need to make sure people can borrow money. So to make sure banks give out money we will allow the banks to access money for close to 0% interest as well as pump massive amounts of cash into the system through quantitative easing. However, the banks instead of loaning out to people and small businesses realized they could make much more profit by investing this money in large businesses and stocks compared to giving a small business a good loan.

This was the fatal mistake of the government and Satoshi saw it 15 years in advance. He knew that the greed of the bankers would never be satisfied. In a way it was the tale of the frog and the scorpion where the scorpion asks the frog ""can you give me a ride across the river?"" The frog says ""no you will sting me and I will die"". The scorpion responds ""No if I sting you in the river I will drown and nobody wants that."" So the frog lets the scorpion climb on and starts swimming as he gets about half way across he suddenly feels a sharp sting in his back. He laments ""Why did you sting me now we will both die?"" To which the scorpion just responds ""well I'm  a scorpion"".

So now we have the banks receiving essentially free money that they are turning into massive profits for themselves and those with assets in the stock market. Meanwhile the actual economy continues to struggle. People are having their spending power gradually eroded as things creep up in price but there is no change in the wages people receive. This all culminates in what we have today. Another financial crisis, banks are again overexposed to risks from financial downturn despite having over a decade of near perfect conditions to make money. They again threaten and blackmail us with ""well if you don't save us people will earn their hard earned money"". Now with runaway inflation eating at the little money that people are able to earn they again try to blame workers saying you need to cut back you are being to greedy and it is driving inflation.

So what will happen is this loop of banks abusing their position of power in our financial system to create wealth for themselves while knowing that any risks will eventually be covered by the government.

# How Cryptocurrency can create a more just financial system

Now we can see that banks are itself the problem they are a scorpion that will sting us over and over. My question then is well if the taxpayer keeps bailing out banking institutions why do we not get a share in the profit from the risk we take on? My proposal is as follows. The central bank becomes the main creditor of loans giving out the same deals that they give out to banks but instead of the banks turning a huge profit and dumping the risk on the tax payer it would be the state that benefits. They could also direct investment to be of long term social benefits for example by providing good loans to small businesses. The investment strategy would change from maximizing profits to maximizing the good done for the country all while being supervised and guided by the people with people being able to influence where investments are made.

This leaves us with the big question. Now banks are superfluous, no longer needed a lump of fat cut out and discarded. So how would people store their money? Well here is where cryptocurrency finally comes in. People would be able to store their money in cryptocurrency. For people that want to have just a savings account the government will provide a central bank issued cryptocurrency that is equal to a dollar. This reflects the truth that many people want to hold just a dollar and while they will slowly lose value it is what most people want. Furthermore businesses would quickly pop up that would allow you to store your cryptodollars. However, these businesses would not be allowed to do fractional reserve banking, they would have to hold your assets 1:1. This means that they would charge you a fee for this service but this is recommended for a lot of people that do not want the hassle of holding their own money. However, the option would be there to hold it yourself free for ever.

Then finally we get to traditional cryptocurrencies. These would be subject to volatility and trends in market and so on but bitcoin is known to be deflationary and could represent a good investment for the long term. It allows people a safe place to deposit their holdings long term. Additional cryptos with different functionalities could all be available and easily traded in and out off.

# Conclusion

So in summary I think we need to abolish consumer based banks that take consumer deposits and practice fractional reserve banking. Instead it would be replaced by a democratically led investment process where the inhabitants of a country reap the benefits of their economy doing well instead of it being funneled to a wealth few. Consumer banks would be replaced by central bank cryptocurrency that functions just like a US Dollar and people looking to grow their wealth over a long period of time could seamlessly convert in and out of bitcoin as well as other assets suiting their risk tolerance. We deserve a modern financial system that caters to the needs of the many not just the few. Thank you for reading this and I look forward to hearing any comments.",Betaglutamate2,20,2,0.57
30,"You are always ""early"" to Crypto",11vxvxw,"In the past few days I've seen a few posts about being early, not being early, when being early is over, etc.

I've been in the space since 2017 and fully thought I missed the boat. Bought in at around 7 for Bitcoin and started dabbling in ETH at around 300 bucks. Rode Bitcoin all the way to 20k and ETH to 1300 and down again.

Man did I think I had egg on my face. I was way too late and everyone who had bought before 2017, they were the lucky ""early ones"". 

Then the run of 2021 arrived and I saw the fruits of my due diligence and DCA and saw my portfolio skyrocket.

And more importantly, I saw many new people join the space the same way I did in 2017. Fresh faced and full of hopes and dreams. The same ones who are now deep in the red or barely even in their portfolios. And potentially questioning, was all that ""early stuff"" bullcrap?

Yes, I get it, the higher the market cap, the more it theoretically takes to grow and the less astronomical the bigger caps will grow.
But at the same time I've seen so many new promising projects emerge in the past few years that did amazing things and grew their marketcaps amazingly as well. And I'm sure there will be plenty of those that will succeed in the long run, regardless of how many won't. And all those who took a chance and invested in those made it out big.

My point is, I believe we will *always be early*. It will just eventually shift from the bigger blue chips as they amass more and more in terms of MC. In that sense, I don't have any problem liking it to the regular stock market. You're not ""late"" to the stock market, companies will emerge and technologies will be discovered. And many new opportunities will arise.

So yeah, maybe in a few years, maybe now, we won't be ""early"" for Bitcoin, or even ETH (if early means going 10x in a relatively short amount of time)

But if one adjusts what *early* means and just takes into account that innovation in the crypto imo won't stop, we won't ever have to be ""late"". I've experienced it myself during last run and I'm pretty confident I will next time and the time after next.

In the words of a certain wizard: *we are not late nor are we early, we are here precisely when we mean to be.* (OK that didn't fit 100% but you kno2 what I mean!) :😀",transfermymoons,122,16,0.65

As the banking crisis starts, I am considering investing my money into bitcoin again.

However, I suffered losses in 2021, and I am starting to get afraid of whales and institutions making moves to take our money out again.

They created the bank crisis to push us into all sorts of investments, one of which is crypto. As we don't have trust in banks (which has been brewing for a while and culminating with this crisis), we start investing in bitcoin/crypto. After the coin marketing again reaches out high market cap, the institutions and/or whales play the same game they played in 2021, pulling in and out to take our money out.

33,"[SERIOUS] When will we no longer say ""we are still early""?",11vx2rs,"One of our most common sayings on the sub is ""we are still early"", but when will we actually not be early anymore? Crypto started in 2009, so we are 14 years in, id agree that's still early. So what are the benchmarks that will determine we have become established and no longer early. A short list of where we stand:

\-Currently there are almost 23,000 different crypto's

\-56 different countries have favorable regulations of crypto

\-2 countries have adopted it as legal tender

\-Crypto has become integrated into platforms and technology

\-There are real world uses for blockchain and NFT's

\-Over 1 trillion market cap

&#x200B;

The two key factors we need are awareness and behavioral intent. I believe most people are aware of crypto unless living off grid. So that means we need behavioral intent, which is a willingness to adapt to technology. Some great examples are the internet and smart phones. The internet came around in 1990's and was not well accepted, But by the 2000's it was everything and everywhere. The same can be said for the smart phone. iPhone 1st came out in 2007, and by 2011 everyone had to have a smart phone. Adoption can definitely be quick or painfully slow.

&#x200B;

Will you be able to access your wallets if the paper you wrote your seed phrases gets destroyed? Have you practiced losing your phone? What about losing both your phone *and* your computer? Would your family be able to access your crypto if something were to happen to you? You ever think how your life would change if you lost all your crypto? Would you be able to pay your bills, or have any emergency funds? What if you immediately needed to liquidate all your crypto? 

These are questions we never want to see , but we *should* be able to answer them just in case. I was recently thinking about how I would go if something were to happen to my phone, and realized losing both my phone and pc would put me in a very difficult situation. I thought well that's an extremely unlikely thing but extremely unlikely things happen to a lot of people everyday...

**Hot wallet and Cold wallet :**

A hot wallet like metamask is convinient and it makes the trading or use of cryptocurrency simple, it is connected to the internet and may be exposed to cyber assaults, which might result in lost fund. You need both the hot wallet for short-term trading and the cold wallet for long-term holding since a cold wallet is often not linked to the internet.

**Smart contract permission:**

If you fall for a scam or click on a dubious link, you might come across a malicious smart contract (SC) that will steal funds from your hot or hard wallet if you give it permission. Check the permissions needed for the SC and revoke any previous contracts you don't need by following this helpful step-by-step guide [https://ethereum.org/en/guides/how-to-revoke-token-access/](https://ethereum.org/en/guides/how-to-revoke-token-access/) .

38,The Area Above The Bear: Why I Believe The Cycle Bottom Is In,11vw3v5,"**Intro:**

I haven't seen a technical approach like this one described on this sub before (or on YouTube; no Twitter account), so here goes. If it turns out this is common knowledge and even your grandmother is familiar with this analysis, then go ahead and downvote this post out of sight.

I wondered if the cycle bottom could be identified essentially in real time as it occurs by looking at the cumulative drawdown from the previous all-time high (I like to say PATH) over time, or the total amount of pain the market has felt on the way down.

In this way, a quite severe bear market that plummeted quickly and stayed really low for a relatively short time would inflict a similar amount of pain to a bear market that bled slowly and not so far down, but took forever to do it.

**Method with previous cycles:**

Knowing the tops and bottoms from the bear markets beginning in Nov. 2013 and Dec. 2017, respectively, I added up the percent loss from the PATH for each weekly close from top to bottom. This total has some funky unit like ""percent weeks"" or something like that, but the point is that it's a measure of the accumulated pain since the top.

For example, if the weekly close peaked for the 2013 bull run at $1,205.70 on Nov. 24, 2013, and the weekly close for Dec. 1, 2013 was $697, then for that week we would have (1205.70 - 697.00) / 1205.70 = 0.42, or 42%. For the weekly close that marked the cycle bottom (Jan. 11, 2015 at $199.60), we have (1205.70 - 199.60) / 1205.70 = 0.83, or 83%. The proportion or percent loss is always measured from the PATH, not the previous week. If you add up all those weeks from top to bottom, you get **33.3** (proportions expressed as decimals), or 3330%. That's the Area Above The Bear, the cumulative pain experienced from top to bottom.

[Area Above The Bear = Sum of the bars = 33.3](https://preview.redd.it/b1s47uyq3roa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b119e804a2326e21e27b72de1cc1ad5777b2672f)

For the bear market beginning after the 2017 blow-off, I have a peak weekly close of $19,345.50 on Dec. 10, 2017, and a weekly bottom of $3,228.70 on Dec. 9, 2018. The Area Above The Bear from top to bottom was **30.6**, or 3060 ""percent weeks"".

[Area Above The Bear = Sum of the bars = 30.6](https://preview.redd.it/a6cjk81t3roa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1570bff7751039a412e51712f509dba775d59500)

**This bear market:**

Now to the present bear market, where we don't really know for sure that the bottom has been printed (even if you think you know for sure, in which case I'll trust you, bro).

I have the weekly top at $64,398.60 on Nov. 7, 2021, and a low *so far* of $16,456.50 on Nov. 20, 2022. The Area Above The Bear for that period is **27.3**, or 2730 % weeks of pain.

[Area Above The Bear = Sum of the bars = 27.3](https://preview.redd.it/iv3wt7204roa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89c2e79ba3bdd7ede9bece7052071c1aa83a5c64)

So for the last three bear markets, assuming the bottom for the present one has printed, the Area Above The Bear has been \~ 33, 30, and 27. I think this number shrinking over time makes sense; just as the returns on the way up are diminishing over time, so should the losses on the way down.

|Bear market beginning|Area Above The Bear|Status|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nov. 2013|33.3|Confirmed, historical|
|Dec. 2017|30.6|Confirmed, historical|
|Nov. 2021|27.3|Unconfirmed, present|

As a gut-check, I assumed that the present bear market had not yet bottomed, and continued counting out to the end of February of this year. The Area Above The Bear from Nov. 20, 2022 to Feb. 26, 2023 is 36.8, larger than the known top-to-bottom areas from the prior two bear markets. **That makes it seem likely that the low for this cycle really was in November of 2022.**

**What about closes from other time scales?**

I did a similar analysis with **daily closes**, instead of weekly, and got a very similar answer. The daily Area Above The Bear was a number about 7 times larger than the weekly version for all three cycles. That makes sense, since there are 7 times as many bars.

|Bear Market Beginning|Area Above The Bear, Daily Closes|
|:-|:-|
|Dec. 4, 2013|217.6|
|Dec. 16, 2017|213.4|
|Nov. 8, 2021|193.6|

I'm lazy and haven't done the analysis with **monthly closes**. If someone wants to do that, then feel free. I suspect the numbers are about 1/4 the size as for the weekly analysis.

I think weekly closes are a nice time scale to use. Frankly, you don't need to know the bottom right down to the very day, and the certainty will be less anyway. If you expand out to a month, you could only find out several weeks after the fact that the bottom had hit. That's not the worst thing in the world, but decent-sized swings can occur in the space of two or three weeks.

**Uses and next time around:**

For the next bear market, which will inevitably begin in 2025 (trust me, bro), I expect that the Area Above The Bear will reach \~24 when the bottom is printed.

While this method won't predict when or where the bottom occurs, it will let you know *right after* the bottom has happened (if you trust it). That will allow you to buy in the next bear (or this one) with confidence that the price won't drop below the identified bottom.

I personally don't trust any technical method enough to abandon a DCA strategy for accumulation next time around (after the peak in 2025, trust me). However, I think I will hold a good chunk of powder on the side, and make a relatively large buy when the next Area Above The Bear reaches \~24.

\*\*\*My historical data may not be perfect, since it's hard to get weekly close data from 2013 for free. I got some of it from [investing.com](https://investing.com/), and when that web page froze, I switched to [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/). If you have higher quality data to work with, then feel free to quibble with my exact numbers and dates. Either way, I don't believe the outcome will change much, and the analysis can still be useful in the future.",MauveTyranosaur69,40,8,0.79

40,Scam Warning: We have seen dozens of Arbitrum Airdrop scammers in the past few days,11vvp9z,"With many big crypto events, scammers will be trying to steal your money. With the announcement of Arbitrum's airdrop, scammers are hoping to capitalize on the complexity of crypto and users excited for free money.  Here's how this one works on reddit:

1. The scammers setup fake ""Arbitrum"" twitter profiles with links to fake Arbitrum websites or contract addresses. Most likely it requests access to your MetaMask and steals all your money.
2. They buy a bunch of reddit or twitter accounts
3. They spam crypto reddit with posts like the one below

Notice:

* The link text says it is going to the official arbitrum twitter account, but when you hover over the link it is going to a different account.
* If you click into the user's profile, you'll see their history is empty, has nothing to do with crypto, or they are spamming this link across many subreddits. It will look nothing like organic user activity.
* They are offering free money which appeals to people's greed and lowers their inhibitions.
* They may use deadlines or ""act now!"" language to create a sense of urgency, making you click the link before you think about if it is legitimate.

41,I’m a random degen crypto investor like the lot of you who got a taste of financial freedom.,11vvees,"Been in crypto since 2017 and got hooked by the tech (honestly). I knew it was revolutionary back then and not a single hair on my head that thinks otherwise today. Had my fair share of losses, exchanges getting hacked or just ran with all the cash (mf Firano), lost a lot of money in the process but my goal was clear and I suppose after the first bear my crypto-cherry got popped pretty quickly so it felt easy to lose money and deal with the crazy volatility after that. I honestly think that to make money in this game you really need to be a degen because I’m pretty sure “normal” people fold their cards way to fast due to the crazy volatility and 99% scams. As soon as I got passed the $100k unrealized profits with like $20k input my brain wanted to talk rational. Or should I say emotional because that’s what makes people sell. 


Anyhow, I just want to say thank you crypto for making this possible. I know there are more like me and to the people who want to make it you will be surprised where you will be 10 years from now.
I know it’s boasting but we are all anonymous so who cares? I can’t tell my family or friends about it and I don’t know why but I feel the need to tell you what crypto has made possible for me personally. 


You have been warned, it’s utter degen talk down below… :)


So here it goes…


First my goal was $100k, then it became $500k and now I’m aiming for $1mil.
Once I got passed $500k I already witnessed a bear so I knew to take profits, in the last bull run I got lucky with NFT’s and cashed out like $200k to keep in fiat, and wait for the bear to come. I still have like $80k in fiat (DCA’d quite a bit), close to $500k in BTC, ETH and other alts that I think will make it… and maybe XMR.


I guess after all the holding and believing and listening to people crypto has no future I said fuck it, time to realize some gains and give ourselves some nice treats. 


As a real gamer and tech savvy pretty much the first thing I bought once I reached life changing money ($500k milestone) was the best gaming PC possible, and a 4k beamer to stream them. Got some back issues so I bought myself a chair with those cool buttons that make you go “Aaaaaaaah”.
Sound systems in my house, got top tier gaming headsets and the best peripherals to go with gaming PC’s (racing seat and steering wheel, couch co-op keyboards, Hotas flight stick :D). PS5, got it… Switch, got it… Steam deck, fuck it… $4.5k gaming laptop for when I work abroad. IPad pro 3rd gen for banking and easy transport… new phone, new smartwatch for running. GF is into graphic design and was still rocking an old MAC, bought her the biggest one that was available because I love her and I can. 
4k 55 Oled TV screen that’s only as thick as my thumb… Rega Planar 3 record player because the old one was sub par. A freaking whole cabinet FILLED to the ceiling with cardboard games. Another closet with full series of comic strips. 
My garden is finally done, got us some real eyecatchers like the olive trees with the thick stems. Kamado Joe with all the accessoires, boy is that freaking awesome. $25k worth of bikes, indoor, Mountainbike and e-bike. 
Go on holidays, like the 5 star bring me cocktail ones…
My health has improved significantly because I can actually buy the best sportswear now, I feel less stressed because I feel like I’m doing OK and my family will also be fine. Overal happily throwing my money into a black hole again this bear market because holy shit has this been a ride.

Of course, it refers to the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath of a series of bank bailouts that followed.

As the age old saying goes, history doesn't necessarily repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. As of today, UBS has offered to buy Credit Suisse for approximately two billions dollars (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ubs-reportedly-reaches-deal-to-buy-credit-suisse-for-more-than-2-billion-8c9bd4d5). Had this deal not have gone through, the bank would have likely been nationalized. As you know, this is not the only problematic bank in this crisis, since multiple smaller banks have also been royally fucked this time - especially including SVB, the most relevant one for crypto.

People have always suffered, and will continue suffering, from the ""This time is different""-syndrome. Especially in financial crises, when times are good for a long enough time, people manage to forget what has happened before, and believe we have learnt from past mistakes. Thus, they shouldn't be repeated, except that they of course always are (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6372440-this-time-is-different). This is what partly constitutes into crises like these. 

The relevance of all of this for crypto is of course manifest: the original idea, or one of them of Bitcoin was to be your own bank. Even though this poses problems and by no means is a straightforward change, crypto must keep challenging the traditional practices and schemes. This revolution, if you will, is to make the game more fair for the common man, and we must HODL strong in times like these.

An acquaintance gave me a Discord invitation for a server called ""Elite Pump Group"" and said that you could easily and quickly make a lot of money there. I joined the server and there were a few people chatting and several channels of pics from the past pumps. A guy named Mickey Gold then announces which coin and time as well as a link to an exchange site a few hours before the pump begins. I then observed a pair of these pumps and thought to myself, if that's true, after 4 to 5 such pumps you'll be rich!
That's when I started with respect and the rule: If it sounds too good to be true, it is and won't work. Since you as a beginner also hear that everything is possible with Crypto, I was about to do it. I personally wrote to this Mickey Gold because it meant investing at least 700-800 to ask why so much. He then said something about exchange fees and you can otherwise have problems with the exchange, but 100 to 150 should be worth it.
Since I'm generally skeptical about such things, I started my research. This is how I finally ended up in this community and thanks to you all I was able to expand my knowledge.
Long story short, in the end I noticed that 90 to 95% of the users in this Discord channel were bots, this exchange (luxumbit was the name) site where the alleged pumps were taking place had only been online for 2 months.

53,Awaiting the Third Wave of Cryptocurrency...,11vr747,"Is the Third Wave of Crypto about to dawn?

First Wave - Cryptocurrency is born

The First Wave of BTC was the formulation and development in 2009 but Satoshi and his bros. I don't know if any of you were there then but it seems this was the primordial realm where great gainz were common yet insights and technicality were needed. Just as with placer mining for gold the easy-to-find deposits were just there for the taking. As word of mouth and tech-forum geekery wound down with the rise of social media and mining bountiful Bitcoin become harder, this ended with the coming of the second era in about 2013. So 4 to 5 years have elapsed at this point.

The Second Wave of Bitcoin - Cryptography comes of age

The Second Wave of BTC is what we are still in I would argue. It started when mainstream news began to comment on it, from memory my first recollection was Russia Today's Kaiser Report. The bandwagon was on the move as the curious, the opportunistic and the crazy came along. Yet unlike with Gold Rushes of the past, there was no real mainstream adoption as the technology had not become easy to adopt for the masses. Obtaining a bitcoin required escrowing money and mining it was daunting for the uninitiated.

Slow to get going, but it begins to gather pace. The price is now on the rise and fall similar to a trade-cycle but arguably more erratic and chaotic. With this 'Exploration' comes the slow-hand of regulation yet also adoption in various guises. Honduras and Salvador lead the way. American Cryptocurrency Exchanges become dominant. This age will end I would argue sometime this year, possibly by fall. By now nearly everyone has heard of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, but only a small, growing segment of the population has some. Obstacles such as CEX collapses and scams hamper momentum, but not as critically as first feared.

Ten years have elapsed since 2013 and as mining is now only the realm of the specialized ASIC miner, trade and holding are entrenched. The next and possibly decisive age awaits...

The Third Wave of Bitcoin - Mass Adoption

Over the next 15 - 20 years this is highly likely to gather pace. Generation Zoomer, whilst with less disposable income than Gen. Boomer and perhaps Gen. X, will be the final booster to the Crypto Rocket. Web3 and crypto storage may come into full fruition as a utility but possible difficulties include hyper-inflation and near-prohibition.

54,Has Crypto changed your outlook?,11vqkh4,"Hi all,

Has crypto changed your general outlook to finances, and also life in general?

For me I have seen more value in managing my own security and taking the reasonability into my own hands. Forced by my cold wallet and creating safe backups for those wallets. While there is a load more responsibility I find it comforting that the security is down to me. I have now moved away from cloud storage services in general and onto my own network attached storage. It is more work but having the responsibility mainly lie with myself and the data in my own possession has been oddly rewarding. 

I certainly do not have financial freedom. But I certainly have a heightened interest in my finances. After going through many complex transactions in crypto the idea of changing bank to a better interest rate or benefit is not  daunting at all. I feel much happier to put a little work in to benefit myself. I used to just leave everything as it was, couldn't be bothered.

Before doing it, we should have an emergency fund to have our ass covered just in case we lose our job, we have to pay medical bills, car/house appliance repairs, or maybe if the financial system collapse with the bank runs like we are in risk right now.

There is no specific amount of money that you have to have because that amount has to be according to your needs and situation. In my case, I only maintain the amount necessary to survive without work and paying all expenses for 4 months. To some it may seem little but in my case I consider that being a Software Developer the risk of losing my job and not finding another quickly is very low.

57,Buying Moons on Sushi Swap with Metamask: how to switch your ETH from the Ethereum Main Network to the Arbitrum Nova Network.,11vqbbo,"Today I successfully bought my first Moons through Sushi Swap. I wanted to do this for months, but after reading most posts on this subreddit there were some pieces of the puzzle missing. I was hesitant. When people talk about Sushi Swap it's easy to forget that Moons are on the Arbitrum Nova Blockchain, and the ETH you want to spend is living on the ETH Mainnet. 

The piece I'm talking about is that only once you connect your wallet (Metamask), you have the option to switch through the available chains in your Metamask wallet. Soon I realized that the ETH showing in the ETH Main Network was 0.00 on the Arbitrum Network. This is where [www.bridge.arbitrum.io](http://bridge.arbitrum.io) comes into play. Go to the site and, connect your wallet. The UI is super straightforward, select from: Mainnet (Layer1)  to: Arbitrum Nova (Layer2). Insert the amount you want to transfer, scroll down and click Move funds to. 

You will have to wait about 15 exciting minutes before the transfer succeeds, so grab a drink and a snack in the meantime. On the bridge website it will update itself and whend completed displays ""succeeded"" on the transaction. 

Now all you need to do is go back to [Sushi Swap](https://www.sushi.com/swap), select the Arbitrum Nova Network again, and Eureka! The default Sushi on the homepage had switched to WBTC, and if you search for MOONS they finally show up in the results. Confirm and exchange your ETH for those divine MOONS.

I'm sure there's more budget friendly options to buy MOONS besides with ETH, but I wanted to try Sushi for a long time. I hope this helps fellow beginners out with what should be a pretty generic operation in the world of crypto. 

In terms of fees I payed about about €3.5 in fees on a €50 Moon purchase, which isn't too bank breaking. 

Because I'm not used to trading, I started out with transferring €11€ worth of ETH (0.007 at the time of writing) to my Metamask wallet, to make sure it worked. I ended up receiving €3.33 in the correct wallet, making it an expensive test. But at least I was confident in transferring the next higher amount. I made sure to save the address of the transaction to avoid mistakes for further transactions. 

For my FOMO Budds: these are expensive times to buy MOONS. In no way I'm advising you to open sushi swap and try it right away. For me €50 Is a significant amount to spend on ""lucrative expenses"" like Moons,  on a monthly perspective. This was personally something I wanted to try for a long time, since the Arbitrum Nova Network. Without [www.bridge.arbitrum.io](http://bridge.io) and it's user friendly UI, this would have been a less smoother experience. 

To end of, Shitposting is still king, and that will be my main income of MOONS.I'm also here for the technology, so being able to do this from my couch was a wholesome experience. It is no very far from other payments systems that we already use. Which makes it even more exciting.",poeselkots,101,22,0.75
58,Bitcoin market dominance reaches almost 46%,11vq8ii," 

Bitcoin has reached new heights in terms of market dominance since June 2022 to reach almost 46% .

BTC's market share has increased after the coin surpassed $27,000 this week, marking its highest level since June. This is a significant increase compared to the two-month low below $20,000 two weeks ago, which was caused by broader risk aversion due to a series of US bank failures, including Silicon Valley and Silvergate, the two largest banks supporting cryptocurrencies and technology.

Although the sudden rise in BTC dominance could suggest a bullish run is underway, many market analysts remain cautious, predicting a slight correction before the final, notable and consistent bull run can begin.

Let's be honest though, crypto mass adoption is not happening anytime soon. Here are some reasons: 

* Nations or large institutions have no to reason to adopt crypto - In the end its all about **control** and they are not willing to give that up 

* Fiat rules the world - this is not changing anytime soon -

* Many people investing in crypto do it just because of the money - they couldn't care less about the revolutionary aspects of crypto (anecdotal point from the very few people that I have who actually own some crypto)

* In the public eye, crypto is often still considered a joke or a scam 
* Using crypto is way too complicated for most people 
* Active bitcoin addresses today were only at 1m

* Binance the largest trading platform by far “only” has 120m users

It is inevitable in a weak fiat-based financial system that crypto will win.

Bank runs are real and if one or two more banks fail we could start seeing a lack of faith in the financial system not seen in a long time.  So my question to this sub is if we are ready for the next financial crisis if it gets here in a week or a month? Are you comfortable that you and your loved ones have enough to survive if jobs are lost by the millions? Will your crypto, guns, food, land, generators and might be enough to get you by until something stabilizes. It just feels like things are going to break and it will be mostly us the little guys that will hurt. Have you saved enough? Do you have enough crypto? Do you believe crypto will be a viable alternative to get you by if your money is not available via your community bank? 

This is a big deal as small companies are already sweating this crisis. Many are deep in debt living of credit and loans plus the amount of debt they have vs unpaid bills, upcoming payroll and open account receivables not getting paid. And here lies one of the biggest problems for small businesses today. The amount of open account receivables not being paid is staggering across the board. Your employer better be on top of who owns them money and better start knocking on some doors because if not many of us will likely be out of a job. 

Remember. This is a game of trust, faith and confidence. Its all an illusion to make us believe this system works and for the most part it has but when it fails us it does so merciless and spares only the big whales. Us little guys absorb all the pain.

One thing I've learned the hard way:  the price of the things currently in your portfolio is largely irrelevant.  What is relevant is the price that you got when you sold, versus the price that you paid when you bought.   

Everything else in between is largely entertainment, .    

There is a lot of fluff being posted that is clearly appealing to base emotions, and a lot of emotional response.   Experience tells me that a froth is coming.  Could be upside froth, could be downside froth.  It's really hard to tell whether the powers behind it are positioning to exit into liquidity, or drawing in more interest to exit later. Could be more than one and could be both... froth is like that.  I am very concerned (given sanctions etc.) that we could have state or state-sponsored actors engaged here.  If that's the case, we're like frogs in a swimming pool with hippos, and that's a recipe to get flattened or sloshed far out onto dry land.  So while I'm with everyone else giddy at the expectation of rising prices, my Spidey sense is tingling. 

In the past, I've set profit targets, extracted profits, and then watched as what would-have-been in my portfolio rocketed up in price, and then rocketed right back down again.  It was hard at the time.  I didn't net as much as I could have, but I did net more than I would have.

I believe that, in addition to a general growing distrust towards the traditional banking system, the fact that USDC was able to go back to its 1usd value helped to start the push that we have seen in the last 10 days circa (and which pushed BTC to over 27k). And this is what actually made me ask to myself: ""what would have happened if USDC did not go back to its original value?""

In that case, we would have been in a very strange situation: on one side you have the shitty failing banks, while on the other side a major stablecoin not able to stay stable at all (I know that the trigger was the failing of the bank, but still fear for the market does not put any reasoning in the game). Such conditions would have triggered a major downtrend on both sides, with the risk of a really dangerous domino effect... At least this is my take on the topic.

70,Whelp. A random whale and degen just saved me from a max leverage liquidation,11voruo,"So ummm. We all know the saying: never go max leverage. Now me being me, I decided to do the opposite. It’s also say they say: do the opposite of this sub. This weekend was a real rollercoaster.

I had bought some NEO on Friday at very close to $13 dollars in two trades on max leverage, no biggie,  assuming the price would keeping going up due to bank crash aversion.

Actually, turns out, yes biggie. Very yes biggie! Woe was me when Friday night, prices started dropping. First it dropped to around $12.50. I said okay, I won’t sell. I believe in the trade. Something like that. Believe, conceive, achieve as Luke Rockhold would say. Then the next day on Saturday morning, prices started dropping LIKE A ROCK. See,during the late night/early morning, prices recovered to about $12.66, which was good. But Saturday was brutal. Shiz went from $12.66 all the way down to $11.78. I even got the Margin call email. But I had already gambled all my funds into one position so I had nothing left to put up for margin. But hope was still on the horizon as I wasn’t yet liquidated on any longs or even shorts, even though I still liquidated in my shorts.

My cheeks clapped around of applause at my stupidity the whole day into the night, especially as that night saw many mini-pumps and crashes that actually took the price even lower to $11.64, uncomfortably close to an all out liquidation. It was even harder to bear because I could have just sold at $12.96 or so but I was too greedy. Even when prices were still a ways above $12, I was still in a proper 50% loss. I remember seeing something like a 70% loss at some point, but I closed that screen so quick and told myself it wasn’t real. Did I mention the vast majority of my life savings was on this trade? The ~~hardest~~ most degenerate choices require the strongest wills.

Come to this morning prices were pretty poor still, still being mostly below $12 and me still close to liquidations. What was also playing on my mind was that there is even a liquidation fee, of maybe around 2%, so even if I was liquidated and left with 20%, I would then love 2%\* max leverage of that. But then my hope and belief paid off when suddenly some random degen, pushed the price all the way from seemingly just above $12 all the way to $12.94 baby! Man I, tapped out on that sell button so fast Conor McGregor would be proud. May have sprained a finger but I’ll bandage it with my dollar bill profits. I managed to make a 15% profit after all that. I even made a mistake selling around 10% of the position at 7% below the market price in the hype. All is definitely not well that ends well, I’m super tired and not at all satisfied with how things played out.

71,"If people ask me how bitcoin works, I have found a lot of success using this explanation. Feel free to use it yourself.",11vobdz,"1. First method is just don't do it. Don't bother. No seriously, Most of the time they don't care. They are just looking for an opportunity to sneer and make fun of you for buying magic beans. Tuipmania, blah blah blah. 
2. But if they actually are interested in how crypto works because they don't get it and want you to explain then this explanation has always worked for me. It's not perfect but it usually makes people understand *why* bitcoin has value without boring technical jargon:

Imagine you are tasked with creating a list. The list has to have some very special properties. Anybody can add to the list. But nobody can rearrange the list or delete an item off of it. It needs to be *decentralized*.

You might think to put the list on a website so that everybody has access to it. It's a good start but whoever owns the server on which the website resides could easily delete the list or alter it so this won't work. That's not decentralized.

So then you might think to distribute that website across millions of different servers with different owners. All the servers talk to each other to update the list when something is added and they all talk to each other to agree what the list is so if anybody tries to delete the list or alter it on their server, the rest of the servers will know and ignore their changes.

Great! problem solved!

But why would anyone be motivated to run one of these servers? What's in it for them? Well, you could pay them but if you ever stopped paying them you could essentially shut down the servers and delete the list. It's still centralized. 

What if the program paid them in its own made up money that it made out of thin air?....

That does solve the centralization problem. But why would anybody want fake money?

Well if there is a market need for a list with these properties and the only way this service can meet that need is if people get paid in the fake money then that fake money necessarily needs to take on value.

Ok, what's the market need? What does this list do that is so valuable?

It keeps track of who has how much of the fake money...

The market need is for a decentralized currency that is fairly distributed and decentralized. Thus the fake money takes on value because there is demand for the special properties associated with it by the list it runs on.

You say to the cashier you want to pay in cryptocurrency and their system shows them a selection:

They say they will add more crypto and BTC LN.

After selecting bitcoin and and continue (Continuar) it shows the amount in bitcoin

&#x200B;

[So that is, 0.00124813 BTC, yesterday it was very volatile so even when BTC was around 27,200 USD using that rate I paid around 34 USD. Not much sense there, 4 USD more I suspect it s a fixed fee, wouldn't make sense be 10&#37;.

After that it shows a QR code, you scan it and have to wait for at least one confirmation after you get one confirmation (mine took several minutes) the cashier press payment received and I suppose it checks one blockchain explorer for one confirmation or pending transaction that matches the amount. If it matches it says payment received and receipt is printed.

I noticed each time you press continuar a new QR code gets generated, so new or different address.

I used Trust Wallet and the fee was 1.36 USD.

Receipt is shown in Bolivares, but that is common here even if you pay with USD, Euros or any currency the invoice will be printed in Bolivares.

Experience was good overall, but in this case I paid a little more, something to improve.

You have to remember that here the economy is destroyed:

&#x200B;

* Monthly inflation can be over 10% easily. Being it under 10% is a success.
* Monthly minimum wage is 130 Bs. (less than 5 USD, this purchase was 5x monthly minimum wage), average monthly wage is 120 USD.
* Since 2007 14 zeroes were removed from the currency, so this 725 Bs would have been 72,500,000,000,000,000

Most people that were in the market in 2021 were thankful for the price drop in June of 2021 and bought thinking that was the best opportunity and we were right for that specific time. But when the dump of 2022 happened did you buy everything you could, or did you think it would go lower? 

Now that we're in a banking crisis and Bitcoin is doing what is was made to do are you buying or are you waiting for the next drop? We have seen a lot of articles saying we would be at 1 million dollars in 90 days, but who actually believes that? 

As we go higher in price action we will undoubtedly see FOMO start to set in and more retail investors return. The question is, how much are you investing? Are you going to continue your DCA or have you bought what you wanted and waiting for the next dump? If we hit 34k to fill the CME gap are you going to sell?

I hop on to their customer service and told them my deposits was not received and they told me, nothing can be seen from their end.

Obviously MOONS  mkt cap is smaller than the market cap of large  cryptos such as BTC and ETH, and I do not see MOONS approaching such mkt  cap values. But compared to other projects, MOONS has significant room  to go up. Especially since meme coins like SHIB and DOGE still have  massive market caps (6.5B & 10B respectively) and shady coins like  LUNC (0.8B) & hacked coins like ONE (0.28B) still hold market caps  10 to 20 times the size of MOONS.

Also  with the recent move of Reddit into the NFT market with its avatars, it  seems Reddit is betting on crypto and potentially will develop further  in this direction. Similarly, we saw GameStop enter the crypto/NFT  market in partnership with Immutable, of which the coins (IMX 1.3B &  LRC 0.47B)  also currently hold a significantly larger mkt cap compared  to MOONS. So if the MOONS ecosystem keeps developing and finds its way  to more applications (e.g. Reddits potential own NFT marketplace), I see  enough room for a further price increase.

79,I think I know how CBDCs will be introduced in the US and possibly other countries,11vmpng,"The primary issue we're facing now is that banks don't have liquidity because many banks messed up big time. Most of the banks have bonds and securities that aren't liquid, i.e., cannot be cashed out without a big loss (exactly why SVB failed). Some have calculated this loss and it's a huge percentage, which is why we're seeing the ""$1M BTC in 90 days"" prediction. It's predicated on the idea that almost everyone is insolvent, and the fed has no choice but to hand them free money, which would cause hyper-inflation.

In the case of a bank-run, most of these banks will fall. In addition to that, the problem is that if you give these bank bail-out money (like we're hearing now), they'll spend it recklessly and repeat the cycle invest without proper risk-management to make yield, like they always did... well, why wouldn't they? They have all the free money they want every time they fail.

But if you think about it, I think a CBDC will be the Fed's go-to solution to this problem. 

People don't do bank-runs to stash the cash under their mattress, but they do it just to guarantee that their cash is available when they need it. Combining this with the fact that the liquidity crisis/bank-runs is a psychological thing, all people need to know is that their deposits are safe. How do you do that without giving the banks any money? You simply tell the bank to screw off, and you tell the people that they can have accounts with the federal reserve that will give them access to their deposits. The bank(s) goes bankrupt, but the people will feel happy, thinking that they didn't really lose their money, which they can immediately use through a central bank.

The validators give back about 85% of their block rewards to their delegators, meaning the required security for the network is around 15%\*42m = 6.3m XTZ, a 7 TIMES REDUCTION!

The idea is to emit the amount of rewards based on the amount staked in the network, hence the proposal called ""adaptive inflation"".

Please set realistic goals for yourself.,11vlyv9,"Just a heads up to anyone who expects to get rich by investing small amounts of money... Bottom line, it's not realistic. Big reward is almost always tied to big risk.

And that's not to say investing small isn't a good reason to invest! If you have 20 dollars in your pocket that you'd like to see grow, then in all honesty - crypto is probably the best way to see larger future returns over any other method....

&#x200B;

Hell I got into this game because investing in the stock market was a bit too difficult and overwhelming to get started. Not to mention that in most cases, you need thousands of dollars to open a securities account... With crypto, you don't need to have a large amount of capital to dip your toes, which made it extremely attractive to me.

That said, make sure that you're not buying into low cap shit coins in the hopes that maybe one day it'll moon-shot to BTC's price...

Put 50 dollars in here and there, whenever you can afford to invest more. This ensures that you're not reliant on the funds you're investing, while at the same time keeping your risk low, and growing your portfolio in the log term.

85,The Bull Trap: How to Spot It and Protect Your Crypto Portfolio 🐂🔥,11vks5h,"Hey guys, it's an exciting time in the crypto market right now with prices soaring to new all-time highs. However, it's important to be aware of the possibility of a bull trap.

A bull trap is when the market appears to be in a strong uptrend, but then suddenly reverses course and begins to decline. This can be devastating for those who were caught off guard and invested heavily during the bull run.

Here are some tips for spotting a bull trap and protecting your crypto portfolio:

1. Don't chase FOMO: When prices are skyrocketing, it's easy to get caught up in the hype and start investing heavily. However, this can be a trap. Instead, focus on the long-term fundamentals of the project and make sure you're investing based on sound principles.
2. Look for signs of a top: Watch for signs that the market may be reaching a top. This could include extreme price volatility, overbought indicators, or a sudden influx of new investors.
3. Take profits: If you've already made significant gains during the bull run, consider taking some profits off the table. This will protect your portfolio in case of a sudden downturn.
4. Diversify: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different projects and asset classes. This will help to minimize your risk and protect your portfolio in case one project performs poorly.
5. Have a plan: Make sure you have a solid investment plan in place and stick to it. Don't make hasty decisions based on emotion or hype.

Remember, the crypto market is inherently volatile and unpredictable.

Lido allows Ethereum holders to stake their ETH in exchange for stETH, a separate derivative token that can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, borrowed, or used as collateral for loans on DeFi protocols.

87,You can store your seed phrase online and be safe if you know what you are doing.,11vkgse,"We keep hearing that you have to always keep your seed phrase offline.

If you know what you are doing you can easily keep your seed phrase online as long as it's not a simple text file or some sort of note-taking app that can be accessed by anyone.

All you have to do is just write that seed phrase in a document, and encrypt the file with a very strong password. Then you can rar it or zip it again protecting it with another password. Just don't make it obvious like your date of birth lol. 

Then Load it up on some sort of cloud storage and you are good to go. Make sure to also have 2FA in your cloud storage account too (not SMS one). Don't name the file anything obvious for the hackers

Now your seed phrase is securely stored online. And before anyone says ""uhh but it's online"" yes, yes it is. But it literally takes hundreds of years to brute force a strong password with a supercomputer. You can store your seed online and have multiple backups even on your phone if you are not a complete idiot.

To get hacked like that hacker needs to:

1. find out what your email is for the cloud storage account, 
2. this means they'll need to target you specifically (highly unlikely, remember that most ""hacks"" aren't hacks, it's usually people willingly entering their seed phrase on fake websites),
3. they will need to find out your password to your online cloud storage,
4. even if you have a virus on your computer and your email and password got keylogger and sent to hackers they still need to go through the following steps,
5. they will need to hack your 2FA (good luck with that),
6. find the file and it will be hard if you have multiple files in there, especially if it's named something like ""holiday\_photos.rar"", don't just write ""MY SEED PHRASE"",
7. they will need to crack the password for the rar or zip archive first,
8. they will then have to crack that file's password which will take years to brute force it (good luck with that)

There are multiple layers of security that need to be compromised. And you'll need to be targeted specifically for that to happen. Even if you have a virus on your computer it doesn't really matter as their vector of attack is completely different, viruses will usually swap your copied address to a hacker's address etc. it's a totally different attack type.

TLDR: You can store your seed phrase online and on devices connected to the internet if you are not a complete donkey. All you have to memorise is your encrypted file's password.",rootpl,127,0,0.35

 I think the best way I can think of is to get a cheap metal engraver from Harbor Frieght, and take small credit card sized pieces of metal you can cut out from a sheet/piece that you can get at a hardware store. Use the engraver and put your seed phrase on multiple metal cards and keep them in multiple safe locations. 

Also wet concrete indoors in an unnoticeable location if you’re pouring a fresh slab in your garage or basement. Find a location on an end that no one would ever think to look, and while the concrete is still not cured, and in between dry and wet and write it in with a fine point object. If it ever flooded or had a fire, in theory you should still be able to access it. And if you ever moved, just take a grinder took with a sandpaper disc and carefully remove the seed phrase from the concrete so the next owner can’t see it.

If you live in an apartment or a city, the metal engraving would probably be the safest bet. It doesn’t really stink or anything when etching metal like it’d be for wood.

After some months the gov resolution came and all the remaining depositors losted 50% or more of their deposits 

After this event, people losted confidence in our banks, they started saving money in their houses with USD cash, sending money to other countries banks, buying property, anything you can think of instead of leaving the money inside our banks. BUT, some small % always remained in local banks because all of us needs to pay expenses, buy groceries, movie tickets, taxes, etc... and credit/debit cards are still very usefull. What we understood is that even big institutions can fail and that the government will help us till certain point, that we need to take precautions by our own hands and diversify elsewhere.

In 2021 several fintech projects linked with crypto debit cards starrted poping up, you can deposit cryptos and use them with your card (Stables or big ones like BTC, ETH, and a few more). The biggest one called Lemon in April Last year it passed the 1million users and cards, just in 1 year it catched 2%+ of our population. Today i think if we gather all these fintechs apps it must be around 5%+ of the population.

tldr: If the international banking crisis happen, banks will be hit but they wont die as they are a key part of society. Instead they will end up losing part of their share in the payments system to newer options (crypto).",heyheoy,23,6,0.87
92,Another way of writing down your seed phrases,11vjfo0,"When you create a new wallet, you are always asked to write down your seed phrase. With that experience, when you see somewhere a list of 12 or 24 words, you automatically think this is a seed phrase someone lost or shared by mistake.

Using basic encryption, you can protect your seed phrase from \*\*some\*\* bad actors. Keep in mind that basic encryption doesn't guarantee your seed phrase is safe. However, it may help filter out those who are inexperienced.

The seed phrase is a set of 12 or 24 words from the BIP39 word list. The list is standardized and consists of 2048 unique words, meaning each word has its own index in the list, e.g. abandon = 1, choice = 322, etc. The full word list can be found here: [https://privacypros.io/bip39-word-list/](https://privacypros.io/bip39-word-list/)

If you replace your seed phrases with those numbers, you can introduce a layer of security.

Example seed phrase:

    timber sword where noodle joy eagle admit tuna vibrant museum gossip river

Result:

    1810 1763 2003 1201 965 553 30 1876 1948 1166 808 1495

For the person without experience, it will be quite hard to grasp what that list is and how to use it. This could be improved even further e.g. by merging the list into a huge single number that would make no sense to even more bad actors. However, it would also mean that we would have problems decrypting it because we wouldn't know where the current index ends and the new one starts. As I mentioned above, the list of words is standardized (it won't change), so it is safe to assume that each word from the list is identified by a maximum of 4 digits, and indexes with less digits could be converted to 4 by simply prepending 0 to them. So index 1 becomes 0001, index 64 becomes 0064, and index 986 becomes 0986. Given the same seed phrase, the result would look like this:

    1810 1763 2003 1201 0965 0553 0030 1876 1948 1166 0808 1495

And then you can write down the encrypted phrase as:

    181017632003120109650553003018761948116608081495

If you would like to give it a try, please make sure you can decrypt the phrase before ditching the list of the words you have. Just repeat the instructions in reverse order.

93,Which countries do you think this year will adopt Bitcoin as a Legal tender?,11vj4w4,"We all know that El Salvador and the Central African Republic (CAR) have already adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender. Out of these two El Salvador has shown significant improvement in their economy. They recently shared with the world that they have paid back $800m sovereign debt. Every mainstream media outlets controlled or financed by the big financial institution were against them when they adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender.

Till last year almost every mainstream media outlet had predicted that they would default on their $800m sovereign debt but that did not happen and now many other countries that are presently going through an economic crisis would be interested follow on their footpath. Do you then think that other countries would adopt Bitcoin? If yes, then which country would likely do it this year?

As for me, I think this small country Tonga islands might adopt Bitcoin. They have already shown interest in Bitcoin as they would like to mine it using the green energy which BTW, they have in abundance and another reason is that the population in Tonga is not that big for large energy consumption. They are interested in training and providing Bitcoin mining equipment to every resident in their country where the population is just 106,858.",No_Concentrate2892,89,11,0.68
94,Any security experts that can provide guidance on questions about wallet security?,11visa2,"I'm increasingly growing paranoid about how safe my crypto assets are, with all the news and stories about wallets being hacked or drained due to malicious contracts. 

So I'm hoping to get some insight and perhaps even expert guidance from the sub.

Let's say I have a Metamask account, and within that account I have two wallets. One is a normal wallet, while the other wallet is one that's secured by a Ledger. 

For the first wallet, I use it actively to interact with DeFi contracts. I can't keep track on where it's been (and its been to weird places). The second rarely if ever interacts with any contract - its also the one holding a lions share of my NFT assets.

My questions are: 

1. If I signed a malicious contract with the first wallet and it has a command that allows it unrestricted access to that wallet, can it also see and access my other, Ledger secured wallet?

2. How secure is the other wallet secured by my Ledger? So far I've only used it to receive NFTs and signed interactions with OS and Blur (which I've since revoked via revoke.cash) 

3. As far as I can remember, the second wallet is an imported one from my Ledger device (it says Ledger in the list when I click the circle icon top right of MM) so the seed phrase should still be in the Ledger but... any other way  can be sure it's a Ledger account and not a MM wallet ported into the Ledger instead?

Sorry for the long winded questions. I need to make very sure because of all the stories of funds being taken even when the wallet was secured by a Ledger. 

And I also hope this might help everyone else in the sub... security may be an individual responsibility, but a community is vital to empowering individuals to strategically secure their stuff.",yuruseiii,35,6,0.8

But beware of the euphoria. BTC to one million in three months is absurd and looks alot like the crazy talk we heard about BTC going to 100k by 2021. In the past, we have seen smart money using retail as exit liquidity in those periods.

Since we don't know where the market is going, a cautious approach is better. This means to keep DCAing like nothing changed, not going all in to allow us to take advantage of downs in the market, not leveraging our positions even if greed temps us to do so and not chasing gains by switching project everytime the market moves.

But will they? Do we really need any chains besides ETH? I could Imagine BTC will always be dominant where ETH serves for further usecases.

ETH is upgradeable so it can change with the market, while BTC has the potential to be solid and strong. So I read some stuff about these coins but I can't see a reason why we would really need them? They have their upsides like scalability and interoperability. But while ETH is evolving what do they offer to replace ETH and/or BTC one day? 

I could see them surviving in their niche and it would be good for the competition. A downside is that too many different tokens complicate the market for investors and users. But why should I invest in them? I really don't see them rising to take over the market.

So, here are some creative ideas to keep your seed phrase safe and sound:

Use a funny phrase or a song to help you remember it. For instance, ""My dog ate my homework on a rainy day"" could remind you of the first part. 

Consider getting a tattoo of your seed phrase as a permanent reminder. Just make sure to find a reputable tattoo artist who won't mess up the accuracy, and maybe tweak a word or two so they can't steal it for themselves.

Embed your seed phrase in a piece of art by writing it in invisible ink and revealing it with a UV light. That's some James Bond-level stuff right there.

99,Nexo - Last Man Standing,11vhfmc,"This isn't a post to dig deep and spread fud. I am simply overwhelmed by how strong Nexo has been in spite of everything during this tough bear market alongside all of the bad news on a global financial scale.

Nexo has long been regarded as a rather sketchy lending platform and came under extremely heavy scrutiny at around the time of the Celsius as people were fleeing lending platforms en-masse as trust was shattered and people feared losing their funds

One instance of bad news which I personally didn't believe that Nexo would overcome was a raid on their offices earlier this year. However this seemed to turn out just fine for Nexo (in the short term at least) and in rebuttal, Nexo said that they would be suing the Bulgarian government because of their actions, calling them “shameful” and was preparing to file a lawsuit against the government seeking damages. During this time, Nexo saw a huge wave of withdrawals make their way out of their lending platform yet they weathered the storm and are still here today, seemingly being left rather unscathed by the entire experience.

A second rather large case for Nexo recently has been their battle with the SEC in America. Now, nobody is ever surprised when the SEC stick their nose into crypto and try to shake the foundations but this time they got a bite and Nexo agreed to pay a total of $45 million to US regulators to settle claims that it failed to register the sale of its Earn Interest Product (EIP). This is a HUGE sum of money to be shelling out at a time of great uncertainty yet Nexo are still here, remaining somewhat unshaken.

These few points are but a drop in the ocean for Nexo as a company and I'm sure that a lot of people here have more tales to tell regarding the company and more opinions to share which I would love to hear so please, fire away!

102,Another clarification about Balaji's $1mn bet,11vgtmu,"I made a post earlier today titled ""Clarification about Balaji's $1mn bet (misinformation)"" where I was making a point that his $1mn bet was against hyperinflation of dollar and not $1mn btc price in 90 days; all of this based on all his visible tweets which I had linked to. Even though many others on the sub said otherwise, I thought so since no one around spoke of what and where he said until u/angry_koala_26 quoted his $1mn bet terms. 

It so happens that he linked one of his tweets to a longer post which is as follows:

Here are the remaining references, as Twitter has a limit on the number of links in one post.

I am moving $2M into USDC for the bet. I will do it with Medlock and one other person, sufficient to prove the point. See my next tweet. Everyone else should just go buy Bitcoin, as it'll be much cheaper for you than locking one up for 90 days.

Terms of the bet: ideally someone can set up a smart contract where BTC is worth >$1M in 90 days, then I win. If it's worth less than $1M in 90 days, then the counterparty gets the $1M in USD.

HYPERBITCOINIZATION We have to define hyperinflation in BTC vs USD terms because all other fiat currencies can and will be inflated away. That is hyperbitcoinization.

This is the moment that the world redenominates on Bitcoin as digital gold, returning to a model much like before the 20th century. What's going to happen is that individuals, then firms, then large funds will buy Bitcoin. Then sovereigns like El Salvador (@nayibbukele) and tiny crypto friendly countries.

The big move will be when a US state like Florida or Texas, or a ""normal"" country like Estonia, Singapore, Saudi, Hungary, or UAE buys BItcoin. And when @narendramodi tells India's central bank to buy Bitcoin, even as a hedge, it's over.

Why will it be so fast? Well, hyperinflation happens fast. We've seen digital pandemics (COVID), digital riots (BLM), and digital bank runs (SVB). Everything will happen very fast once people check what I'm saying and see that the Federal Reserve has lied about how much money there is in the banks. All dollar holders get destroyed.

The thing is, people are still tuned to an analog world where things get gradually worse rather than all at once. But there isn't much forewarning for a digital event — it's 1 and then it's 0. Just like the bank runs, except this is the central bank.

There are however two sources of forewarning. First is the chart of the long-term depreciation of USD vs BTC, from less than $1 USD per BTC to $25k USD per BTC. Much of the smart money has been voting against the dollar since the financial crisis. The end is a digital drop off a cliff, almost invisible on the chart — but highly visible in the world.

This tweet is the second forewarning. It'll be ignored and mocked by people who still trust the US establishment, even after the last few years. Who can't imagine that the US banks and media could be lying to them to this extent.

But they are. Just as they did in 2008, and over the last ten years. The digital devaluation of the dollar is coming and it's going to be intense.

#ends here, a few of my thoughts hereafter


As much as I have no clue about what btc's monetary valuation would be against usd due to events we've never seen before, I tend to think that his reasoning and references citing them hold valid. I'm surely rooting for the outlook of the current financial and political systems he has as I think of it similarly.

One aspect I tend to differ a bit about is the source of dollar's devaluation. I'm not sure if I differ exactly, since I'm not sure of what he thinks of this issue. It's about the nature of bubbles in general across decades/generations. If we look at the history of bubbles, the only common thing that sparks them is when drastic growth picks up in both the economy and one or more other aspects that tend to dominate most personal and social behavior.

The two most commonly know bubbles from the recent times are the dot com bubble and the housing bubble, both in the US. I don't think many people around the world know or atleast talk about Japan's real estate and stock market bubble of the 1980s. The general opinion both in media and general public is that Japan has a fairly sound monetary system. No one talks about or reacts as much to rate cuts or hike happening there even though it's the world's third largest economy, accounting for almost 8.6% of global GDP. All the messes we know of are from the US which is effectively spreading waves across the world via whatever happens with the dollar like we felt in the global recession. Just the housing bubble there due to a banking and valuation fraud sent the dollar spinning in the air and all nations feeling the effects since they use it as a reserve currency and partially where the own currency derives value from. And as a result, if all of them inflate against each other even in small proportions over long periods of time (decades), we can clearly sense something might go wrong with the notion of money if the US screws up somewhere. Especially in how it's been managing its $.

With the two recent banking collapses in the US, we saw how the government panicked and announced that they effectively fully insure all deposits. But only for these two banks though. It's beyond the mandate of FDIC and the secretary Jannet Yellen stepped in because she sensed ""systemic risk"" to the financial infrastructure of the economy. Econ words for ""oh shit, stop that else the banking sector is gonna trip and fall."" There's a reason they're scared. It's because everything been lent in multiples both to the world (both corporations and foreign governments) and itself. And all that the banks are supposed to keep as reserve are with the FED where they get exchanged for treasuries where the government effectively take that for a fixed period and use it for whatever they wish. One of the things it does with that is lend and fund the functioning of multilateral institutions like the IMF. It pretty much gets that to perform its duty as a government where it's also been using that to exercise power over the world and one of its biggest forms is the military spending. Pretty much what the general international consensus is for what backs the strength of dollar - that it can control and surf through the world events. No wonder they've been involved with every major war of the last century. Anyways, I'm rambling all of this to make the point of credit bubble. That a lot more is being spent that what can be afforded for whatever real value there is to back it - the real economy (!monetary economy). What those US economists won't be allowed to call a disequilibrium.

Everyone would know from econ 101 that wherever there's disequilibrium, the side that's inflated has to revert. It's scary to say it but it literally translates to 'the dollar has to crash to represent what the real American economy can actually afford.' There are many Americans on our sub, it'd be interesting to hear if you can bare the cost of every other diplomatic engagement around the world - military, financial (debt) and health are those big chunks. If the citizens can't, the government's gotta be crazy. It pulls out funds for this both from taxes and as well as fed backdoor. The whole world also takes their word for granted for if they're accounting everything right and not in alignment with their incentives. What could go wrong I guess lol?

If the banks start losing value of the stock market like they already have, people will slowly but surely start pulling out. Would you keep your money in if the bank is losing over 10% its market value in a week? Or even a month? Forget it, even a quarter? It guess that's where time is to tell what's to unfold.

Also wanted to stand corrected over the terms of bet where he's literally betting a lot to go down in the next 90 days including btc @$1mn. Interesting bet for sure despite being degen at best for just making a point🤷‍♂️",noob_zarathustra,69,7,0.61
103,Created my own Indicator Set as a means for discipline,11vg38r,"In short:

Due to my lack of discipline and my gambling behavior, I am trying to create my own technical indicators to teach myself to not FOMO but to wait for the right signals. I am quite proud of the outcome and I want to share my positive feeling about it as well as the script itself.

I know it is not perfect and I still tend to overtrade.. but I try to see it as part of the learning curve to understand what strategy works best. And the need to have PATIENCE!

I am now working on a stragety script based on the ""TIRF"" to combine these signals in a meaningful way.

It turned into quite a joyfull hobby, experimenting with pine script. It is much easier then I first thought. I started after watching some interesting guides on youtube how they used ChatGPT to create ""insanly profitable"" strategies, which after backtesting myself is hughly overexagerated... But regardless I tried it myself. And to be honest ChatGPT really sucks in scripting consistently, I only use it as an assistent and actually write most on my own now.

I hope this script may be helpful to others as well. I am always interested to get some feedback on how to improve it. I try to explain the main aspects in the TradingView post as well as comments inside the script.

But it’s really just not that simple. If you are holding your coins in a wallet, cold storage or not sure your coins can’t be taken. But it can be hacked and stolen or lost with no keys. 

In banking your money is relatively safe but if the bank goes under or you make an incorrect transfer your money is insured and protected.

In the world of exchanges for crypto it was a little of both. People will treat an exchange balance as a wallet and if it’s hacked and it’s a big exchange you should be covered. But FTX and Celsius have showed us this is not an option because people who companies that aren’t regulated can’t be trusted. And neither can banks who constantly gamble your funds.

The more I learn about this, the more I realize that if the long-term theses of Bitcoin and Etherium will likely take several decades to play out (if they actually do - this is still a risky investment). The majority of people who achieve life-changing wealth will be those who:

* Gradually accumulate blue-chips.
* Prioritize their emergency fund so that if something happens they don't need to sell their crypto.
* Prioritize security (storing assets in cold storage and appropriately managing their seed phrase) and be vigilant of scams so they don't lose their crypto.
* Avoid selling on emotion just because they are deep in the red.
* Continue to hold while the media tells them Bitcoin is dead (again)
* Continue to hold while their family and friends, who they made the mistake of telling, ask them about crypto and laugh at them following a bear market.

We will start families and watch our children grow up. We will move house and have to be careful to not lose our seed phrase. Adoption will take place and Bitcoin will keep ticking while our bodies age and the world changes around us. There will be scams, controversies, and short-lived fads. There may be years on end where the Bitcoin price stays flat or even slowly decreases. For all the highs, there will be a lot of nothing while we gradually DCA in and that hardware wallet sits in the draw untouched. It will be exciting. It will be boring. It will be brutal.

109,Keeping your crypto secure is nobody's job but yours. Here's how to do it.,11vdyok,"I've seen a few posts recently about people either losing their seed phrase, or an unauthorized user gaining access to their seed phrase. Here is my method for keeping my seed phrase secure:

First, you need a Ledger. If you're not keeping self-custody of your coins, you're missing the point of crypto. Crypto was born out of the distrust of banking and traditional financial systems after the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bailout. If you're letting a bank or exchange have custody of your crypto, you're giving away all of the unique properties of crypto that give it so much potential and value. Get a Ledger.

Next, your ledger will have a 24-word seed phrase. Obviously, this phrase should never be entered into any digital device, period. It should be written down on paper, in pencil (ink from a pen will run if it gets wet).

BUT, what if someone breaks into your house and steals the piece of paper with your seed phrase written on it? What if your house burns down? These concerns (and others) are why you *don't write your entire seed phrase on one piece of paper. You write parts of your seed phrase on three separate pieces of paper.* Here's what you do:

* Paper slip #1 = words 1-16
* Paper slip #2 = words 9-24
* Paper slip #3 = words 1-8 and 17-24

Now, the complete seed phrase is readable with *any two* of these pieces. So for example, if paper #1 burns up in a fire, you can recreate it with the data written on papers #2 and #3. If paper #3 is stolen, the thief only has 16 of your 24 words. They will not be able to gain access to your wallet with only 16 words.

You might ask, ""what if all three pieces are stolen, or burn up in a fire?"" *That's why you keep all three pieces in different locations.* I keep my Paper #1 stored safely on my property. Papers #2 and #3 I've given to two different people whom I trust with my life. They keep the paper I gave to each of them in their own secure locations.

If one of the papers is ever lost or destroyed, I can simply rebuild it using the other two papers. The two people I gave the papers to also know who has the other paper, so even if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, they could get together and recover my crypto, and figure out what to do with it. It wouldn't be lost forever just because I've been smooshed by a bus.

True, the other two people could conspire against me and recreate my seed phrase using the papers I gave them and steal my crypto. *That's why you need to give them to people that you TRUST.* Not only trust in terms that you don't think they would rip you off, but also trustworthy in the sense that you trust them to store your paper responsibly and not lose it.

Before I started investing in crypto, I researched all this stuff. To me, crypto was never going to ""go mainstream"" if a flood, theft, or fire could wipe out someone's entire holdings. I wasn't interested in crypto unless I could solve the problem of redundant and secure self-custody. To me, this ""three-paper strategy"" solves the issue of secure self-custody reliably enough that I'm confident that my crypto is as safe as the fiat in my bank (maybe moreso).

Don't lose your hard-earned money because of lazy security practices. Crypto is for the big kids. There's nobody babysitting your crypto and making sure bad people don't take it. There's nobody keeping track of it to make sure you don't lose it. You need to take responsibility for your own crypto, and the three-paper strategy is a great way to achieve that.",neocamel,78,22,0.69
110,Layer ∞,11vdujp,"In the year 2027, it's been two years since the introduction of the Layer ∞ scaling solution. Back then, everyone was excited about the prospect of faster and cheaper transactions on the blockchain. But what happened since then?

Well, it turns out that Layer ∞ wasn't the magic bullet everyone thought it would be. In fact, it's caused more problems than it's solved. The new protocol has led to a uncountable number of layers & bridges between them, each with their own unique tokens and fees. It's gotten so complicated that even the most experienced blockchain developers are scratching their heads.

Not only that, but the Layer ∞ ecosystem has become a breeding ground for scams and rug pulls, its turned into scam-warfare with scam and counter scam destroying the throughput of whole layers. It seems like every week there's a new project promising to revolutionize the space, only to disappear with investors' funds a few days later.

111,I think I know the reason to the recent pumping. (Last 3ish days).,11vd690,"As we all noticed, BTC went to town recently, and Ive seen so many people asking why, and I think I might know. 

Before we begin, this is my opinion, thank you for reading, and I’d love to see your opinion. Well let’s begin!

#START

A few weeks ago, busd was in some poopoo and since it’s a stablecoin, the price stays the same. So whether the marketcap is 1 billion or 100 billion, it’s the same/near price. 

Basically around 3-5 billion dollars worth of busd was taken out, and there’s a good chance most people panic sold it and just dumped it into BTC. And went back to sleep, thus the spike in BTC while the busd drama was happening. 

#MIDDLE

Exact thing happened to USDC, it lost a mc of 7.5 billion dollars, (I switched to usd recently, so this number might be a little off). 

Where would that money go to? BTC, and then fomo kicks in, and it goes up. That’s why in 2 days it went up 15-20%. 

#END

TDLR: Stablecoin loses mc, money gets dumped in BTC, and market goes up.",Only1Shock,114,6,0.55
112,"We may never get ""hyper-inflation"" but we certainly have ""hyper-desperation"" for a bull run, right now!",11vbl4g,"Many of you may have seen Balaji's (ex. Coinbase exec) new drama on Twitter, projecting $1M price for Bitcoin in 90 days (Sounds insane? It does) and placing a $2M bet on that. A whole bunch of ""influencers"" and ""whales"" on Twitter are going gaga over that and creating all sorts of theories, touts and perspectives. For example, one said Balaji was right about Covid so he will be right about Bitcoin price signal. 

I see this as a **hyper-desperation among EVERYONE for a bull run**. A VC friend told me that most Venture Capital firms (especially in Silicon valley) are so deeply burnt with 2021-2022 Crypto melt-down that they are desperately want to just exit to market with invested sum, forget returns. Their LPs are behind them and have been hammering for a while. I am not saying we are not desperate, we would like a bull run as much as anyone but it's amusing to see this desperation from folks across the spectrum.

This puts market in a very strange position. There is a little bit of hope for better economic outlook than what most expected towards the end of last year but we are still dealing with the same old issues - war, inflation, FED's tightening, geopolitical tension etc. etc.

So hard to say where we are headed in this extreme desperation even from people who seemed to have some self-esteem, who are now openly shilling. But, somehow, I don't have good feelings, especially for retail investors. It's sad that what Crypto (Bitcoin) was born to fight (a few intermediaries/ centralized figures exploiting the masses) has become an issue for Crypto.

122,A (hopium-filled) theory.,11v74hm,"So, I've been thinking about crypto a lot recently, and here's what I think.

A lot of the people I know who are very much into crypto have the same story: It's not about the politics or technicality of it: most of them have the same story, they got curious about it a few years back, bought a bit of it, and saw their holdings multiply in value 10x or more. And poof, they were hooked. They're now into it for the long haul.

I think that's at least one mechanism through which (long-term) adoption happens: people get some out of curiosity, or out of necessity (need to buy ""something"" with crypto), the market goes through one of its frequent ""explosive growth"" phases, and that's enough to strongly convince them to use it as a store of wealth.

In the past few years, use of crypto in the ""developing"" world has exploded. People use it to send/receive money from abroad (the market Western Union used to have a near-monopoly on), and they also use it when their country's currency is shit (which is the case in a lot of countries) seeing too much inflation. 

Now, I was thinking: at some point, we're going to go through another of these huge growth phases (People talk about the 2024 BTC halving as the next big one. Even if it's not then, it'll be at some point. Maybe). 

When that happens, a lot of people in the developing world who are holding small sums of crypto, are going to see their holdings explode.

Matias who's working at a hotel in Belgium sends money each month back to his auntie Sofia back in Uruguay. Sofia hasn't spent everything she's got last month, and it starts growing in value, and growing and growing...

I think if this happens to many millions of people around the world, you're going to see many of them starting to accumulate crypto (even if small amounts at a time), in hope that the same thing will happen again. And that could become a new massive motor for the market/for crypto in general.

127,Binance's respondes to US regulators... sort of.,11v5ynl," 

Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has recently come under scrutiny from US regulators and politicians. A group of US senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, sent a letter to Binance on March 2nd, requesting financial data and raising concerns about the exchange's activities. The senators claimed that Binance and its American arm attempted to evade US regulators, evade sanctions, and facilitated the laundering of at least $10 billion.

Binance responded to the letter with a 14-page document emphasizing the exchange's compliance efforts and recognizing past mistakes. Binance's chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillman, noted in the letter that the exchange has built solid Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering policies in recent years and leverages both internal tools and tools from established third-party vendors to scan user transactions and profiles in real time. Hillman also stated that between August 2021 and November 2022, Binance stopped over 54,000 transactions as a result of transaction monitoring alerts.

Despite Binance's emphasis on compliance, the exchange's response failed to address the senators' concerns about transparency. The senators had claimed that ""what little information about Binance’s finances is available to the public suggests that the exchange is a hotbed of illegal financial activity.""

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a probe into Binance.US in February regarding trading firms alleged to be connected to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. An investigative report has suggested that Binance was behind a transfer of roughly $400 million in funds from a Binance.US account to a trading firm managed by Zhao. The exchange has also faced regulatory scrutiny in other countries, including the UK and Japan.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are difficult to regulate due to the nature of cryptocurrencies, which are susceptible to being used for illegal activities, such as money laundering. Binance is clearly trying to comply with regulations, but it is operating in a murky and difficult space. The exchange has made mistakes in the past, which is not surprising given the complexity of the regulatory environment it operates in.

The situation with Binance highlights the challenges faced by regulators in the cryptocurrency space. The lack of transparency and anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies make it difficult to track illegal activities. While some countries, such as Japan and the UK, have taken a proactive approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, many others are struggling to keep up with the pace of innovation in the space.

It remains to be seen whether Binance will be able to satisfy the senators' requests or whether they will face further regulatory action. One thing is certain, however, the world of cryptocurrency is never dull, and the challenges faced by regulators in this space are likely to continue for some time.

128,"Deeper Network's crypto miner: a $130 ""free VPN for life"" that requires payment to use",11v5nno,"The Deeper network promises a magical product: For the low price of $130 to [$200](https://www.amazon.com/Deeper-Connect-Pico-Unlimited-Protection/dp/B09TFY1HBZ) or [more](https://www.amazon.com/Deeper-Connect-Mini-Protection-7-25length/dp/B09G27H7HQ), you can get a device that connects you to their network, and it's totally free after that payment. Or so they say. *They* won't charge you, they tell you.

Even better, because the network only uses devices connected in people's homes, this means you can access services like Netflix and Hulu, services that traditionally block commercial VPNs. It's much harder to block a VPN coming from legitimate residential addresses.

Deeper promises you this network of other nodes that will be available to you *for free and forever*, and in exchange for sharing your internet connection, you will get paid. But wait a minute. How will you get paid by other people who are using your node, if they don't have to pay to use it?

## ""Payments of DPR to use""

The Deeper CMO [addresses](https://youtube.com/watch?v=J-aSuNYmTlk&t=5m32s) this:

> So in order to use... **there's very little micro payments**, which is **payments of DPR to use**, but once we're reach a certain amount of nodes, **in order to use DPN you have to have small payments of DPR.** So if for instance Lou I'm using your node and you have bandwidth, you have great bandwidth, you set it at a price, and it's at 1/100th of VPNs cost, I connect to it, **I have to pay you some DPR**, and because you're sharing it with me you *earn* the DPR. **That's the marketplace.**

## ""Stopping users from only using""

Deeper's customer support goes even [deeper into depth](https://deepernetwork.cc/d/842-does-it-cost-dpr-token-to-access-vpn-from-pico-or-mini/2), explaining how users must forfeit some of their cryptocurrency to use it.

>**Once you use 50 MB** of data through a specific node a channel... **reserves 1 DPR** and lasts for 48 hours... This 1 DPR is pledged temporarily with the remaining portion returned to you after 7 days.
>
>...If i connect to 10 nodes and use 50MB's on each of them, **10 DPR would be temporarily locked for 7 days**, after which i would receive back 9.9995 DPR 10...
>
>This system encourages users to offer higher amounts of bandwidth while **stopping users from only using and not sharing**.

## Deeper seems be faking their network

Looking into reviews for the products, you will notice people complaining that IP addresses being used to do not belong to residential nodes. One user complains they connect to [DigitalOcean nodes](https://np.reddit.com/r/DeeperNetwork/comments/ux76i4/not_enough_nodes_too_early_in_the_game/), and [another user](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/review/B09G27H7HQ/R1D1ZKM7HKHQKO/) found their connection being rooted through AWS and Cloudflare nodes. 

This might just be speculation on my part, but if I was a company trying to make it look like my decentralized VPN was better than it really was, I might buy some $5 a month DigitalOcean nodes and set up my VPN on it, maybe grab a few from Amazon too, etc. When the hardware costs $130 minimum, it seems the price is inflated to account for a few months of extra VPN access for the people purchasing it. 

Many other reviews note the absolute garbage service, the lack of IP addresses, the slowness of network connections, etc. The device itself appears to not be made as a VPN at all, but rather a last resort for people who are trying to access blocked content... And if that's the case, trying to access streaming services like Netflix would be absolutely disastrous.

## A closed-source black box

To add insult to injury, the Deeper boxes are running some closed source operating system. Nobody knows what's inside of it, and as long as that is the case, I guess they can keep on pumping out expensive hardware. Their Unbox Therapy promo video contains a comment mentioning their CMO'ss promise to release the source code, but I can't find any video evidence of that ever happening.

# ETA: part 2

## The ""decentralized"" product is centralized

[In a single tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/helloericma/status/1635533786871119873), the CEO/CMO Eric Ma revealed he was able to shut down staking across every Deeper product. 

## It's totally secure... But download the security update

>There was recently **a FALSE report** of a security breach of AtomOS. Be assured your data and network is 100% secure...

>**We are, however, taking further measures** to further strengthen AtomOS so misunderstandings like this do not occur again.

From all the proponents of the deeper software, confusion is the top takeaway I've gotten from them. 

* Sometimes, I am told (by reading official sources) that using the DPN cost money.
* Unofficial sources tell me that the DPN is totally free for life for current users.
* Other people tell me that the official sources are talking about an app that doesn't exist, and that *it* will cost DPN... And that the official sources were talking about the *app* when somebody asked about the device.
* *Other* unofficial sources tell me that the information I have is outdated, but can't point to any updated documentation.

Long story short, the only common thread between all the sources I've seen here is that the official website and the official administrators are not to be trusted. And **for a project with closed source software, not being able to trust anybody is a huge red flag**.",lo________________ol,58,7,0.68

I have decided to put my savings into crypto. I am not doing this as an attempt to get rich quick. My main goal is to store my savings and hopefully see some gradual increase in value. Which crypto would you choose? I would have thought Bitcoin as it is too big to fail but perhaps there is a better option out there? Please let me know. I don’t want a diverse portfolio within crypto. Just keep it simple and pick one horse. Thanks.,ABloodHen,146,0,0.38

The unreal levels of inflation he is hoping for. It seems completely crazy, a situation that will likely result in utter chaos.

But then as an owner of large amounts of Bitcoin is it in his interest to say this 

Does Balaji Srinivasan as a billionaire deserve no more time than the next person? I'm inclined not say yes, don't really need anymore attention seeking billionaires do we?

133,What changes will you make to your investment strategy for the upcoming Crypto Bullrun based on your past mistakes?,11v2sl1," It's hard to predict whether the recent rally marks the beginning of the next Bullrun or if it's just a temporary fluctuation. In fact, no one can say for certain what the future holds. However, it's reasonable to expect that the Bullrun will eventually arrive and lead us to new heights. We should keep a watchful eye on market trends and stay informed to make the best investment decisions.

With that being said I wonder and want to ask you: 

 What specific mistakes did you make during the previous crypto Bullrun that led to losses or reduced profits, and how do you plan to modify your investment strategy to increase profits and minimize risks during the upcoming Bullrun?

The subs has taught me BTC is an alternative to a nation's monetary system (fiat issuing body) with a fixed sum used to measure value. While ETH is a multifaceted ecosystem with layer 2s and sidechains. More like a super computer with endless applications and ways to be utilized.

I explained the usual pro-crypto stance and then he absolutely went on one. “Crypto is too volatile” “the bubble will burst” “it’s speculative” bla bla bla. He was saying this in a passive aggressive tone and I’m not one to argue or debate so just shrugged my shoulders and said “we’ll see, won’t we”.

Now suddenly, every new project at work this guy is being really off with me (I’ve worked with him on a few projects before and he’s been great). Not sure if it’s personal or just a deep hatred for the space, I don’t care to be honest.

during the last Bull run there were some posts about how cool it would be, if you could be paid in crypto for your jobs.
Some people suggested they would like to be paid 100 % in crypto or maybe atleast 50 / 50 .
Than came the bear.

137,Bitcoin as a protection against failing banks? Thoughts?,11v226t,"With recent bank failures causing concern among depositors, many may look to alternative investments such as Bitcoin. But is investing in Bitcoin really a safer alternative than keeping money in the bank? In this post, I would like to explore why investing in Bitcoin may be a safer option for those worried about the security of their money while it sits in a 'safe' bank account.

First and foremost, traditional bank accounts are vulnerable to a range of risks that can lead to insolvency. Banks can fail due to bad loans, market fluctuations, or economic downturns. This can result in significant losses for depositors, particularly those with large sums of money in the bank. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not tied to any financial institution or government. It is a decentralized currency that operates on a global network of computers. This means that it is not subject to the same risks as traditional banks and is not vulnerable to bank failures.

Secondly, investing in Bitcoin may offer greater security than traditional bank accounts. Bitcoin transactions are secured by complex algorithms and cryptography, which makes it difficult for hackers to steal or manipulate the currency. In contrast, traditional bank accounts are vulnerable to cyber attacks and other forms of fraud, which can result in the loss of funds.

Thirdly, Bitcoin offers greater privacy than traditional bank accounts. Traditional banks are required to comply with a range of regulations designed to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities. This means that banks may monitor and report on their customers' financial transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is designed to be anonymous and untraceable. This means that users can conduct transactions without fear of being monitored or tracked. I understand that KYC has its disadvantages due to government regulation (at least in the US), but it is important to realize that the banking system has more information about their clients than a crypto exchange ever would (spending habbit, direct deposits, etc.)

Finally, Bitcoin may offer greater potential for long-term growth than traditional bank accounts. While the value of traditional currencies is subject to inflation and other factors that can erode its value over time, Bitcoin has shown remarkable growth even during bear cycles. While there have been periods of volatility and price drops, the overall trend for Bitcoin has been upward.

However, it is important to note that investing in Bitcoin is not without risk. The value of Bitcoin is subject to market fluctuations and is notoriously volatile. This means that investors must be prepared to weather periods of sharp price drops and uncertainty. Additionally, the regulatory environment surrounding Bitcoin is still uncertain, and there is a risk that governments may take steps to regulate or even ban the use of cryptocurrencies.

In conclusion, investing in Bitcoin may offer a safer alternative to traditional bank accounts in the face of recent bank failures. Bitcoin is not tied to any financial institution and is designed to be resistant to inflation, cyber attacks, and fraud. It also offers greater privacy and potential for long-term growth than traditional bank accounts. However, investing in Bitcoin is not without risk and investors must carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks before making any investment decisions.

Ultimately, the decision to invest in Bitcoin should be based on an individual's risk tolerance and investment goals. Those looking for a safe haven for their money may find Bitcoin to be a more attractive option than traditional bank accounts. But for others, the risks associated with Bitcoin may outweigh the potential benefits. It is important to conduct thorough research and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions.

Edit: A fellow redditor made the comment that I did not completely lead this discussion where I intended it to go. I pretty much think that large institutions can benefit from investing their money in crypto rather than having it in liquid bank accounts where a bank may fail at any moment (the past two weeks have been rough for the financial world and that does not appear to be ending anytime soon).

138,Elon Musk vs Cramer: unstoppable dickhead vs immovable knobface. Who best to inverse?,11v216d,"Elon Musk recently tweeted a sarcastic comment regarding Jim Cramer’s recent market predictions. The host of CNBC’s financial TV show “Mad Money” has given guidance to investors numerous times, but often that advice has turned out to be wrong. Recently, he argued that people should use the recent crypto price rally as an opportunity to sell their stash. The South African entrepreneur ironically supported the “Inverse Cramer” strategy – a plan that helps investors bet against the stock picks of “Mad Money’s” host. The Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (ticker SJIM) was designed to perform in the opposite direction of the TV personality’s advice. Some cryptocurrency participants have recently claimed that betting against Cramer could be an appropriate investment strategy since his predictions on the future performance of digital currencies, such as bitcoin, have not been quite precise.

139,Do you ever foresee BTC and ETH becoming fully mainstreamed and banks being a thing of the past?,11v1yqx,"It’s always crossed my mind. Is this the next logical progression for the monetary system. Are people responsible enough? Is being in charge of our own financial freedom a good thing for the masses? 

I’ve worked in customer facing roles and I’ve seen how ‘dumb’ some people are. Will their be a brick and mortar BTC house, like a bank but without the executives. 

And most importantly when $1 is in the bank, it remains $1 until we do something with it like spending. Are the general population ready to handle the swings? 

Will BTC be fully incorporated into our daily lives and not just a reserve asset that isn’t tied to fiat. Im writing this in a subreddit for crypto. So I know I might get some flack, but these questions are all important if we are to understand where we are going. 

Is BTC still considered the gold standard or is it outdated and not built for mass scalability.

140,How long do you think Bitcoin’s pump will last?,11v1yax,"The devastation of three crypto-linked banks (Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank & Silvergate Bank) has nothing on Bitcoin. Indeed, the blue chip of crypto is growing from strength to strength these days. People were pleasantly surprised when it held above $25k. Now, they are exhilarated that Bitcoin has surged past $27k as they seriously contemplate whether this increase represents a bull trap or a bull run.
Economist Alex Kruger even tweeted “Long Bitcoin, short the bankers”. 

Reasons that could explain the rise in Bitcoin include investors realising that it might not be the best idea to park their money in stablecoins - given USDC’s woes - and swapping them for Bitcoin, Binance converting its crypto industry recovery fund from BUSD to Bitcoin, and even traditional markets expecting interest rate hikes to be lower. Of course, no one knows exactly but it’s fun to speculate the likely reasons.

Similarly, do you think Bitcoin’s current pump will be short-lived, as adrenaline-pumping it may be? And that we will witness prices below $20k again sooner rather than later? Or are you of the opinion that it has broken past the resistance level and will henceforth start crabbing at say, $24-25k?",cryotosensei,54,3,0.6
141,The high risks of crypto investments: Tales of fortune and failure,11v1r40,"When it comes to investing in speculative assets which a lot of coins are atm, important to remember that it's not all hookers cocaine and lambos. It's tempting to get caught up in the hype and the potential rewards, it's crucial to approach these investments with caution and do your research. Don't let survivorship bias distort your view of the risks and rewards. Remember that for every investor who makes a fortune, there are many others who lose money or are unable to cash out. Be realistic about the risks and potential downsides before making any investment decisions.

ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings): During the height of the ICO boom in 2017, many new tokens were launched with promises of revolutionary technology and high returns. Some of these projects did indeed succeed and made their early investors significant profits, but many others failed or turned out to be scams. However, because only the successful ICOs are typically reported in the media and discussed in online forums, there is a survivorship bias in the perception of ICOs as a whole.

Altcoins: Similar to ICOs, many altcoins (i.e. alternative cryptocurrencies) are launched with promises of innovation and high returns. However, because Bitcoin and a few other high-profile cryptocurrencies have seen tremendous success, there is a tendency to view altcoins through a survivorship bias lens. This can lead investors to overestimate the potential success of a new altcoin and underestimate the risks.

Hodling: ""Hodling"" is a term used in the crypto community to describe the practice of holding onto a cryptocurrency long-term, even during market downturns. While hodling can be a successful strategy for some investors, there is a survivorship bias in the perception of hodling as a universally profitable approach. This bias overlooks the many investors who have lost money by hodling through prolonged market downturns or investing in a cryptocurrency that ultimately failed.

Overall, it's important to be aware of survivorship bias when investing in crypto or any other asset. Remember to look at the whole picture, including both the successes and the failures, and consider the risks and potential downsides before making any investment decisions.

144,Let’s talk about Plutus,11uznm8,"I have been a user of Plutus. For those of you who don’t know, their main USP is a debit Visa with a cashback function in crypto. It - for me, I’m in the Eurozone - worked like this: I transfer EUR via SEPA, can transfer them onto the card, pay with the card and get cashback in their token, PLU. These tokens are locked for 45 days (I’m not really a fan of this policy, but that alone isn’t that terrible yet), after which I can sell them, on their platform, for EUR to top up my card. So far, so good.

Now, in recent weeks, they started to do improvements on their platform, as they claim. This involved that they suddenly removed the ability to exchange your PLU back for EUR… until July! This is assuming they keep that timeline, which time will tell.

I therefore asked how I am supposed to access my PLU funds in the next three months. They referred me to their option of withdrawal to a wallet, which I honestly cannot tell if it works, because it doesn’t work for me since they impose a 5.63 PLU minimum. This is a cashback platform, many users don’t have that much.

If it worked as they claim, again I can’t try it, it would only work once a week (on Thursday I believe), would cost around 3 EUR in gas fees, after which I would have PLU in a wallet, with follow-up fees to transfer it to a CEX and swap for hard crypto like ETH or BTC or potentially fiat.

I expressed my dissatisfaction with this situation, noting that these kinds of decisions appear like red flags to me, after which mods in their sub started deleting my comments in their official support thread for spreading FUD. All I was asking for was a way for accessing my funds. That’s really poor support, in my view.

I am not saying they are not legit, but practices like this are something that doesn’t increase my confidence. 

Time will tell, but I would urge some caution in doing business with them. We all had experiences with platforms that seemed good and then collapsed, and nobody saw any warning signs.

For me, the warning signs here are them suddenly disabling their main method of selling their token for three full months, only giving the reason they are working on improvements, imposing a minimum amount for withdrawal, and their horrible interaction and censorship of criticism in their official support thread. 

Alright, I tried to make this as fair as possible, I don’t want to spread unnecessary doubts, but also inform others about possibly unsound business practices.",yldf,14,0,0.44

146,Exploring the Underlying Values of Blockchain Technology,11uz9qw,"Blockchain technology is often associated with technical and financial innovations, but it also has important implications when it comes to societal and personal values, that are worth exploring. Values, whether they are externally imposed or self imposed, refer to principles or guidelines that help us guide our choices and actions, with the goal of living a meaningful and coherent life. If we hope for blockchain and cryptocurrencies to revolutionize our financial and social systems, we must give more importance to the underlying philosophy of this movement. In this post, we will explore how blockchain technology intersects with the (overlapping) values of trust, authenticity, decentralization, permanence, justice, self-responsibility, and community.

**Trust and Transparency**

Trust is a fundamental value that involves a belief in the reliability, integrity, and honesty of others. Blockchain technology promotes trust by enabling transparent and secure transactions that are verified and validated by a decentralized network of participants. Unlike traditional centralized systems that rely on intermediaries such as banks or governments, blockchain networks are designed to be transparent, decentralized, and trustless. This means that participants can interact directly with each other, without the need for intermediaries, and trust that the transactions are authentic and secure. Besides peer-to-peer financial transactions, blockchain technology can be used to verify the authenticity or ethical status of products, such as organic food or luxury goods, by tracking their origin, production, and distribution through a tamper-proof and transparent ledger **\[1\]**. Blockchain technology can also be used to create digital identities, such as passports or licenses, that are verifiable and secure, without the need for centralized authorities **\[2\]**.

**Authenticity**

Authenticity is another important value related to the functioning of blockchains. Authenticity involves being true to oneself, expressing one's unique identity, and seeking genuine connections with others. Blockchain technology enables authenticity by providing an immutable ledger that ensures the integrity and verifiability of digital assets and transactions. The immutable ledger ensures that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, thus ensuring the authenticity of the data. For example, blockchain technology can be used to create digital art or media that is authenticated and verified, enabling artists to sell and protect their creations in a secure and transparent way (NFTs, Reddit Avatars **\[3\]** etc). Blockchain technology can also be used to create self-sovereign identities, where individuals have control over their own personal data and can share it in a verifiable and secure manner **\[4\]**.

**Decentralization**

Decentralization is a value that involves empowering individuals, promoting self-organization, and respecting individual agency and autonomy. Blockchain technology promotes decentralization by enabling a distributed network of participants to validate and verify transactions, without the need for centralized authorities. This decentralized network ensures that no single entity has control over the network, thus ensuring its resilience and independence. For example, blockchain technology is a foundational aspect of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications **\[5\]** that enable users to interact directly with each other, without the need for banks or other intermediaries. Decentralized networks can also be used to create social networks that are owned and controlled by their users, rather than by centralized corporations, reducing the risk of algorithmic bias and censorship **\[6\]**.

**Permanence**

Permanence involves seeking a sense of continuity, stability, and meaning in life. Blockchain technology aligns with this spiritual value by providing an immutable and permanent record of transactions that cannot be altered or deleted. This ensures that the data recorded on the blockchain is permanent and cannot be lost, modified or erased. Blockchain technology can be used to create permanent and transparent records of land ownership, reducing the risk of disputes and fraud. It can also be used to create permanent records of medical records, enabling patients to control their own data and share it with healthcare providers in a secure and verifiable way **\[7\]**. As we will discuss bellow, permanence, paired with transparency, is a central force in reducing corruption and tracking down criminal activities.

**Justice**

Justice, as we know, involves promoting fairness, equity, and respect for human rights. Blockchain technology promotes justice by enabling transparent and decentralized systems that ensure equal access and opportunity for all participants. Blockchain technology also promotes accountability, by providing an auditable and verifiable record of transactions that can be used to hold individuals and organizations accountable. A potential application of blockchain technology in this direction is in the creation of transparent, pseudonymous and accountable voting systems **\[8\]**, reducing the risk of electoral fraud and ensuring that every vote is counted accurately. The nature of the blockchain favors justice when it comes to crime by providing a clear and permanent ledger on which to track down transactions related to crimes **\[9\]**, whether it be payments, funding, laundering or theft. No one can hide on the blockchain. In a more preventive vision and as discussed in the beginning of this post, blockchain technology can also be used to create decentralized supply chains that ensure fair labor practices and ethical sourcing of materials.

**Self-Responsibility**

Self-responsibility is probably one of the heaviest values related to blockchain technology. Blockchain networks are designed to enable individuals to take control of their own data, assets, and identities. This promotes self-sovereignty, self-determination, and self-responsibility, which are important values for personal growth and spiritual development. By providing individuals with secure and verifiable digital identities, blockchain technology enables them to participate in digital ecosystems without having to rely on centralized authorities or intermediaries. This requires individuals to take responsibility for their own digital footprint, privacy **\[10\]**, and security **\[11\]**. By promoting self-responsibility and permanence of data, blockchain technology can encourage individuals to take ownership of their own lives and become more engaged and proactive members of their communities.

**Community**

Community is another value that is closely tied to blockchain technology. Blockchain networks are designed to be decentralized and open, which enables the creation of new communities and the strengthening of existing ones. Blockchain technology creates new opportunities for people to connect with each other, share their ideas and values, and collaborate on projects that align with their spiritual and social goals. For example, blockchain technology can be used to create community-driven platforms for crowdfunding, where members can support each other's projects and initiatives **\[12\]**, as well as community tokens to reward meaningful contributions to communities **\[13\]**. Blockchain technology can also be used to create decentralized marketplaces that enable small businesses and entrepreneurs to connect with their customers directly, without the need for intermediaries. By promoting community building and collaboration, blockchain technology can contribute to the growth and development of more vibrant and constructive communities **\[14\]**.

**Conclusion**

By promoting trust, authenticity, decentralization, permanence, justice, self-responsibility and community, blockchain technology has the potential to contribute to a more conscious, just, and interconnected society. As we continue to explore the potential of blockchain technology, it is important to remember that its ethical implications are just as important as its technical and financial innovations. By integrating conscious and ethical values into our technological innovations and encouraging open and insightful dialogue, we can create a more balanced and meaningful future for ourselves and for future generations.

\~

**TLDR: Blockchain technology promotes the values of trust, authenticity, decentralization, permanence, justice, self-reasonability, and community; a set of values that can help us move towards a more conscious financial system and world.**

According to Bloomberg sources, Coinbase has informed its institutional clients of its intention to create a new trading platform abroad. Due to a strict regulatory environment, the United States is making it difficult for cryptocurrency companies to conduct business.

The community believes that the US is missing out on cryptocurrency innovation due to its tough stance.

# Coinbase is planning diversification abroad. 

The exchange wants to create an alternative location independent of the main Coinbase market. Emilie Choi, the Chief Operating Officer, said:

>""International expansion will continue to be a significant part of our business.""

There is no confirmation yet regarding the location of the new platform, but countries such as the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, and Hong Kong, which are racing to become cryptocurrency hubs, are potential candidates.

Earlier, BeInCrypto reported that Coinbase intends to expand internationally within the next eight weeks and will start with Singapore.

Coinbase wrote in its letter to investors for the fourth quarter: 

>""It is disappointing that regulatory bodies do not necessarily support transparency and public participation in rule-making. Especially agencies in the United States present an inconsistent position towards cryptocurrencies, which pushes the industry overseas.""

# Continuing the fight against cryptocurrencies in the United States

As cryptocurrency-friendly banks such as Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Silvergate Bank fall, new obstacles emerge for Web3 industry firms. Regulators have reportedly demanded that banks bidding on Signature Bank ""give up the entire cryptocurrency business.""

Some state officials blame cryptocurrencies for the decline of banks.

151,[SERIOUS] Do you think the crypto market will keep recovering as it is now? More in description.,11uxqas,"During and after the events related to the Silicon Valley Bank, we've seen the crypto market improve and it's begun to rally in the past few days. The ignition might have been people panic-selling USDC for BTC and ETH, but the growth has been sustained after that.  
I am however worried for the mid-term future:  
\- inflation is still high (both in the US and in the EU) and has kept eaten away at people's purchasing power and savings (I'm talking 10% to 100% increases in the price of all goods, from food to furniture - where I live milk is 30% more expensive than last October, meat is 20% more expensive than 1 year ago, some kinds of home furniture are **60%** more expensive and so on)  
\- despite the above, the rate hikes will seemingly continue for the foreseeable future despite there being no excessive spending to stop; JPow has gleefully commented on how the job market is still ""very tight"", meaning more or less ""we can hike the rates some more, we can afford to have more unemployed people around""  
\- salaries for a lot of professions are NOT keeping up with inflation, and since there already is no overspend to correct with rate hikes I would expect to see even less spending in the future, with people retreating into just spending the bare minimum  
\- the tech sector, which crypto is fairly strongly tied to, has been experiencing regular layoffs since circa the start of the year and it doesn't look like it's stopping anytime soon

With this rather bleak picture as the background, is it really possible for crypto to stay at the current prices, or even recover further?

152,Arguments countering the environmental concerns of Bitcoin,11ux4wh,"I’ve had a few encounters where the environmental concerns of Bitcoin was used as an argument against using Bitcoin and over time I’ve come up with a few counterpoints. Especially now with SVB big in news and some news outlets attempting to use it as a blow against Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency. However, I figured I post my counter arguments in the r/Cryptocurrency hive mind to help improve my arguments for Bitcoin or point out any flaws in my reasonings. 

Some of them are direct responses and some are a bit left-field. 

Direct responses to concerns of Bitcoin using the same amount of energy as entire countries. 

1. The massive energy consumption of the Bitcoin network is by design as a security feature. This means that any rogue entity wishing to hack the Bitcoin network will need to utilise massive energy resources in order to affect the blockchain; this ties in to the security of the network. Other Layer 2 alternatives are much less energy consumptive. 

2. Bitcoin’s energy usage is opportunistic and can in theory be entirely run on renewable energy and is increasingly being done so. It is up to governments to subsidise renewable energy programs and make these cheaper than non-renewable sources.

The following is a bit more left field, and not sure how strong it would make for an argument. 

3. current major fiat currencies also have a carbon footprint associated with them on top of just the equipment needed to run the servers to process transactions, but also in the value major floating currencies have in relation to each other. The value of a major currency against another on a floating foreign exchange market is determined by speculators making bets for or against how well a country is doing economically, usually against the US dollar as the global currency, the value of which is largely tied to oil sales. The economic output of a country itself heavily relies on energy consumption to function. Obviously if Bitcoin was used as a national currency then this argument wouldn’t hold anymore.

* I bought $100 of BTC, and received 0.00468369 BTC, which at the time of purchase, was worth $95.37.  $4.63 of my initial $100, gone.
* When I transferred to my ledger wallet, I paid a fee of .0002 BTC, which at the time was equivalent to $5.48. 
* So I spent $100 to end up with $89.89 of BTC in my Ledger wallet.

Algorand was slightly less terrible, mostly due to (much) cheaper network fees. I spent $100 to add $95.46 worth of ALGO to my Ledger.

So 10.11% of my BTC purchase went to fees, and 4.63% for ALGO. Both of those fees are unacceptable if you ask me.

So needless to say, I did NOT find a cheaper way to buy crypto than CoinBase Advanced Trader. Does anyone have any suggestions for the cheapest way to put BTC and ALGO into my Ledger? Is there any way to just buy the coin directly into my Ledger wallet, and that way avoid one of the transfer fees?",neocamel,21,0,0.36
155,"The so-feared and “first-ever“ Death Cross, had exactly no influence on the markets and Bitcoin and that was actually pretty predictable.",11uwu2f,"One very popular Technical Analysis here on this sub is probably the Golden Cross for some reason which is probably a mix of memes and simplicity of it. The Golden Cross basically means that the 50 day Moving Average crosses the 200 day Moving Average, meaning that the short-timeframe upward volatility is over the long-timeframe one and thus its often seen as bullish.

The opposite of that is the Death Cross, which is usually the 200 daily Moving Average crossing the 50 daily Moving Average from the upside. And here already the scrutiny around the latest “first-ever death cross“ hype begins:

Golden Cross and Death Cross are officially just used on the daily charts but the past days some tried to use it on the weekly charts showing that we have a first ever Death Cross there. This is not how it works.

We can also see from this chart that on the first glimpse it seemed like the Death Cross is actually playing out but in reality it was just the early uncertainty around he banking collapse which we all know instead resulted in a rally as of now to even $27k.

This is the trick about TA, sometimes it actually makes sense and many many of the other times we just simply use it in a wrong or “unknown“ way. TA is not here to give you the exact path forward but is just a good guide and on top of that you have to use it in the right way, things like changing the time-frame may already make it invalid.",partymsl,30,7,0.65

You don't only calculate ATH base on the last price but rather the marketcap. One example, a coin that went over hyper inflation during the last bull

GRT ATH: 2.4$

market cap: 2.8B

GRT now: 0.16$

market cap: 1.3B

Meaning that if we to get back to the ATH the mcp would need to be 19.5B, meaning that the amount of money to reach that price will be **A LOT HIGHER**. Sorry for the people who are holding GRT at those prices, probably will never break even

**Coins have inflation, remember that when researching a project.**

Some coins have 2.5% other 10% or even 100%, if you compare only the price you are in for a bad time when you realize that that **easy x20 is just a x3**.

Anyways, ETH is deflationary right now, BTC has low inflation, **other coins too so comparing the price there isn't a bad indicator**, but in other cases like GRT is a different story

Investors are in rejoice as Bitcoin price marked a whopping surge of 35% over the past 7 days. As the Bitcoin price rally continues, the Former Coinbase CTO is expecting Bitcoin to reach $1 million in the next 90 days.

Ex-Coinbase CTO Bets Bitcoin To Reach $1 Mln

Balaji S. Srinivasan, former CTO of Coinbase crypto exchange is betting with “James Medlock” a reported neoliberal over Bitcoin price to breach the enormous $1 million figure. However, Isaac Haxton, American professional poker player decided to jump in to grab the opportunity.

Haxton in a tweet stated that he can send one Bitcoin to escrow on the behalf of James Medlock if he is donating 70% to GiveDirectly. However, the Poker player added that he’ll take all of the downsides if Medlock loses and none of the upsides if he wins.

To this Ex Coinbase CTO reacted that they can do it via smart contract, however, escrow will also work. He mentioned that the rules that the escrow person would need one BTC address and one Ethereum address, while the assets would stay on-chain for 90 days.

Balaji mentioned that if Bitcoin stays less than 1 million in 90 days after the bet, then Haxton will win and get to keep one BTC and $1 million in USDC. However, if Bitcoin price breaches $1 million in 90 days then Ex Coinbase CTO will get both Bitcoin and $1 million USDC.

166,"Don't go out there hunting for airdrops, you'd be much better getting them spontaneously",11uv7sh,"I have spent a long time during summer 2021 doing various tasks to qualify for different airdrops, and I totally regret it now. Not only did I spend so much time tweeting and liking stuff on Twitter to earn nothing in the end, I actually exposed my wallet to the danger of hacks by interacting with various contracts, especially those from new crypto projects. 

Airdrops are a rabbithole that sucks your soul even more than crypto does. And in the end, it really depends on your luck(some have a secret criteria, and some give airdrops to some lucky participant, etc).

On the other hand, you can make money from airdrops just by being a regular defi user and using new blockchains when they launch. Not only does that allow you to learn more about the project and make better investment decisions, but it allows you to make money from some random airdrop.

Personally, I'm pretty sure I'm illegible for the Arbitrum airdrop, and I didn't really aim for it, instead I became illegible by tipping fellow users here and recieving the monthly airdrops in this sub. Add to that, I used the Arbitrum network to safe-custody my ETH( I can't really afford to use the mainnet, even though it is better for safekeeping).

What about you fellow redditors, do you think crypto airdrops are worth it? And if so, did you make a decent income participating in them?",Sylerb,47,2,0.58
167,If the United States fell into an economic civil war,11uv5b5,"How do you believe it would effect the crypto markets.

I asked our good friend chatgpt and this is the generic response generated.

""An economic civil war between the blue and red states in the USA would have significant repercussions not just for the country, but for the global economy. The crypto market, in particular, would be impacted as investors would become increasingly risk-averse and seek to safeguard their assets. This could lead to a decline in crypto prices as investors move to more traditional safe-haven assets. Additionally, such a conflict would create a highly unstable economic environment that would be difficult for any market to navigate. It's essential to note that such a scenario is unlikely, and the best course of action is for all parties to work towards finding common ground and implementing policies that benefit the country as a whole.""

Hopefully we can do better here to predict the implications.

*Lol, that Balaji post triggered me I gotta say. He went full on CIVIL WAR. But if they just stopped cooperating economically outright, who knows. If some states started dropping the USD because of hyperinflation caused by the fed. Maybe Miamicoin(yes its a scam) was the canary in the coal mine.",Trokariloz,26,0,0.39
168,Betting on Crypto,11uv4f5,"Besides DeFi, I see sports betting in the crypto space as a huge opportunity.  With the global sports betting market worth almost $84 billion and  growing at almost 10% annually, it's no surprise that more and more  providers are entering the space. 

&#x200B;

Has anyone experience in the crypto field and can answer me some questions?

* Is there a side which accepts moons as a deposit?
* What types of sports and events are available to bet on? 
* Is it also possible to bet on the outcome of elections?
* Are there any promotions or bonuses available to customers who use cryptocurrency to bet on sports?

169,March Madness of Crypto,11uv0ih,"Like many Americans, I usually watch several games from March Madness every year. For non-Americans, it's a 64-team college basketball tournament that is single elimination. I also typically fill out a bracket of how I think things are going to shake out. This post is just proposing that r/CryptoCurrency hosts a Cryptocurrency March Madness bracket next year. We could fill the spots with the top 64 coins by Market cap and then let users make brackets and track who wins. 

How does it help? I think it will help market and grow the sub. People like these types of competitions overall, which is why we see so many companies marketing around the bracket. Even Starbucks NFT journey this month is modeled around this,. I think it would drive user activity and create a new source of fun in this sub. 

Also, there could be a prize for the winner to motivate more people to sign up and participate...MOONS perhaps?

We obviously are already too late this year, but something to at least start thinking about for 2024.

170,"One of the most positive trends in Crypto: Shrimp, Crab and Fish holders are holding more coins, while more manipulative holders like Whales and Exchanges are holding fewer coins.",11uuyix,"When it comes to Crypto as a market it is often about who drives the prices the most, or in on-chain metrics it would mean who holds the most supply and thus has the most manipulation-power on the markets. It usually was, and is still, very clear who is in that position: Whales and other large holders like mining companies and exchanges.

But this trend seems to be changing over tome, especially this bear market there seems to be a very big shift of power from the bigger holders to the smaller ones, you for the basic understanding here are the definitions of the different holding groups:

* Shrimps, under 1BTC
* Crabs, 1 to 10BTC
* Fish, 50 to 100BTC

\-Sharks,500 to 1k BTC

* Whales, 1k to 5k Bitcoin

(Obviously there are more but those are the important ones for this post)

Here we can see the new Yearly Absorption rates which are calculated by dividing the supply the group holds through the total circulating supply of Bitcoin. We can see how Especially Shrimps and Crabs have been increasing at record pace which is highly unusual for the bear market as the only past increases there have been during bull markets.

And especially the supply on exchanges is on a literal free-fall and nothing seems to stop it as Exchanges for the first time ever were unable to buy during a bear market but instead lost their coins at a record pace.

&#x200B;

[Chart from Glassnode Insights](https://preview.redd.it/v86npielcjoa1.png?width=2991&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92a10115d6916b94bc9ec368afd2f0d520e2ad47)

Also here Whales are having a decrease of supply which is rather in line with the last bear markets and actually even lower this time as even they are holding for the long-term.

This all just shows how the supply is being taken from the “richer“ holding groups and are being transferred to us Shrimps or Crabs. Which will bode very very well for the next bull market as exchanges will be able to use less manipulation on the markets, though they will of course try. Don‘t know about you but I am the most excited to know how this will play out in a bull market…",partymsl,36,14,0.72

A friend keeps telling me it will be aligned with gold in a 1:1 ratio and I don’t understand where he’s getting that from. I’m curious to see if you have had much experience with it or if there are any benefits or drawbacks that you see right out of the gate. I’m thinking about throwing some money at it because it’s super cheap anyway and it’s not a huge deal to put some beer money into it. However I’d still like your input on it.

My predictions are below:
1. BTC to hit 100K EOY as bullrun is back.
2. Help I've been scammed all my Crypto how do I get it back.
3. Shiba army is getting ready to hit 1 cent.
4. Redditor regrets selling 1000 moons in 2022 which is now worth $100,000
5. Elon Musk posts a dog emoji.
6. Solana promises no more downtime with the newest upgrades.

My wife isn't as into crypto as I am, but she has been using the Sweatcoin app for a while without being able to get the actual crypto, so she has some non-crypto Sweatcoins built up already. This is exciting news overall and could lead to more people learning how to use a crypto wallet, etc. Real use cases!",coastereight,4,0,0.5
175,Taking profits,11uu0pn,"What is your strategy for taking profits? I want to have one before the expected BTC-fueled 2024-2025 bull run.

Looking at past performance, BTC peaked at the following times:

Nov 2021: $69k
Dec 2017: $20k
Nov 2013: $1.2k 

So if I’m making my plan based on timing history says take profits Q4 2025.  If I’m basing it off of price points, here’s what those bull run highs were compared to bear market lows:

2014 low: $111. 2017 high was a 180x gain from that point.
2018 low: $3.1k. 2021 high was a 22x gain from that point.

So if I’m basing it off price from BTC’s $15k 2022 bear market low, the 2025 peak should be between $330k-2.7m.  Now, I don’t think BTC will go that high. I think the most likely case is another lower run, in terms of increase %.  I’d put the range between a 8x-20x gain, which would be 120k-300k.

I know history doesn’t repeat, but I think it’s reasonable that it will rhyme.  I think the best plan is to not take any profits until Q2 2025 at the earliest, and no lower than 120k.

176,Not your keys not your coins,11utvi5,"Putting this here for anyone interested in added security for their Meta Mask wallet…… I did post comments in another thread here to make sure this wasn’t a bad idea or security risk and was told that it does in fact add another level of security being that you have to physically approve transactions on Meta Mask by confirming with your Ledger hardware wallet. 
Also pay close attention to the part about not using the Ledger seed phrase for the M Mask wallet but instead generate a new one in Meta Mask itself …..

I am not trying to say that prices will either go up or down. I am just trying to say that people have a tendency to get excited and overinvest when they see a stream of overoptimistic news in their feed.

We should act level headed especially in times of sudden movements. If you have a DCA plan, just stick to it. Macroeconomical scenario is still bearish, so long term is what we should really be aiming for. Wish you all great wealth & health for the future!",angry_koala_26,25,3,0.64

179,Forgotten your vault password? This may help you...,11utmha,"There was a recent post from a user who had forgotten the password to their moon vault and lost their moons in the process. As someone who has experienced this first hand (RIP 10k moons) I shared a quick tip that I wish I'd known before creating a new vault

There are (some pretty specific) requirements when creating your vault password which you may have forgotten. They are as follows:

\-12 characters

\-1 special symbol

\-1 capital letter

\-1 digit

The important thing to note is that **these requirements aren't made clear when trying your password.** You may be inputting your 10 or 11 digit password, not realising it requires an unusually long 12 character minimum. And also a special symbol

So if you're inputting your regular password and it doesn't quite meet the requirements then try chucking a number (maybe 1, or your birthyear) and also a special character (maybe ! or # ) until you pass the 12 character threshold

Just wanted to share this here as [it helped countless people](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11u5bku/comment/jcmghen/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in the thread it was initially posted in

180,Talking about crypto to family members is going to be socially accepted (again) sooner than we think.,11utkai,"I guess I'm not the only one that very happily spoke about crypto in family gatherings during the peak of the 2021 season. And probably not the only one that wasn't brave enough to bring up the same topic during 2022 when prices went down. 

Given how 2023 is developing, I'm at this point where I'm sure that crypto will be back during family conversations, considering what is going on with Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse or First Republic. I think crypto is holding up pretty well and has bounced back quickly enough after what happened with FTX.

Do you agree? Or do you think that crypto will still be a taboo after the price action from 2022 and events like the FTX debacle?",sesejordan,77,16,0.71
181,The ultimate buy high sell low strategy guide.,11ut03c,"Do you want to lose money quickly and efficiently in the crypto market? Look no further than the buy high, sell low strategy. This is the perfect way to say goodbye to your hard-earned cash in no time at all.

To begin, start by investing in cryptocurrencies that are already experiencing a surge in value. Don't bother researching the project or the team behind it, just go with whatever is popular and seems to be going up. Once you have bought in, sit back and wait for the prices to skyrocket even further.

Once the prices have peaked, it's time to sell, right? Wrong! Hold on to your investments even as they start to fall. This is the perfect opportunity to lose even more money. Keep telling yourself that the prices will bounce back, even as they continue to plummet.

When the prices hit rock bottom, and you are left with nothing but worthless tokens, that's the perfect time to sell. Congratulations, you have just lost a significant amount of money, and you've done it with remarkable efficiency.

Some may ask, ""What if the cryptocurrency rebounds and goes back up in value?"" Don't worry, the chances of that happening are slim to none. Just accept your losses and move on to the next hot cryptocurrency, ready to repeat the cycle all over again.

182,"From being a doubter, I am starting to believe more and more that the anti-crypto bank-related theories have real merit",11usj77,"The FDIC decided to close Signature Bank because they represent “extraordinary risk”. Signature representatives claim that the FDIC shuttered their door due to a anti-crypto stance. What is at least somewhat interesting is, Barney Frank who sat on their board, is an ex-Congressman, and was one of the two men responsible for overhauling the US banking system post-2008. Frank asserts that regulators targeted the bank to send an “anti-crypto message.” He also spoke about his further post-2008 proposals, as part of the Frank-Dodd act it is inferred, that would have protected more depositors and prevented this situation we find ourselves in today once again, but these proposals did not pass in Congress. The irony is that the exact measures that the Fed, Treasury and FDIC have taken today are exactly what he proposed over a decade ago. I’d think this is the guy to know something about something.

Flash-forward to today, the CEO of JP Morgan had requested a meeting with Fed Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. This meeting occurred where they “brainstormed ideas”, with some input from the FDIC head as well. Can you imagine the heads of the FDIC, Treasury and Federal Reserve responding to a request for and hopping on a call to “brainstorm ideas” with anyone in crypto?  

Now I understand this is a bit unfair. The fiat banking system is indeed critical to the economy, but it understates either enormous power and influence, or some perverse incentive for  regulators. 

What does dig at me though, is the dozens of articles I’ve had to dig through to find that fact reports that JP Morgan, the Fed, Treasury and FDIC did have effectively a closed door meeting, that was all requested by JP Morgan. It just *stinks.*

Now out of their “brainstorming”, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are each depositing $5 billion in First Republic, the banks[ announced in a statement](https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/press-release/2023/bank-of-america-citigroup-jpmorgan-chase-wells-fargo-goldman-sachs-morgan-stanley-bny-mellon-pnc-bank-state-street-truist-and-u-s-bank-to-make-uninsured-deposits-totaling-30-billion-into-first-republic-bank). Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are depositing $2.5 billion each for a total of 30B or so. These deposits are *supposedly* to be treated like regular deposits, but we know that is 99.9% probably not true. Big banks are going to ensure priority on thor deposits.

Then there was the *initial* framing of bank failure as crypto’s fault, until they backpedalled when the public who seem still enraged from 2008, just weren’t buying it. Also, the near-collapse of First Republic and the cracking pressure on other non-crypto-friendly banks was just making it clear that wasn’t true. Besides that, buys in the crypto market are making it clear that media would probably just end up alienating their audience.

And then there’s the fact that the bailed out First Republic was said to be in a very similar situation like Signature Bank if not worse, but Signature was closed and First Republic was rescued. Interesting choice. Of course, there are the allegations that Signature asked Signature to stop crypto activity but frankly that is a fairly weak substantiation.

Now, we are seeing banks borrow record highs of 164B from Fed backstop facilities, which do actually come at some cost, which implies that there are actually a lot of stressed banks, probably somewhere close to the position of where Signature and First Republic were. *Maybe,*  it is just a *coincidence* that Signature was the one that happened to fail first and also happened to be a crypto-friendy bank, even though if it were only given just just one more working day  until Monday thereabout, with all the facilities by the FDIC, Treasury and Fed to sure up banks they would have almost absolutely pulled through. This is assuming they would have even failed without forced closure at all.

And I don’t think I even need to *start* on anything the SEC has done. Meanwhile banks get away with slaps on the wrist from the SEC after their several violations and frauds a year quota, still usually at a profit from the fraud or violation’s returns after losses from the fine.

Regulators aside, U.S. legislators demanded details on American banks’ connections to cryptocurrency in a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell back in December. Democratic senators Tina Smith of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts both specifically mentioned Signature Bank and Silvergate..in their warning about the connections between traditional banks and cryptocurrency. Ironically, it was the same Elizabeth Warren who to repeal 2018 rollback of critical Dodd-Frank protections from 2018. In yet *another* twist of irony, Warren again wrote a letter to seek answers for the Signature Bank collapse, which in reality, was a forced closure rather than a collapse but again the fact that it was a closure rather than a collapse is a key detail being omitted by the majority of news outlets.

On the point of news outlets, I also recently made a [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11tv3l4/moneyand_government_power_talks_forbes_has/)about a very “pro-crypto” and/or pro-decentralization article by Forbes, that also held government at fault for the current banking collapse, and how the Forbes magically backpedalled days later, and change the article to something that remove the blame on government and regulators.

At this point, you’d have to be illogical to at least dismiss the possibility of serious foul play, if not outright manipulation and abuse of power.

183,If you would become finance minister of your (or any) country what would change in crypto related laws?,11usizm,"Let's say you become finance minister of your country and you can make all finance related decisions. As we know in reality finance ministers doesn't make decisions alone and have limited power, but for the sake of this post let's say your power in terms of economy and finance laws related to crypto would be almost unlimited. What laws would you create?

I would reduce crypto tax to 0%  for taking out profit up to $500k yearly, 2% between $500k and $2mln and 5% for anything over $2 mln. State would get their fair share for doing nothing and it wouldn't be anything too much. Ofc profits taken would  only count if you would sell crypto for fiat, no crypto to crypto transactions would count as profit (I look at you US). Also airdrops or NFTs wouldn't count as profit untill sold for fiat either.

I would encourage crypto industry to grow and  people could invest and take profits safely. State doesn't need control or power over crypto, leaving it alone would be enough. I would  also encourage miners to move to my country and try to create pro crypto envirement. I would reduce taxes for miners that use renovable energy and blockchain programming  companies. I would  reduce taxes a bit for people that would like to take up to 10% their salary in BTC. I would also make BTC legal tender in the country with all big and medium businesses  obligated to accept BTC as a form payment. I would leave it optional for small businesses, cause forcing them to accept crypto when they barely survive in modern economy  would be bad. 

I would make crypto division in police to help people against scams, to get their lost money back and to educate. I would put in school curriculum some basic info about  BTC and crypto and open free blockchain courses on all public universities.

I would also give people a choice to save part of their retirement money ( up to 30% in BTC or ETH) in form of crypto. I would also make BTC and ETH long term ""federal"" reserves, maybe something like $20 billion in BTC and $10 billion in ETH. That is not that much money for my country.


I think that would be enough for crypto industry to blossom and my country would become one of crypto paradises. What would you guys change in crypto laws if you could become finance ministers?",Nuewim,35,13,0.8
184,Ditch the CEX: Four Promising Decentralized Exchanges (With pretty UI screenshots),11ushob,"Since the collapse of FTX, I went on a journey to mitigate my risk, and minimize my exposure to centralized entities. I have since proudly achieved full self custody of all my holdings, and do not rely on centralized entities *whatsoever* in my investment/trading approach. 

In my quest, I have also come across some really powerful decentralized exchanges. For most of us who use De-Fi, we know **Uniswap, Pancakeswap**, etc. as the go-to places to swap our tokens. 

However, there has been a lot of innovation in the DEX/DEX aggregator space as of late, and there are now platforms that make trading on a DEX seem like you are still using a sleek and polished centralized application.

Here are four of my favorite decentralized exchanges, to help you all on your journey to self custody. I will disclaim, I do not hold any of the tokens associated with these exchanges, and am not invested in any way - I simply have used the platforms and like what they have to offer.

**GMX (** [**https://gmx.io/#/**](https://gmx.io/#/) **)**

https://preview.redd.it/98o2as55sioa1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1b9186cdb62fddb9061be5fd4cc9861ee1093fcf

GMX is a decentralized perpetual exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and AVAX with up to 50x leverage directly from their self custodial wallets. It has a total trading volume of $112,878,515,563 at the time of writing. 

The exchange reduces liquidation risks through high-quality price feeds and allows users to save on costs by entering and exiting positions with minimal spread and zero price impact. Users can also open positions through a simple swap interface. GMX is currently available on Arbitrum and Avalanche networks.

GMX is an ecosystem consisting of two tokens: GMX and GLP. GMX is a utility and governance token that accrues 30% of the platform's generated fees, while GLP is a liquidity provider token that accrues 70% of the platform's generated fees. The reported APR for GMX on the site is 11.78% on Arbitrum and 11.08% on Avalanche, while the APR for GLP is reported 51.06% on Arbitrum and 42.25% on Avalanche.

**DYDX (** [**https://trade.dydx.exchange/trade**](https://trade.dydx.exchange/trade) **)**

https://preview.redd.it/ihr6b6m9sioa1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0592402a0e3437c6bfbc1cab7d46a006349ea6bb

dYdX is a decentralized exchange that specializes in trading perpetual contracts for digital assets. These contracts enable traders to profit from price fluctuations without owning the underlying asset and without the limitations of contract expiration. 

The dYdX protocol is based on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes smart contracts via the Starkware Layer 2 technology known as StarkEx. This allows for swift transaction processing on the platform. However, dYdX aims to decentralize the order book and matching engine fully by transitioning the protocol to its independent Cosmos-based blockchain in the V4 upgrade.

dYdX boasts an advanced, yet user-friendly interface, minimal fees, and efficient transaction processing, as well as the ability to offer up to 20x leverage on positions. 

These features, along with others, have established dYdX as a fast growing decentralized alternative to centralized exchanges (CEXs).

**ApolloX (** [**https://www.apollox.finance/en/futures/BTCUSDT**](https://www.apollox.finance/en/futures/BTCUSDT) **)**

https://preview.redd.it/7cctd84csioa1.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=79b5b23b4235d6468cf626da55f9f693f34ea19c

ApolloX positions itself as a pioneering hybrid cryptocurrency exchange that combines the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Its launch in 2021 has empowered users to engage in secure and seamless trading on both the ApolloX Centralized Exchange (CEX) and Decentralized Exchange (DEX) with leverage of up to 150x. The platform offers an extensive range of spot and futures markets, along with a comprehensive suite of trading tools and a robust ecosystem to facilitate broader access to crypto and blockchain technologies. As part of its ongoing development, ApolloX announced in 2022 a token burn program and its transition to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), known as ApolloX 2.0.

**KyberSwap (** [**https://kyberswap.com/swap/polygon**](https://kyberswap.com/swap/polygon) **)**

KyberSwap's suite of solutions was developed with the objective of establishing an open and decentralized liquidity framework for the DeFi ecosystem. Kyberswap allows for purchasing of crypto directly to a wallet such as metamask, without the CEX intermediary.

By employing a range of tools, KyberSwap can optimize capital efficiency across DEXes, thereby delivering the best possible rates for traders while ensuring maximum yield for liquidity providers. 

The KyberSwap solution suite is founded on the principles of accessibility and decentralization in financial infrastructure, allowing for sustainable compounding of value within the DeFi space through alignment of liquidity incentives.

Since its inception, KyberSwap has powered over 100 integrated projects and enabled thousands of users to execute transactions valued at over US$11 billion. 

The platform is currently available on 13 chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Avalanche, Fantom, Cronos, Arbitrum, BitTorrent, Velas, Aurora, Oasis and Optimism, and aggregates liquidity from over 80 DEXs to provide the most favorable rates for swap transactions.",DeeperBags,10,7,0.82

186,Another post on how to secure a seed passphrase,11us5zp,"Vitalik's post on multisig wallets and wallets with social recovery has been reposted and looked into __ad nauseam__ now, so I will just assume that whoever reads this has already read it (if not: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11tijiv/how_i_think_about_choosing_guardians_for_multisig). There is, however, a third possibility along with multisig and social recovery, which has the great advantage of being completely chain-agnostic: Shamir's Sharing Secrete Scheme (SSSS). This is nothing new at all, many people will probably have already heard about it (although that probably doesn't mean all of them know exactly how to use it)... This post is for those who don't know and/or have only a vague idea and would like to know more. Even more importantly, this post might be helpful for those who split their passphrase into three, four, pieces hidden at different locations, or are thinking of doing so: SSSS is a mathematically secure way of doing it.

So, what is it? Essentially, SSSS allows one to create N shares from a secret (i.e. a passphrase) such as M shares suffices to reconstruct. N and M can be any, with N equal to or larger than M, clearly. The scheme has the following properties:

- any M shares out of the total N can reconstruct the secret, i.e. you don't need to worry about their order or having a particular share, unlikely the case where you - say - split your passphrase in three word groups A, B and C, where you will have to make sure to have a copy of each and to put them in the right order

- at any time, if you have the secret, you can generate new shares, in case some are lost, bringing the total number from N to N' (M shares will be needed to reconstruct the secret anyway)

- if someone gains M-1 shares, they cannot simply bruteforce the last one, because that will be as expensive as bruteforcing the secret itself

You can use such a setup however you like, either just hiding the shares in secure places you have access to, or distributing them to guardians, or some hybrid setup as well.

Finally, a few words on how to actually do it. I will only discuss what I consider the possibile best way and this will not be an extensive guide, just an outline:

- if you don't have it already, get Tails OS, the amnesiac live Linux distro. Tails is a well-respected privacy-focused Linux distro that can be booted up from a USB drive or a CD and runs directly in the RAM on your computer (i.e. the volatile memory), meaning that whatever you do in it will NOT be written to your hard disk or seen by the OS on it. Caveat: Tails must be installed on the USB drive/CD using a computer that you trust not to be infected, you must boot in it on a computer whose hardware and firmware you trust were not altered maliciously. For more info about Tails, how to install it and use it, see here: https://tails.boum.org/.

- Once you have Tails and you are comfortable enough with it, boot in it __in offline mode__. You don't need any additional software, the utility to use SSSS is already included in Tails.

- Fire up a terminal, then look up this man page to learn how to split a secret into shares and how to recombine: https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssss. Play with it until you're comfortable enough to do it with your actual passphrase. Caveat: The tool works for secrets up to 1024 bits and if you write every word of your passphrase in ful,l you will most likely exceed that limit; however, writing only the first four letters for each word will be sufficient to identify the exact word in the bip-39 wordlist. 

- Make sure you can reconstruct your passphrase using the shares.

- Write your shares down on the medium you prefer (paper, metal, etc.) and secure them (store them in safe locations, distribute them to guardians, hybrid strategy).

187,I am interested in how the community feels about IOTEX,11uqveh," As the title states, I am just interested in how the overall crypto community views IOTEX? I have tried to look into IOT in general and the main two cryptos I have found are IOTA and IOTEX. 

I read some info that said IOTEX is working with the US NAVY but I'm not sure if it's true or not. Or even if it matters. I would think that it shows a great deal of trust and potential for growth if they are indeed partnering with the military. However, I am also aware of the great amount of waste, cronyism, and failed ventures with the military in the past. 

So anyway, how does this crypto look to everyone? Does it have potential? Can it compete with IOTA? Is it a scam? All honest opinions welcome and thanks in advance.

189,Coinbase card,11uqrl5,"Hey everybody.. trying to get a feel on the sub for who uses what and to what degree? Maybe a little discussion on rewards. 

Coinbase obviously offers to US users rewards on purchases made with the Coinbase card. Users load fiat onto the card with a fee > users make everyday purchases with no transaction fees > users earn 1-4% on different cryptocurrencies. 

This months rewards being:
1% on XLM
0.5% on BTC, ETH, MATIC and USDC


Keep in mind that when you load your card with let’s say $50 - you pay a deposit fee of 3% (at time of writing $50 USD is a $1.50 fee) 

Say I spend my $48.50 on groceries- I’ll earn “1%” (.48 cents) in XLM - less than a percent of $50. 

When you load the same card with $1,000- you pay a 2.5% deposit fee.  

Spend $1,000 on gas and groceries- earn 1% (10$) in XLM.

Unless you scale this to a large deposit to get better deposit fees OR get better reward rates (3% and higher) this seems almost negligible or even provides loss for a lot of retail investors. 

Do they ever offer 4% back on BTC or ETH? Or is it always random alt-coins? Which are subject to even greater volatility. 

Understandably this brings use case to cryptocurrency and everyday payments, but some people may use this card at a disadvantage and thought it could be discussed and maybe some people do benefit from it. 

In my opinion retail is NOT depositing their whole paycheck onto the Coinbase card and only investing “little” amounts- $1,000 and less.

191,Some stats about round 37,11uph6x,"Hello all, 

recently I became a little bit obsessed with numbers, so I would like to share some basic stats about the distribution round 37. Of course, we will focus on Karma. 

The core of the discussion will be the following chart, which is a distribution of how many karma points were gained by how many users (On the horizontal axis the karma bins, while on the vertical axis the count of each bin):

For reference, the total amount of users who were taken into account are 11601. As you can see the vast majority has gained much less than 100 Karma points. 

To make this even clearer, I will report the main quartiles and the mean (I'll also put some additional info in brackets, for those of you who are not familiar with quartiles):

\- 1st Quartile: 4 (25% of eligible users gathered 4 or less karma points)

\- 2nd Quartile (Median): 14 (50% of eligible users gathered 14 or less karma points)

\- 3rd Quartile: 53 (75% of eligible users gathered 53 or less karma points)

\- Mean (or average): 116,8

I want to close with a last piece of info, which is what happens if we consider the top 1% karma points earners:

\- 99 percentile: 1848 (meaning that 99% of users gained less than 1848 karma points)

\- Number of users in top1%: 116

192,Quick summary of the SEC vs XRP lawsuit,11upb0d,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and its co-founder Chris Larsen in December 2020, alleging that they conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP tokens. The SEC claims that XRP is a security and therefore subject to SEC regulations, while Ripple Labs and its executives argue that XRP is a currency like Bitcoin and Ethereum and therefore not subject to securities laws.

The lawsuit has been closely watched by the cryptocurrency industry, as a ruling against Ripple could have far-reaching consequences for other cryptocurrencies. As of March 2023, the lawsuit is still ongoing, with both parties engaged in a discovery process to gather evidence and prepare their cases. In September 2021, the SEC filed a motion seeking to compel Ripple to produce additional documents related to XRP sales, which Ripple has objected to on the grounds of privilege. A hearing on the motion is scheduled for April 2023.

In the meantime, the XRP market has been affected by the lawsuit, with some exchanges delisting or suspending trading of XRP in response to the SEC's allegations. Ripple has also faced legal challenges from XRP holders who claim to have suffered losses as a result of the SEC's actions. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the lawsuit, Ripple has continued to develop its products and services, including its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform, which uses XRP to facilitate cross-border payments.",maurinet79,19,5,0.72
193,Advantages crypto has over today’s banking system,11up4hm,"1. Decentralization: Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized,meaning they are not controlled by a central authority Making them less vulnerable to manipulation and interference.

2. Security: Cryptocurrencies use advanced encryption techniques to secure transactions and keep user information private

3. Faster Transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions can be completed in seconds or minutes, whereas traditional banking transactions can take days or even weeks to complete.

4. Lower Fees: Transactions typically have much lower fees than traditional banking transactions. This is because crypto doesn’t require middle men like banks to process transactions.

5. Accessibility: Anyone with internet connection can use crypto regardless of their location or financial status. This makes them accessible to millions of people who may not have access to traditional banking services.

6. Greater Transparency: Crypto provides a high level of transparency, allowing users to track every transaction and ensure that their funds are being used as intended.

Why?

\- They allege that Ripple company executives illegally sold Ripple to investors without first registering it as a security

Of course Ripple disputes this, they say the token should not be considered an investment contract and is used facilitate cross-border transactions between banks and other financial institutions.

In December of 2022 both sides submitted their final rounds, and the hope is that a judge will rule and avoid trail.

The case could settle as soon as June, but the only ruling Ripple would accept is that it is not a security.

Everyone's favorite SEC man Gary says that he views almost all crypto as a security.(Fuck YOU GARY Fuck You!) He only views Bitcoin as not being a security due to “no group of individuals in the middle,” meaning investors aren’t “betting” on an intermediary.

He sent a message to the hacker that he had lost all his savings. And the hacker returned the money. In his message to the user, he stated that it was his life savings, which was 78 ETH (130,000 USD), which he had placed in the Euler Finance protocol.

A few days ago, the Euler Finance DeFi protocol was hacked using an flash loan attack. The hacker managed to withdraw various assets worth nearly $200 million.

Tldr: crypto and the bear market are the gateway for financial education, or at least financial curiosity, for the new generation. 

I will speak for my own personal experience but I think some, if not most, will agree. Especially my generation.

I'm 30 years old and I have a decent job. But I NEVER cared or even bothered to improve my financial literacy.

How does the FED work? At what rate are they printing money? What are bonds? How big is public debt? How does inflation work? What's the current rate of inflation? What financial products does the government and banks provide? What's the risk? Etc etc..

Big mistake. Everyone and I mean everyone should know what's going on with monetary policy. It's the policy that most directly impacts your life.

I'm portuguese. And at least in my country they teach 0 about economy and how money works. Let me say that again, they teach 0.

If you never bother to do your own research and get some financial education you will become an adult with no idea how money really works and who controls it.

Now enters crypto. I get skin in the game. While the bull goes on me no care no much.

But a big bear comes along and ""wtf is happening with the world? Why is inflation so high, how much did they print, why are banks collapsing, what does that mean for my crypto and my job/salary?""

I learn about risk. About rate of inflation. About burning. About securities. About reserves. About bonds. About yield. Etc etc..

Firstly, there was the decentralised currency argument. It was argued that BTC has value as one can transfer value across the world, cheaply, without an intermediary. However, with limited adoption (apart from El Salvador), moderately high fees and slow transactions, this argument has fallen by the way side. 

Replacing the currency argument is that Bitcoin is a Store of Value (SoV). This argument held up very well during Covid, with Bitcoin's incredible price action. However, with higher interest rates and inflation, Bitcoin's price fell through the floor, while more traditional SoVs, like gold, held their price action very well. I've noticed that the SoV argument has become less and less used in day-to-day justifications.

Given we are now moving back to the war portion of the war-peace geopolitical cycle, using the dollar and the traditional monetary network to sanction enemies is going to become more important. Does Bitcoin weaken the West's position? It's obvious to most people that the West has a growing number of enemies whose values are antithetical to freedom - mainly Russia, China and Iran.

214,What we can learn from Autocracies,11uksvw,"TL:DR at the end

Autocrat leaders and their countries are often under critique from media outside the own country. As we all know, autocrats don’t like being critiqued so they try their best to discredit the information. This is often done by depicting other countries and their news outlets as enemies of the own country. By framing the source of the information as the “opponent”, the autocrat then can discredit the information as an attempt from the enemy to weaken the country, its political structures or whatever. The dangerous thing about this is that once “unfriendly” countries are framed as “the enemy trying to negatively influence us” all information from this source is potentially seen as an attempt to do harm, no matter the subject.

This is a crypto subreddit, why should I care?

Probably you already know where I want to go with this. We need to be cautious not to fall into behaviour as described above. We all want crypto to succeed and in order for that to happen we need to listen to people who criticize crypto. We need to talk about the cons, as well as the pros. Not every critique is FUD and meant to harm the crypto space. Obiously, from time to time there is misinformation. But that does not mean that we should discard all information not praising crypto. We should try our best to be open-minded and this post is my attempt to bring a little bit more open-mindedness and constructive criticism into this sub.

215,What does being a whole coiner mean to you?,11uk7eg,"Bitcoin has been doing fabulously well this week. As it stands, it spiked to $27k, and along with it, our morale. Although we see Bitcoin as a long-term investment and will DCA steadfastly into it, no matter its price action, it’s a nice feeling to watch it pump.

We know that the concept of being a ‘whole coiner’ is just our monkey brain being comfortable with a nice round number. Indeed, integer bias is well documented. Still, the notion of accumulating one whole Bitcoin is an option that people gravitate towards because achieving this milestone will make you one of the exclusive 980k people who have done likewise. To many of us, it means finishing a stacking marathon we have begun years ago. (Of course, the quest to accumulate the second Bitcoin begins soon later.) Fir better or for worse, it is a tangible manifestation of our conviction and commitment. 

Hence, my question: what does having 1 BTC mean to you? And does Bitcoin’s current pump make you more fired up to get to one whole coin as soon as possible even though you rationally know that buying more BTC now will average up your purchase price?",cryotosensei,264,26,0.63

Moral of the story? If you see arbitrum as a withdrawal option from an exchange it's for Arbitrum One not Arbitrum Nova. Apparently they're too different things 😭

But if you made the same mistake or maybe even sent your ETH to Optimism have no fear! Simply get a multi coin wallet that supports Ethereum, Arbitrum One, Optimism, etc. Then create a new wallet with your Reddit seed phrase.

Walla! There's your funds safe and sound on Ethereum or Arbitrum or wherever the fuck they are.

They were too afraid to buy when BTC was under $20k, but now when prices pump they FOMO with no hestitation... That kind of behaviour is bad for investor that should use brain to make their decisions. Don't let people talking about bullrun or greed of others dictate what you should do. If you were too afraid to buy when for months prices were very low ask yourself why you want to buy now. If it cold calculation and faith in crypto in long term or just you emotions and greed?

Will we go up or down? No one knows shit about fuck. Don't let fools fool you with talking about bullrun, we are far from it. With every small pump in last months people started FOMO, just to spread FUD few days later. Now when pump is higher FOMO also will be higher. Many people bought BTC for $50k or $60k, they won't be satisfied with any result other than that. They have false hope that after 2 years they will be in green again. Most of them would probably hold through next ATH too, if you follow emotions like fear and greed you will be always victim of them.

If you want to be better than average stop following herd like another mindless ship, instead YOLO and FOMO buy the dip and DCA. We had dip for months, if you missed it you have no excuses. Now best idea is to DCA. You want to buy BTC or other crypto now? Your choice, just don't buy all at once with no hestitation. It probably will end terribly.

But let's take a moment to consider some bear cases, just to stay grounded and not get carried away too nuch. Here are 3 reasons I can think of from the top of my head why moons might not do as well as we hope.

- There's always the risk that Reddit might end the project because of their IPO. Actually this could happen for a variety of reasons but the IPO is the most likely one. Or maybe government regulations. Either way, moons would be kill.

- when moons are listed on a major exchange it will be easier to sell them. Everyone expects them to rise but it could could also lead to people dumping their moons and causing the price to drop.

- another risk is that whales might dump their moons. This could cause a significant drop in price and affect the overall market. The distribution of moons is not very fair and there are a few very big players that will be in the territory of life changing gains very soon...

I'm still bullish on moons overall, and absolutely love the project but please let's not get carried away and stay careful. Nothing is guaranteed ever with crypto.

Do you guys know of any other bear cases we should consider?

The portfolios consist of five coins that are highly favored by people here and five that are widely disliked. In order to provide a reference point for comparing these portfolios, a control portfolio was established with an even split of 50% Bitcoin and 50% Ethereum. **(Our favourite coin had to be excluded due to sub rules)**

223,Friday was the second day this week that crypto decoupled from US tech,11uip3a,"On Monday the NASDAQ dropped while crypto rose (as did gold).  The same thing happened Friday (yesterday), as Russia tensions grew on Finland's NATO announcement.

Since the dawn of crypto, there have been two main investment narratives for this novel asset class:
1. Crypto is a high-risk asset that sells off in times of fear in close correlation to speculative tech stocks.
2. Crypto is a safe haven asset that will rise in times of fear because it is not dependent on establishment finance and governments.

We should be careful not to create a false dichotomy as these two narratives likely have always coexisted in influence.  The vast majority of prior evidence suggests that 1 is the far more prevalent narrative, but two days this week show us that people have not given up on 2.  If crypto is going to grow into the digital safe haven that purists have envisioned, now would certainly be a sensible time to do so.  I, for one, will be watching charts very closely next week.

224,Don't rely on revoking tokens. It's too late and will not going to prevent you from being drained by most scams. The best practice is to approve only the amount needed for dApp and use a separate hot wallet.,11uioig,"Revoking is useless against the majority of scams.

**If there were a malicious dApp, you'd be drained immediately after approving unlimited spending before you even had the chance to revoke it.**

Revoking is only good against dApps that started out honestly but later either had a bug exploited or decided to rug pull later on.

And sometimes revoking isn't even easy to do. When Arbitrum One first launched, there was no revoke tool and you had to manually revoke tokens through each token contract's *approve(spender, amount)* function.

**Instead, the best practices are:**

**1) Don't interact with sketchy dApps**: But that's a separate topic.

**2) Approve only the necessary spending limit**: During the approval request, [you can edit the allowance](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6055177143579-How-to-customize-token-approvals-with-a-custom-spend-limit) in your wallet's software client. Once you've finished your swap or trade, the remaining allowance amount will automatic decrease by the amount used and drop to 0.

**3) Use a separate hot wallet**. Keep most of your funds in a cold wallet where they're safe and never interact with dApps.

It doesn't hurt to regularly check for tokens to revoke, but please don't rely on it.

**Hardware devices**: If you have hardware devices to secure both your hot or cold wallets, that's even better protection. But not everyone will need one since it's expensive and not everyone has a large account.

Contrary to common advice, if you only have one hardware wallet, it's better to secure the hot wallet first, not the cold wallet. Cold wallets are already safe from most attacks since they don't interact with anything except for the hot wallet. In fact, delete your cold wallet's software client if you're not using it. You should already have its seed stored elsewhere in multiple locations.",FluffayPenguin,12,2,0.58

Their strategy is simple. They hold some value stocks. But split also some money into possible ten bagger stocks. 

I am also invested into stocks. But I don’t think its worth it, to hope for ten bagger stocks.

In my opinion its better to buy value and dividend stocks for the more or less safe haven. But use the planed ten bagger money inside the crypto space.

Every bullrun we see much more than 10x in many coins. Within few weeks people made 20-50x in crypto. But shareholder have to wait many years for their ten bagger moments. Meanwhile they could buy and sell crypto in several cycles…

227,Self-custody Vitalik propose (having guardians and using multisig) is not self-custody. It is basically a bank in all but name.,11uhph1,"When Vitalik advocated for self-custody I was all for it. Decentralisation, responsibility and self-custody over your crypto was one of our main goals. It is important to understand in crypto we and only we are responsible for our money and we should have all control. Only you and no one else can use your crypto. That's can be both advantage and disadvantage, cause it require you to be careful. But it can't be done otherwise, if someone can't take responsibility they should just stick to th banks and leave banks in full control over their own money. But that would be complete oppositiom of all ideals  of crypto.


Now when I hear Vitalik say that by self-custody he mean having guardians over your money and using multisig for your wallets I am confused as hell. Cause it is exact opposite of self-custody, it is centralization with little power over your money. Basically a bank in all but name or at least what teenagers  purchases are ( before age of 18 kids can have a card or make big purchases but parents are guardians and have control including revoking all transactions). It is not any self-custody.

I am fan of Vitalik, but doesn't mean everything he say or do is right. I also had mixed feelings about him trading shitcoins (even if he got them for free probably better was to just ignore them or burn than sell, he doesn't need money) or playing with USDC when it fell to $0.9, especially when so many of people in crypto look up to him as some authority and may try to do the same.  In regard of his opinion of self-custody I think the same and I am concerned why he do something harmful to the space. Did he already forgot the reason why he created Ethereum was centralisation he saw while playing WOW as  teenager?

If you use guardians or multisig to your own wallets you lose control, you can't just send crypto in or out, you need other people's approval. Even if they are your family would you let them control your life? Or maybe better make your guardian some random you don't know, your financial advisor,  guy from bank or your  lawyer... That would backfire easily especially after your death. Your family would tear each other apart fighting for approving  using multisig  to share your crypto. Not first time not last time when familes fight about money. At least when you have full control over your crypto you can give keys after your death to one person  divide it in way you like.

Instead of regular repayments, the government then takes it in crypto…. This event coupled with the already hodl’d holdings of bad guy crypto funds, puts the government as one of the largest holders of various coins.

Do they even need to centralize this at that point?  They could in essence act as the largest whale controlling and manipulating the market as they accumulate, confiscate and get repaid for various bailouts…

236,"Basics of crypto storage, Web3 and security",11uewx9,"As someone who has been in crypto for close to 6 years I see people who are just getting into it making some of the same mistakes over and over. Here are a few things I think everyone should do in their first few months owning crypto

1) learn about and invest in a hard wallet 

2) be overly cautious or even paranoid about signing into your wallet/where you store your seed phrase

3) try and use some of the tech that your investing in 

I’m sure we have all seen the posts that have gone around for as long as crypto has existed that follow the theme of “I lost (a large sum of money) because my wallet was hacked or I gave out my seed phrase” that’s shits scary especially when your balls deep into crypto. 
The best way to avoid situations like that are first investing in a hard wallet also known as a physical place to store your crypto(not online) and make sure your seen phrase is 100% offline. 

After you get your hard wallet your going to set up an online wallet somewhere like MetaMask in order to interact with platforms like sushi swap or coinbase. That online wallet will serve at a sort of passage between your hard wallet (cold storage) and the outside world on the internet. Your hard wallet should never come into contact with anything on the internet besides your own MetaMask. 
This is to prevent people from being able to get into your larger stores of crypto that is kept on the hard wallet. In addition to this when you create a seed phrase for the love of god don’t put it in your notes app or google drive, people can target and hack those platforms and then they have all your crypto. Write it on paper and keep it in a safe place or better yet memorize it. 

When it comes to the first point I made above I think everyone should try to understand and even build something on web3 in order to better comprehend the space that so many of us are dumping our hard earned fiat into.

237,I would like to start a company which stores commodities and tokenizes them. What lengths do you think I will have to go through to convince people its actually not a scam?,11uewtl,"List of commodities that might work:

A. Industrial Metals

1. Copper
2. Zinc
3. Tin
4. Aluminum
5. Nickel

B. Forest Products

1. Hardwood, board feet

C. Other

1. Rubber
2. Amber
3. Oil

I wouldn't do all the above, likely just specialize in one or two. Obviously shelf-life is a concern, so I like industrial metals and rubber. Oil too!

I think an important feature of these types of tokenized commodities is that they are 100% redeemable...in person (what do you think about that? Perhaps an appropriate redemption fee?)

Depending on the commodity type, an ERC20 token or ERC 721, would be appropriate. I like the way PAX Gold does it, as an erc-20 token, but if you want to redeem you need at least 400 PAXG to actually take possession. I think that if you held a tokenized barrel of oil and you wanted to take possession of it, you should be able to do it! Same for a bar of copper.

But lets get to the root issue, TRUST. How many scams? So many. I don't see how I can actually market this without encountering mountains of ""scam"" and ""sus"" comments. Short of Vitalik Buterin himself endorsing it, I think the juice is not worth the squeeze.

238,Can someone explain how agEUR got depegged?,11udwqs,"I am a tad confused and can't find anything that explains it in simple terms. The closes thing I could find was this explanation from [LammaRisk](https://twitter.com/LlamaRisk/status/1636460843381723136) on Twitter.

If I understand it correctly, a platform called Euler Finance was hacked and many different stabletoken pools were affected by it (somehow). One of which was agEUR. I am confused about why agEUR was so heavily impacted as opposed to the others (volume/liquidity) and how Eurler being hacked caused it.

So the question is, why did the price have such a massive drop? and why the price is still depegged?

I was surprised to discover that activity on the Arbitrum Nova network also qualifies you for the airdrop.  You need to hit certain transaction thresholds during the evaluation period (snapshot on 2/6) to qualify.  

I was thrilled to see my 10+ transactions (tips) earned me 1,750 tokens!  I deserve some flack, as I had many Brick, not Moon, tips.  People are estimating the ARB token value between $1-$1.50, thus I’ve got a virtual $2K - $3K - from tipping on this sub!  This is truly IRL Karma for the generous tippers on r/cc.

So I have used the price of crypto during “after hours” to metric us fiat market performance for the following day. crypto, in general, has been a better indicator of future fiat market performance vs. typical “futures” for over a year now. Anyways, over the last week or so, there has been a major decoupling of the price of crypto vs. the broader us fiat market; this is reflected in the price of (Crypto-with-E) specifically which has not been able to hold over 1700 for any considerable amount of time until the last day. To me, this is a HUGE bullish signal that there are NEW investors in the crypto market looking for new exposure vs the typical us fiat market. If we can get some support over (crypto-with-e)/$1700, I really think we are on a clear path to define a new floor.

242,Next week could be the best ever week for Redditors here. It also shows the potential of web 3.0 to reward participants by taking control away from greedy corporates,11ucxx4,"Next week, active members of cc/sub have a chance to qualify for 2 big drops.

It's like 2 paydays back to back! Mark your calenders if you haven't already.

On **Wednesday, 22 March**: It's the Moon Distribution Day, Babeh!

On **Thursday, 23 March** : Arbitrum goes live. Anyone who has previously has previously interacted with the Arbitrum Nova network (the native blockchain to our beloved Moons), before February is likely eligible for the ARB distribution.

It's like a threesome payday for me in the next week, with fiat mining payday coming as well. Heck, I might even upgrade my daily instant Ramen to a medium-rare steak for once!

But, there is a bigger point to make here - and it's the potential of how decentralisation and Web 3.0 can reward the ordinary man on the street who participates.

Those who participated in cc/sub, making comments and posts got rewarded with moon distribution. This is arguably Reddit's main way they have gave back to its participants. Imagine if someone like Zucker decided to launch their shitty Libra coin? Think there's any chance of US, the users being rewarded? Nah, it'll just be a cash grab by Zucker.

Second, the Arbitrum drop only happened because THEY also decided to reward the USERS in the ecosystem. Arbitrum also decided to be decentralised, put decision-making in a DAO and the founders renounced control of the token. Look at VC-infested coins like Solana. Did users get anything when they launched - NO, it was the VCs who profited from distribution and dumped on the retail afterwards.

A web 3.0 future, where **USERS** are the ones who get **Rewarded** for their participation, and not greedy corporates or their buddies is the ideal vision for all of us. Kudos to Reddit and Arbitrum for showing the way, and hopefully more will follow suit in the future.",Every_Hunt_160,53,17,0.72

I am new(ish) to the world of crypto and although I have a basic understanding of a few aspects regarding it, I have seen some mixed things about this as well as mixed reviews in general about them/it.

I have the seed phrase to my wallet(s) and have written it down/hidden it so, I am assuming that I own them and that no one will be able to have access to any of it...right?

 I like the fact that I can explore Dapps with the built-in browser, the customer service is amazing when I need help with something or something I don't understand comes up, and the overall interface is generally very pleasing. The only negatives I have so far is that it is fairly slow at uploading prices and updating totals, Also, it does not have a historical portfolio tracker and I cannot figure out how to use the Delta Portfolio Tracking app since I have transferred multiple coins to, and from, the wallet and do not know what price they were bought at, therefore I am not able to correctly track my profit/loss along with a few other things.

244,A short write-up about why Bitcoin could go sky-high while we see gradual failures of DeFi protocols. USDC / USDT addressed...,11ucdq4,"I'm not a financial advisor. None of this is financial advice.              

So, no doubt everyone was nervous about the USDC depegging event a week ago. I certainly was.                   

But here's why: I work in the industry and one of the companies I work for has a treasury in USDC. Last weekend I was looking at the charts for a stablecoin that was created by a company that was ""playing by the rules"" and had made no wrong moves.                  

People at the company floated the idea of using other stablecoins, but noted that the situation wouldn't be that much better if we went with tether.                  

But the thing is, I started thinking about, ""Well, what if USDC depegs again, but the depeg is longer-lasting? People will lose confidence in the idea of a properly-collateralized stablecoin.""                

That's why I think bitcoin started pumping this last week. When you trust a stablecoin you're trusting two parties; 1 - the blockchain it's on as well as... 2 - the method it uses to match itself to the USD.               

Maybe my thesis is wrong. We'll find out soon enough.           

#EDIT: I'm dumb. I forgot to substantiate my claim in the OP. Please see below.                

If there is a day when stablecoins see a failure to maintain their 1:1 pegs on the dollar, due to whatever reason, then DeFi protocols are at greater risk of collapse than bitcoin. In the previous sentence I said, ""due to whatever reason"". So a question to ask here is, ""What if all the banks that hold USD begin to show weakness with their USD reserves? What if we see something like the SVB situation on a larger scale?"" It's also worth noting that the bank that collapsed last time was buying U.S. Treasury Bonds and they still went under until they got FDIC insurance to kick in and made all of their customers whole.",sgtslaughterTV,20,7,0.68
245,Blankos Block Party - A Review of the first blockchain game listed on Epic Games Store,11u9jvy,"**This is a review of Blankos Block Party**, the first blockchain game released on the Epic Games Store in Dec 2020 as an early-access game. The full game wasn't launched until Sept 28, 2022.

TL;DR review at the bottom

[ Flying over the Junction map ](https://preview.redd.it/17xzfedx5eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d191cebd25f40a28d6f3c4a22b4ef66360b99945)

## Intro

**Blankos Block Party** is a traditional F2P game that I later found out only has scant traces of blockchain properties. The characters you buy are minted on the private Mythical blockchain. Each character has slightly different traits and can be leveled up in-game.

Blankos is a multiplayer party game with 3 main modes:

* **Racing**: Race against other players on a dangerous camp and get to the finish line first.
* **Vibe Collection**: Collect the most vibe objects on the map faster than everyone else.
* **Shooting**: Shoot other players and KO more than everyone else.

Every mode has many different maps. Some are dev-created, and some are user-created, so there's a huge variety.

[ Brawl waiting area ](https://preview.redd.it/i8idsyaz5eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3964de358d0bcf8d88cb73a31e06e2fa83a85f23)

## The Characters - Blankos

[Right Blanko is the free one every gets at the start. Left Blanko is a free giveaway from the marketplace.](https://preview.redd.it/ne3f12u06eoa1.jpg?width=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c551573948c781d01ab4ff5be73aa0d300f4355d)

You start out with a newbie Blanko. Each Blanko has its own special properties, moves, and abilities. The vast majority of the paid ones are about $5-10 and are minted through the Mystical marketplace store. The most expensive ones can be hundreds of dollars. You earn \~10 Blanko Bucks per game you play, which takes about 10-20 minutes to finish. You need about 1000 BBs for the cheaper paid Blankos, so it takes 100 games to get there. It's totally not worth your time unless you love the game.

Each Blanko can be leveled up and given perks (like Call of Duty) for additional special abilities like flying higher, spinning longer, recharging faster, or having a shield.

## The 4 Modes

There are a lot of veteran players here with high-leveled Blankos and special abilities. They will dominate your free Blanko, so don't expect to win your first several matches.

It takes about 3-5 minutes to match with other players in a Brawl, which is a set of 3 games with randomized modes and maps. Some maps are poorly designed while others are amazing.

**Racing**

This is like those Mario 64 / Mario Galaxy racing games where there's a bit of platforming. Every map is different. This is my favorite mode.

[Racing - Like Mario Kart, but worse and with platforming](https://preview.redd.it/osm7wlo56eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc3441a2a927047d9fa4786ee3e80a459c1bd817)

**Vibe Collection**

You're put into a room with lots of vibe objects. Collect them faster than everyone else. Some of the better maps require a bit of difficult platforming, but most are bland. This is my least favorite mode.

[Vibe Collection - Get as many lightning objects in the limited time](https://preview.redd.it/w226h1oa6eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9f4216e39fcbcb13543cf5626ad00c20fc410e9e)

**Shooting**

It's a standard Death Match. Collect guns and ammo in a room, and KO more people than everyone else. There are only 3 main types of runs (handgun, semi-automatic, and rocket launcher). This mode is broken. People were killing me in 3 seconds while I could shoot them for 10 seconds in a row while not doing any damage. I later found out that there is considerable lag and the players were abusing this by constantly jumping up and down, which somehow ruins the hitbox.

[Knockout - A basic deathmatch](https://preview.redd.it/9evygwdf6eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a2886c9066bcce1d1c8c268a2ccc6503dfe6523f)

**Junction**

I'm not exactly sure what this is. It's an open-plaza of many locations. I think it was intended as a meeting place for people to hang out when not playing. However, it's empty like most of Decentraland. It would be really cool if they added gameplay modes here, but there's currently nothing to do here except explore by yourself.

## The Blockchain Element

This is one of those traditional games that doesn't need a blockchain. You wouldn't even notice if they replaced the blockchain with a traditional database.

All sales are done in fiat. You can't connect your wallet to the blockchain or marketplace.

The Blankos and player items are minted on the completely-private Mythical blockchain. This blockchain is only used for the 2 Mythical games: Blankos and Rivals (an NFL fantasy-league-like collection game). It's so private there isn't even a blockchain explorer.

The only connection to a public blockchain is through the Ethereum bridge. You can bridge your Blankos to the Ethereum mainnet using Mythical's website, and then sell them as NFTs on OpenSea.

## My Ratings

**Gameplay**: 3/5 - There are plenty of more-enjoyable traditional multiplayer games. There's nothing special about Blankos.

**Blockchain**: 1/5 - Barely uses the blockchain and would do just fine without one.

When I was younger, I used to play games so much I probably went 2 full decades where I completed a new game every week. Nowadays, I don't have that much time, so if a game doesn't interest me after a day, I just drop it. Blankos Block Party is one of those games I drop. It barely qualifies as a blockchain game, so I wasn't curious enough to stick around.

Blankos is more fun than many other crypto games I've played, but that's an awfully-low standard. It's like playing Mario Party, but sober and with random strangers. The only reason Mario Party and Wii Sports were fun for me when I younger is because I played with my roommates, and they were stupid fun when we were all drunk.

* **Racing** is like Mario Kart + Fall Guys, but worse
* **Shooting**: is like Unreal Tournament, but way worse
* **Vibe Collection** is like a typical timed fetch/item collection quest, and who enjoy fetch quests?",Maleficent_Plankton,6,7,0.89

248,The Reddit app is suggesting to back up your vault via cloud using Google drive. I highly suggest you do not do this.,11ua50d,"Since the introduction of Reddit vaults, each Reddit user in this sub has the ability to open up their own decentralized wallet called a Vault and collect community points on the blockchain such as Moons or Bricks via upvotes every month.   
Since this wallet is self managed it is truly your keys your crypto and you're responsibility to keep your own seedphrase backed up and secured.   
The best way to back up and secure your seed phrase is to write it down on paper and store in a safe location, although some may find the 2 minutes of work a little annoying and some users don't do this at all.   
Reddit has an option of backing up your seedphrase on the cloud via Google drive, ironically metamask mobile and coinbase wallet also has a similar option of backing up your seedphrase via Google drive or icloud.   
Seedphrase backup via cloud is one of the worst ways to store your private keys, since it's on the internet this allows a path for hackers or scammers to gain access to your seedphrase.   
People trying to steal your crypto are relentless these days and spend a lot of time and energy into trying to steal your funds via phishing, social engineering, sim swapping, scrapping data breach lists on the darkweb, some groups have turned this into a full time business, hell even North Korea does it.   
It won't happen to you? We recently had someone in this sub lose 300k of crypto because they had their seedphrases on their Evernote cloud account.

250,"I have developed a new validation protocol, PON",11u9o7s,"Proof-of-Nudes (PoN) protocols are a class of consensus mechanisms for blockchains that work by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of nudes in the associated cryptocurrency. This is done to avoid the computational cost of proof-of-work schemes.

Proof of Nudes uses a manual validation of nudes to verify transactions, requiring a potential attacker to view more nudes than humanely possible. This incentivizes validators to view as many nudes as they like. PoN is more energy-efficient because people are already viewing nudes so it's a kill two birds with one stone kind of thing.

The first coin that will use this technology is called SPANK. SPANK can be mined by submitting your nudes to the validators called BANK.  SPANK BANK validators will rank the nudes from 1-10 and after 20 validations are complete, the average rank will determine how many new coins are added to the blockchain and given to the miner.

251,Your Hardware Wallet CAN be drained- even IF you keep your seed phrase secure! Are you safe? Please learn how to Revoke Allowances!,11u9jf4,"I see more and more people here reporting that they have been hacked, so I figured I'd write this post.  **TL:DR** is on the bottom for those impatient crypto souls :)  If even one person is saved, my late night rambling is worth it. I'm not a pro by ANY means, but I've been around the block long enough to know a thing or two, and lost a few dollars here and there ;)  The goal of this post is to be as straight forward as possible, like if I was explaining this to a 5 year old. If you're experienced, you may find it a little boring.

Most new investors dabble in shitcoins available on DEX's while looking for those 1000x gains. They dig through telegram and discord channels looking for the next ETH. Not only are they new, and inexperienced, but now they're digging in the deep end of the pool. This is where the risk lies. The scammers love the deep end of the crypto pool...

Most **crypto investors think that by having a hardware wallet and keeping their crypto on one, they are immune to being hacked and robbed.** If you are one of those people (like I was in 2018), **you are wrong**. The old school wrench attack is not your worry here. **Not revoking allowances is...**

For starters, did you ever interact with ANY smart contract using your hardware wallet? If so, you gotta do some ""clean up"". By that, I don't mean disconnecting from a dapp in MetaMask. That won't help you, even if it makes you feel better.

**\*\*\*This token approval allowance check has to be done for every blockchain\*\*\***

*You can use etherscan or bsc scan to manually verify allowances on both chains if you do not feel confident using revoke dot cash. I know I didn't feel confident using it myself, until I verified the website through multiple sources.*

&#x200B;

Go to revoke(dot)cash and paste your wallet address,

or go to:

https://etherscan(dot)io/tokenapprovalchecker

*Better yet! To be safe, go to the legitimate etherscan website you always use, click on ""More"" in the right hand top corner, and under ""Services"" you will find the ""Token Approvals"" that will lead to the exact same link, as above :)*

*As to revoke(dot)cash, I wrote it like that so anybody can just type it in themselves without worrying about clicking on random links from reddit :)*

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*DON'T JUST GOOGLE THOSE LINKS, PHISHING LINK DO SHOW UP!!! STAY SAFE!!!\*\*\***

What did you find?

Uniswap? Curve? 1inch? Maybe a shitcoin contract you interacted with 2 years ago?

Should you revoke allowances for an old school dapp such as Uniswap or Curve? **You bet you should!** What if THEY get taken for a ride due to a bug in their smart contract? Your money will be at risk.

Disconnecting your wallet from a dapp app doesn't keep you safe. This is a great explanation of why that is the case:

## Revoking approvals vs. disconnecting apps: what's the difference?

It's easy to confuse these two processes, but they are fundamentally different:

* **Disconnecting your wallet** from a dapp involves cancelling permission for it to see your public address and your token balances, and, depending on what you originally consented to, stopping it from initiating transactions (although *not* executing them) and viewing past activity.
* **Revoking an approval/allowance** means a dapp can no longer access the contents of your wallet and move them around.

Shitcoin galore, mostly :D

Now imagine there is USDC here, with an **Unlimited Allowance**, and an **Authorized Spender you don't know**. That contract **will be able to drain** your funds even if they are on a **hardware wallet, hot wallet, metamask, paper wallet-** you name it.

You **won't even have to approve the transaction**, you already did it once before if it says **Unlimited**.

Chances are, you didn't even know that you approved the smart contract to drain your wallet. Hey, I didn't know! I just clicked next!

Look at the Angela token authorized spender- would you trust that smart contract with your money if instead of some Angela shitcoin it was authorized to spend all your USDC? You sure wouldn't!

One day you wake up, and **your money is gone**. It happened to a few people here recently. One guy lost like **$250k**. **His money was in a hardware wallet**, safe, secure, locked away. It didn't matter. That's some life changing money to a lot of us regular working folks. People jumped from roof tops over losing much less.

Most of us are not experts in Solidity. If the wallet says we gotta approve a blind transaction, we do. Obviously, most of us can't read code, and the people stealing from us know that's our greatest weakness...

**TL:DR**

**So to reiterate,**

Check ALL your addresses

Revoke ALL the allowances (do this monthly, or even more frequently)

Most of all, **DO NOT USE YOUR HARDWARE/ HOLDING WALLET TO INTERACT WITH SMART CONTRACTS!**

Your safest bet is to transfer your assets you are gonna play around with to a hot wallet, and interact with the smart contract you gotta interact with from that wallet only. No exceptions.

It's really easy to lose your money in this space. Crypto is not very user friendly yet. One wrong click can make you go broke.

Learn, invest, and **stay safe** :)

252,Thoughts on Diversification When Investing Small Amounts,11u9evm,"I wanted to have a discussion about diversification of assets when only investing small amounts. I myself, and I think many others on here, want to be a part of crypto, but unfortunately cannot invest too much. I obviously know the benefits of diversification when having large amounts of money invested in something. But my question is, is it still worth it to diversify if you're only DCAing maybe $100 or $200 a month? Or with that small of an investment, should I just stick to investing in one of the bigger, ""safer"" assets like Bitcoin and just call it a day? 

Also, if you think diversification is still important, how would you go about it? Would you split a $100 DCA into smaller chunks and buy small amounts of a few different assets, or alternate every month (buying $100 of one asset one month, and buying $100 of another asset the next month)? 

Obviously I'm not going to automatically do what people on here say, but I just wanted to get an idea of what everyone thinks of this. Thanks for any responses!",grundlesquatch,42,8,0.72

254,Some remarks on cryptocurrency scams and what to do if you've been swindled.,11u8997,"So we all have some level of fear of losing our crypto to a scammer or hacker and commiserate when one of us loses out either through our own momentary stupidity, hey in some cases it might be perpetual <shrug> or a hacker gets access by seducing one of us and poking around in our phone after a night of raucous passion and is able to gain access to our wallets because we don't use anything beyond a finger print and hey yeah so some of might fall into a deep sex coma after hours of getting freaky, don't judge.

I bet at least one of us has been socially engineered into disclosing our key phrase during a game of drug fueled charades... I'm not judging and you shouldn't either, criminals are wily and use many tactics to get the goods. The goods being our sweaty bags of tokens.   


The FTC has some things to say about scammers such as: ""**Never mix online dating and investment advice**. If you meet someone on a dating site or app, and they want to show you how to invest in crypto, or asks you to send them crypto, that’s a scam. ""   


They might even ask you to pay for sex with crypto, don't do this unless prostitution is legal where you plan to do the dirty, because if it's not the police won't help you get your money back if your hooker doesn't put out, and that would be doubly sad.    


Or ""**A scammer pretends to be a celebrity who can multiply any cryptocurrency you send them.** But celebrities aren’t contacting you through social media. It’s a scammer. And if you click on an unexpected link they send or send cryptocurrency to a so-called celebrity’s QR code, that money will go straight to a scammer and it’ll be gone. ""  


If Willy Nelson starts texting you asking for some THC coin it's maybe... okay probably, a scam.  


""**Scammers impersonate well-known companies.** These come in waves, and scammers might say they’re from Amazon, Microsoft, FedEx, your bank, or many others. They’ll text, call, email, or send messages on social media — or maybe put a pop-up alert on your computer. They might say there’s fraud on your account, or your money is at risk — and to fix it, you need to buy crypto and send it to them. But that’s a scam. If you click the link in any message, answer the call, or call back the number on the pop-up, you’ll be connected to a scammer. ""     


Scamazon 1984, Microsoftcore, and Feds Expressing Themselves are not companies that will ask you for crypto, don't send anyone claiming to be them your keys or anything else.  


""  **Scammers impersonate government agencies, law enforcement, or utility companies.** They might say there’s a legal problem, 	that you owe money, or your accounts or benefits are frozen as part of an investigation. They tell you to solve the problem or protect your money by buying cryptocurrency. They might say to send it to a wallet address they give you — for “safe keeping.” Some scammers even stay on the phone with you as they direct you to a cryptocurrency ATM and give step-by-step instruction on how to insert money and convert it to cryptocurrency. They’ll direct you to send the crypto by scanning a QR code they give you, which directs the payment right into their digital wallet — and then 	it’s gone. ""  


TLDR: If you want to read about what the FTC has to say about crypto scammers you can check out the link. Personally I don't feel like they put much effort into the site, not a single dick joke or sexual innuendo <disappointed face>

255,Crypto highlights,11u77uv,"Crypto successes

Crypto investing always seems to have a negative reaction in the press and most stories people share are either massive losses, forgotten passwords and being hacked. 

It’s a stigma I think we need to move away from and we should be focusing on more positive attributes of crypto as it becomes more main stream.

What investment have you made in crypto that you either did well on, are a firm believer in or think has a good usage?

257,My opinion on bank crisis (why I think it is not related to crypto).,11u6t63,"I will try to explain it as short as I possibly can.
First of all, we all know that banks are literally detached with system and states (without a state, credits, fundings, and obviosly sistem itself-banks wont be able to operate). They are protected by law and state (they have legitimate power to chase us for our money obligations related to them-which is system related). They are privileged. In return of that, they have to listen everything that the state itself and government says. That is why money printing and laundering (as all of us are highly conscious they do) is allowed to them with state's eyes closed. System can make profit out of them and use it. They can cover their dirty money that way. I would call it ""legalised mafia work"".
That system is working that way many years back and it is not a secret. It had to break at some point, as we all are aware that crisis is worldwide and economics is in total destruction, inflation is literally highest in the room.
Crypto, on the other side is for my opinion on the completelly other track. Common attacking on it exists because people's eyes are opening and they can't lie us an hide from us like they used to be. People are waking up and realising that crypto is much bigger than they thought it would be and much more reliable and dependable than banks and stocking money in banks, so they decided to give it a try. 
So, why would government make the stocks of crypto go incredably up if they know that it is something that they can't control like any other thing and we know how much war-likely they are opened to crypto. Doing everything to sabotage it and convince people that crypto world is world of lies and thiefes, and not their. So why would they intentionally make the stocks go up? Makes no sence to me. They know we arent fools and that none would believe them in their ""good intentions."" Maybe they figured out that it is something much bigger then the system and now they try to find a way to get along with it ""without notice"" and to ""join it"" so they could make higher profit and control every platform or market.
But I still dont thing that the prices going up has to do anything with them directly. Makes no sense to make something you want to destroy (its value) more worthy. No conspiracy, just an interesting coincidence in timing.

258,My Reasoning for Why the Banking Collapse Wasn’t Aimed at Crypto,11u5gcd,"The last couple of days articles about the banking collapse being caused to try and take out crypto have been all over this subreddit. There are a couple reasons that come to my mind right off the bat for why this would not be the case. 

Looking at the banks and how they were either structured or run by the executives higher interest rates were eventually going to kill them. Signature Bank for example was locked in to short term 3-6 year loans at extremely low rates compared to now. If we take a look at Credit Suisse the bank had not only under performed for over a decade but it has been paying billions in fines at the same time! 

Taking a look at this from another example is good old fashion heard mentality. Over the last week now rumors have run crazy resulting in regional banks, that have lower capital requirements, having billions in cash taken out. Well if all of your friends and family are doing it and putting their money in one of the big 4 then odds are you will to it’s just human nature. 

This final reason I saved for last because it is just plain sad but does anyone think Powell would be that smart? Causing a bank run which only cause crypto banks to fold would be challenging but theoretically could be done. Powell just isn’t that smart though to do that and to think he is just look at the state of the economy! The guy cares a lot about his reputation and legacy something that with this run is even further blown up compared to just a week ago. I hate to say it he just plain couldn’t pull that off if you are asking me.

This is the BIG news of today !

After the use of article 49.3, decided on Thursday by Emmanuel Macron, Craig decided to do the same to be finally recognized as Satoshi Nakamoto by the French Autorities. He declared it on twitter early today:

[As you see, he proclaimed it on twitter](https://preview.redd.it/oyinvb4h8doa1.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9087236cd3e5c6da34939159ba15db4ac2df94af)

**What is the 49.3 Article ?**

*""The Prime Minister may, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers, engage the responsibility of the Government before the National Assembly on the vote on a finance or social security financing bill. In this case, this project is considered adopted, unless a motion of censure, tabled within the following twenty-four hours, is voted under the conditions provided for in the preceding paragraph. The Prime Minister may, in addition, use this procedure for another bill or a bill per session.""*

**How does it works ?**

*""During the vote on a bill or a private member's bill, the Prime Minister may decide to engage the responsibility of the Government. In this case:*

1 - *The use of Article 49.3 of the Constitution is subject to prior deliberation in the Council of Ministers.*

2 - *The bill or the proposal of law is then deemed adopted unless a motion of censure is tabled within 24 hours and signed by at least one tenth of the members of the National Assembly.""*

**In the street in France, a fury in the face of a deaf government.**

If you watch the news today, you have seen a lot of manifestions in France. French people went to the streets to show their frustrations. Unions and demonstrators ask the executive to hear the rumble of the street, exasperated by a government ""which doesn't give a damn about people's faces"". People throwing cobblestone to the policemen. They can't believe it.

263,Crypto rallies as banks collapse and the St Louis Financial Stress index is yet to show signs of systemic financial system stress.,11u448p,"In the wake of the collapse of banks with large crypto exposures and crypto related services, along with the US federal government backstopping depositors crypto has rallied. In the last week Bitcoin has rallied 33%. Ethereum 21.86%

Banking and financial system stress are intrinsically linked to the use and value of cryptocurrencies. So what is the current health of the overall US and global financial system?

Oddly enough the St Louis Financial Stress Index, which has registered the Russian default and collapse of Long Term Capital Management, the dot com bust, September 11, 2001, obviously the 2008 financial crisis, the Greek credit crisis and concern over US financial situation involving rating agencies downgrades of US treasuries, a collapse in oil prices during 2015-16, and Covid-19 shutdowns have yet to register the recent turmoil in the banking sector.

It should be noted, however, the most recent update to the index today only accounts for conditions up until March 10th.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI4

This was developed after the 2008 financial crisis to gauge the amounts of systemic financial stress in the system. You can see it surge through the financial crisis, a rise during the Greek credit crisis and concerns over US government financial situation when treasuries were downgraded by rating agencies in 2011, being a bit above zero during the oil plunge in 2015-2016, and a surge during COVID -19 shutdowns promoting the fed to intervene in treasury markets.

So far it seems nothing about the latest banking issues are showing up in the index but I also just realized that the latest numbers are only up until March 10th. It will be interesting to see if there is a rise in the index next week.

*The STLFSI4 measures the degree of financial stress in the markets and is constructed from 18 weekly data series: seven interest rate series, six yield spreads and five other indicators. Each of these variables captures some aspect of financial stress. Accordingly, as the level of financial stress in the economy changes, the data series are likely to move together.*

*How to Interpret the Index: The average value of the index, which begins in late 1993, is designed to be zero. Thus, zero is viewed as representing normal financial market conditions. Values below zero suggest below-average financial market stress, while values above zero suggest above-average financial market stress.*

What will the index look like next week? And how will this index correlate work both on chain blockchain activity and prices of crypto related assets?",Justin534,13,4,0.61

The backlash isn't limited to Twitter. On r/belgium2 people mentioned things such as: 

>Tell me that you don't understand crypto without telling me you don't understand crypto.  
>  
>I don't like cryptocurrencies, but the NVA clearly hasn't understanded what cryptocurrencies are.  
>  
>Ok Johan, try to ban it Johan. Ban the owning of a cryptographic key, Johan.  
>  
>Always nice, such a superconservative party. Crypto is probably too woke for the right-wing.

It looks like, especially with the events of the past weeks, people clearly aren't taking it lightly that politicians even have the thought of banning crypto.

273,Who controls exchange cold wallets?,11u1pcg,"Something I’ve always wondered is what kind of protocols are in place to protect the assets in exchange cold wallets? Billions of dollars in one wallet would be catastrophic if someone were to mess up and lose or leak the private key. Who in these companies has access to it? Where do you think they keep it? What kind of measures do they take to prevent the loss of 10 billion dollars from one mistake?

It just blows my mind how the fate of so many people is all in a few wallets with a few private keys controlled by what I assume is a few people. And if those who have access to the private key die what happens?",jacksparrow2048,29,7,0.73

There will never be a large scale bank run because the fed will just print their way out of it. The older I get the more case I see for BTC and what it represents. Its a computer science breakthrough and promotes flourishing and the civil liberty of the human race.

277,"Reddit Vault vs Reddit Account, let's clear up some confusion",11tzina,"This write up may be a bit basic for a lot of you, but there seems to be MASS confusion about access to your reddit account vs access to your vault. 

You need a reddit account to create a vault. Your vault must be created in the mobile app.

When you create your vault, you need to SECURELY record 2 things:

1. Your vault password (you need this to access your vault via reddit on another device and work with items in your vault)

2. Your vault seed (you need this to import your vault into a wallet - more on that below).


**If an attacker gains access to your reddit account, unless they also have one of the pieces of information above, they DO NOT have access to your vault.**

Likewise, if an attacker has access to your vault seed, they have access to EVERYTHING in your vault, without having any access to your reddit account.

You can actually access your reddit vault outside of accessing your reddit account at all, by using a 3rd party wallet. (Metamask is super popular for this).

To access your vault in Metamask [follow this guide] (https://www.reddit.com/user/nanooverbtc/comments/wkfivm/instructions_to_add_arbitrum_novas_network_and/). 

Remember, your vault is on the blockchain and once setup, completely independent of your reddit account!

278,Bitcoin reaches 10 years uninterrupted uptime!,11u00gr," Bitcoin unlocked an amazing achievement: **10 years** continuous uptime (**3,650 days**)!

[ Source: https:\/\/bitcoinuptime.org ](https://preview.redd.it/7b0nkq0ahcoa1.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=24e31c410a16c2321ff56f63cae79fd2de980b40)

Let's go back in time. What happend in **2013** & **2010**? 

&#x200B;

**2010**

 ""On August 15 2010, it was discovered that block 74638 contained a transaction that created 184,467,440,737.09551616 bitcoins for three different addresses. Two addresses received 92.2 billion bitcoins each, and whoever solved the block got an extra 0.01 BTC that did not exist prior to the transaction. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed.

A new version of the client was published within five hours of the discovery that contained a soft forking change to the consensus rules that rejected output value overflow transactions (as well as any transaction that paid more than 21 million bitcoins in an output for any reason). The block chain was forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the ""bad"" block chain, the ""good"" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691 at which point all nodes accepted the ""good"" blockchain as the authoritative source of Bitcoin transaction history.

The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain. Therefore, the bitcoins created by it do not exist either. While the transaction does not exist anymore, the 0.5 BTC that was consumed by it does. It appears to have come from a faucet and has not been used since.""

[Source\_2010](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident)

&#x200B;

**2013**

**What went wrong?**

""A block that had a larger number of total transaction inputs than previously seen was mined and broadcasted. Bitcoin 0.8 nodes were able to handle this, but some pre-0.8 Bitcoin nodes rejected it, causing an unexpected fork of the blockchain. The pre-0.8-incompatible chain (from here on, the 0.8 chain) at that point had around 60% of the mining hash power ensuring the split did not automatically resolve (as would have occurred if the pre-0.8 chain outpaced the 0.8 chain in total work, forcing 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain).

In order to restore a canonical chain as soon as possible, BTCGuild and Slush downgraded their Bitcoin 0.8 nodes to 0.7 so their pools would also reject the larger block. This placed majority hashpower on the chain without the larger block, thus eventually causing the 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain.

During this time there was at least one large double spend. However, it was done by someone experimenting to see if it was possible and was not intended to be malicious.""

&#x200B;

 **What went right ?**

\- The split was detected very quickly.

\- The right people were online and available in IRC or could be contacted directly.

\- Marek Palatinus (Slush) and Michael Marsee (Eleuthria of BTCGuild) quickly downgraded their nodes to restore a pre-0.8 chain as canonical, despite the fact that this caused them to sacrifice significant amounts of money.

\- Deposits to the major exchanges and payments via BitPay were also suspended (and then un-suspended) very quickly.

\- Fortunately, the only attack on a merchant was done by someone who was not intending to actually steal money

280,Better fraud/scam protection is needed for easier mass adaptation of crypto.,11tymc1,"**Problem:**

One of the biggest issues I see (and also complaints) with crypto is that it is too easy to get scammed. I don’t think this happens disproportionately in crypto, since thousands of people are scammed every day on their debit cards. The real issue with crypto is unless you are paying for some kind of recovery service (that doesn’t happen to just be another scam) you are completely out of luck and lost all your money. 

**How it’s handled now:** 

Transaction fee’s and insurance really. When a claim is filed with a bank they attempt to reclaim the funds from the merchant, if they can’t the bank and visa (or whoever) split the cost. Visa covers this from the fees they charge on every transaction and the bank covers with overdraft and other maintenance fees. 

**How crypto can address this:**

Provide a similar service. Maybe not to the extent that visa or the banks can offer but what about a blockchain insurance company. They could set up a wallet to promote better security and offer transaction protection for a small additional fee. In the event your assets are lost due to fraud they either have on hand investigators to track down the funds or they outsource. Because they cover these costs they could offer 80% back (whether they can successfully recover or not) and use the 20% of the funds they do recover to help fund this pool. 

It definitely isn’t a perfect solution but I genuinely think there’s the basis for a good idea there. I’d love to hear other people’s thoughts!

**Edit:**

To add there are many options that do not involve centralizing (although I don’t see why a centralized option would be a bad thing). 

Things like two factor could be added as a wallet feature as well as built in black listed addresses where scams could be reported. You could also have one with customizable controls only allowing certain types of transactions or addresses. There’s definitely a lot of room for improvement between where we are and centralization.",robbie5643,83,5,0.65

But the current price-levels may be worth a lot more than we though. One way to “measure“ the importance of a level is to see what percentage of the whole circulating supply has been bought there. Areas where a lot of the supply was bought up act as the most important support/resistance areas.

This chart from glassnode shows how our rise of 22% to $26k has also meant a 20% surge in the Supply in Profit metric, meaning that 20% of the whole supply was purchased just between $20k and $26k. This makes our flawless run through there early this week even more impressive as many probably took profits here but we just kept rallying on.

We seem to be downplaying the current price-levels as just “low“ currently but in reality those are probably one of the most important price levels if we take a look at Bitcoin history thus clearing them is highly impressive and also crucial for the foundation of the next bull run, whenever that may be.",partymsl,28,27,0.74
283,[SERIOUS] The Banks Are Just As Suspect As Crypto Exchanges During The FTX Collapse…They Are Just Sanctioned By The Fed To Do It,11ty5ha,"If you’ve continued to follow the fallout of [Silicon Valley Bank](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/15/1163269781/silicon-valley-bank-svb-collapse-history](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/15/1163269781/silicon-valley-bank-svb-collapse-history)) (SVB), you’ve no doubt been made aware that [FRC is fighting for its life](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1144753/first-republic-bank-fighting-for-its-life-as-rescue-reveals-bad-news](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1144753/first-republic-bank-fighting-for-its-life-as-rescue-reveals-bad-news)). FRC is the 14th largest bank in the United States and it’s collapse would signal that SVB was not a lone actor, and there are number of banks that were using deposits on long term bonds that are now worth a whole lot less than they paid for them and is bringing their solvency into question if a second full on bank run were to occur.

The market is aware of the risk, and they have reacted appropriately and their stock has tanked as a result.

But that’s okay, because a number of banks have decided to [provide FRC with liquidity](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-banks-to-infuse-first-republic-with-30-billion-to-stabilize-troubled-lender-192748893.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-banks-to-infuse-first-republic-with-30-billion-to-stabilize-troubled-lender-192748893.html)) on uninsured consumer deposits so they are able to pay their customers in the event a bank run were to happen.

**Does this remind anyone of anything that happened in crypto over the last 6 months?**

CZ and Binance decide to sell FTT and tweets about it, the token crashes and because FTX holds most of its $$ in FTT FTX has no money to pay back deposits.

**A bank run happens on FTX.**

FTX collapses, crypto crashes and the entire crypto market and the stability of every exchange and all stablecoin come into question.

So what happens next?

The crypto community ask for proof of reserves, we want to know how much money is in the accounts and whether everything lines up with what exchanges and stable coins have been saying.

Rumours start to fly as we see exchanges sending money to each other, millions of dollars are being passed back and forth between exchanges and there are no reason given by the exchanges, just regular bookkeeping and accounting.

Eventually the news moves on and people forget about the scandal and the subsequent questionable transactions.

This is the exact same story, but on a much larger scale.
[Jamie Diamond, Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen]([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-the-30-billion-rescue-of-first-republic-bank-003752506.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-the-30-billion-rescue-of-first-republic-bank-003752506.html)) get on a call in a panic because they are worried about the liquidity of FRC. If FRC fails, the confidence of every “regional” bank is called into question, and even some of the large national banks will be a cause for concern.

They then come up with a plan to get **11 BANKS!** To contribute to the liquidity pool to help save FRC.

\- JP Morgan (JPM) **$5 billion**

\- Citi Group (C) **$5 billion**

\- Wells Fargo (WFC) **$5 billion**

\- Bank of America (BA) **$5 billion**

\- Goldman Sachs (GS) **$2.5 Billion**

\- Morgan Stanley (MS) **$2.5 Billion**

\- U.S. Bancorp (USB) **$1 billion**

\- Trust (TFC) **$1 billion**

\- PNC (PNC) **$1 billion**

\- State Street (STT) **$1 billion**

\- Bank of New York Mellon (BK) **$1 billion**

**This is the same scenario that the crypto exchanges went through, liquidity was gone, they kept each other afloat, only this is at a much larger scale. The only difference is that banks are heavily regulated by the fed, and are required to be more transparent with their actions so we know about it. Whereas crypto exchanges could do this behind the scenes making it mostly hearsay.**

I think the questions you should be asking are;

A) What is the **real** fallout going to be if FRC collapses, contagion etc into the banking systems and the banks that fund crypto

B) Why is the FED so involved and keen on saving these bad actors? What happens to interest rates and QT if it does, and how much liquidity will be pumped into the market to save the economy again?

C) How will crypto be affected  as a result?

D) Is the liquidity crisis actually over for crypto exchanges?

I'm sure there are many more to be asked, but it is something the crypto world needs to keep an eye on.

**tl;dr**: If FRC collapses, it could be the second large domino and could mean crazy things for the crypto market, but im not sure which direction it will go. If exchanges, stablecoins and reserves are not impacted by the collapse or contagion it could cause the value to skyrocket. If there are big players in the space impacted, it could result in a massive crash and failures of Stablecoins or Exchanges.",Tallfuck,24,2,0.54
284,Day Trading Can Be a Recipe for Disaster,11txo44,"
Cryptocurrency exchanges have become a popular destination for investors looking to make quick profits by day trading. But what most people don't realize is that these exchanges aren't always on your side.

In fact, many exchanges actually encourage day trading, even though studies have shown that 80% of day traders lose their money in the long run. Why? Because these exchanges make money on the volume of trades, not on the actual earnings of their users.

But history has proven time and time again that holding onto well-known investments is key to building long-term wealth. Instead of chasing quick profits through day trading, consider holding onto solid investments that have proven themselves over time.

keep in mind when you tempted to jump into day trading, remember that the odds are stacked against you. Instead, focus on building a strong portfolio of well-known investments that will stand the test of time.

even more than that when FTX crackdown happened it revealed that SBF had a long position that cannot lose. further more ""SBF used at least $4 billion in FTX customer funds to prop up his trading company, Alameda Research, as crypto prices fell earlier this year, according to CoinDesk.""",meowerguy,116,6,0.57

I have sent large amounts of money to friends and family in different states and countries smoothly when they needed it most for rent or a utility payment. 

Also now the IRS wants us to confirm and report payments as little as $600, do you know how many people will be doing that per month rent? Car payment? Maybe I bought a used tv on offer up? It’s an invasion of privacy but most of all it’s inconvenient and a waste of times and extra steps that are unneeded. With crypto you can literally step over the bank so they don’t squeeze you for fees everywhere.

I prefer the decentralizationI really do but if you’re gonna want us to report payments then might as well use a wallet on the blockchain then the IRS can just fucking see it instead of dogging us to report it ourselves. And then fining us if we forget one.",wpeironnet,137,56,0.79
287,MyEtherWallet - funds were sent to 3d party without consent,11tw0k6,"How I lost my crypto stash? No, I mean, really, how did I lost it?

I've never been a large player in this game but I had a few k worth of usd in it. My money wasn't spread on big guys btc, eth and so on. I had it fixed on one particular player. I won't disclose the name but it sits comfortably at 5000 rank on coinmarketcap now. Way away from public attention, lol.

Anyways, I figured that if I want to make a shot in here, I should aim for something rather cool and outstanding in the field. That was my main reason to shift my side money towards it.

And to be honest I am glad with my choice (atleast was glad...). Up until earlier this year  when I checked my MEW balance (my ether wallet) and saw zeros. My initial thought was that the coin went balistic towards the ground and reached zeroes and became useless piece of trash. As I got myself back to grip I inspected it closure since I knew that sometimes apps updates and show nonsenses but not this time.

My funds were sent to a newly created wallet (at this date it has 2 transactions - one in, one out). Then was sent to pancakeswap and swapped to other token and in some other currency got into this wallet ( 0x870CdF31020A7D10F604A41bA90b87A76F0a2903 ).

I don't wan't to disclose the invested project name, or my wallet name or any exact date since some of you will be quick to judge that the project was shite and so on, this post is not about that.

And I know that I will never recover the coins I had therefore f.ck this particuliar wallet owner. 

What I can do is to learn from this story and move on, probably put some money aside and atleast buy some of my original stake again before the bull season stars. 

A few more interesting aspects that I should mention - since 2022 october I started to get messages from facebook and twitter.

Facebook would message me once a month or so with a  

""Did you log in to Facebook from somewhere new?. It looks like someone tried to lon in to your account on 17 october at 13:14 using an unknown device"". 

I didn't pay attention since I am kinda nobody and no one should be interested in hacking to my social media account. 

 And from 2022 december I would get emails from twitter with captions like:

,,We noticed an attempt to log in to your account. ______ that seems suspicious. Was this you?""

Suspicious login details would be: Springfield, Safari on Iphone.


First of all, I am from Europe. Secondly, I hate iphones.

Let's assume you're also a member of r/books when Leaves come in.

289,Money(and Government Power) Talks: Forbes has Majorlyyy backpedalled on a pro-crypto pro-decentralisation article,11tv3l4,"Some of you may remember this post from a few days ago that linked an article from Forbes.

And this isn't the only proof. The article was linked MANY times over the internet and carries this same *original*  title referenced above.

As you can see, Forbes as dropped off the part about this banking failure being once again, just like 2008, the fault of government policy and regulators. Clearly, somebody with a lot of power got upset and forced a change in the title, which little ole Forbes quietly complied with. And we call US media ""free"". Right.

Remember all these media houseshave a process where articles have to pass through editors to be published in the first place. This piece would have had to have been approved already, such that it's someone else later on, likely external to Forbes, who had their feathers ruffled and demanded change.

In total there are 329,704 cards, one for each Redditor who has appeared on a Moon distribution CSV file from rounds 1-37.

**These are NOT NFTs**, just a fun visual card you can look at. All the values on the card are stored in a database I maintain, so your card has fixed values that won't change unless I want them to (#centralization). Of course, anyone who knows photoshop or what ""inspect element"" means can fake the stats, but you can always verify if they are being honest by entering their username into the tool.

I'll explain some details later on, but for those who just want to see their own card, the website page is [ccmoons.com/card](https://ccmoons.com/card)**.**

Here are some randomly generated cards that I liked:

If your avatar doesn't appear, this means that you haven't earned any karma in the previous 37 moons distributions, or you don't have an avatar.

Each card has the following attributes:

* HP
* Attack
* Defense
* Speed
* Overall (the average of HP, Attack, Defense, Speed)
* Type (Normal, Water, Flying, Grass, Ground, Fire, Fighting, Electric, Fairy, Ghost, Dragon)
* 2 Moves (e.g. quick attack, hyper beam, surf, etc.)
* Rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Ultra Rare, Legendary)
* Moons: Moon balance at the time I ran the script
* Karma: Sum of all karma on Moon distribution files

# How are the Stats generated?

Each stat has its own custom formula, based on information about your Moons holdings, Moon transactions/tipping, karma, subreddit activity, and account age. I won't divulge the exact formulas, but generally speaking more moons, tipping, transactions, karma, and account age relate to higher stats.

There's also a random component for each stat. Each user has a base value stat from the formula, but to introduce an element of luck, the final statistic is drawn from a Normal(base\_stat, 15) distribution.

**The average of each statistic is \~50.** But this includes many users who were hardly active, so I expect most people who see this post to have higher stats than 50.

# How is the Rarity generated?

Rarity was completely random! A ""weak"" card can still be Ultra Rare or Legendary

|Rarity|Number of Cards|
|:-|:-|
|Basic|N/A (if an error occurs or you didn't earn karma from rounds 1-36, a default card will appear)|
|Common|164,552|
|Uncommon|131,985|
|Rare|24,904|
|Ultra Rare|7,932|
|**Legendary**|**330**|

# How are the Types generated?

Types were completely random with some being more common than others. The type of the card also determined the card's styling (background image + card texture)

|Rarity|Number of Cards|
|:-|:-|
|Water|49,390|
|Normal|48,827|
|Grass|33,038|

296,How I've Been Investing in Crypto with Low Income.,11tti1b,"Greetings from Portugal. So a great part of us are in the age of 20-35, which means that with the actual inflation you either live with your parents or after you pay rent/house there isn't much money left. That's my case in portugal where I live with my girlfriend and rent is 50% of total house income.

That's why most of us became interested in cryptocurrencies, to have more financial stability.

With this, I believe it's it's helpful for a lot of us learning how to invest with low income. Even for those who have good money but don't wanna risk much.

In my own experience, **if I had saved money, I would feel less guilty about occasionally resuming bad habits I gave up, like smoking and eating fast food**, because these activities are no longer as detrimental to the economy as they once were, and since we are all human, we do deserve to spend money on fun activities. It's all because to that important investing year.

**Then what I did and still do is investing 10% of the money I have left before payday.**

One strategy I use is to **divide my investment into two parts: one for long-term holdings and one for short-term investments.** For my long-term holdings, I invest in well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. For my short-term investments, I seek out smaller, emerging cryptocurrencies with the potential for rapid growth for my short-term investments.

The upcoming Ethereum upgrades (Shanghai and Capella Upgrades, collectively known as Shapella) are expected to complete in mid April 2023 and will enable staking withdrawals for the first time since ETH staking was introduced.

You can continue staking with no action required, and your assets will be secure during this upgrade period. If you’d like to withdraw your staked ETH, here’s what you need to know: 

We expect you'll be able to submit unstaking requests from your Coinbase account within 24 hours after the upgrade.

The time taken to process unstaking requests is determined by Ethereum protocol. We anticipate the Ethereum protocol will take weeks to months to process requests immediately following the upgrade, so you may need to remain patient during this time. You’ll be able to view an estimated processing period in your account.

For those seeking immediate liquidity, Coinbase offers a utility token, cbETH, that lets users unlock the value of their staked ETH.

With this upgrade, customers will become liable for taxes owed on any staked ETH (ETH2) or cbETH rewards earned leading up to the upgrade and after.

301,How much Bitcoin is really worth considering inflation?,11trmer,"**Hey fellow redditors,**

**As I saw news about FED's pumping $300B into US banks, and pushing BTC over 26k$, I was wondering, is that really true price of the BTC?**

**So, I took annual inflation report and did some math. If someone doesn't know, inflation is around 6%.**

**Assuming an inflation rate of 6% per year, we can use the following formula to calculate the real value of $26,000 today:** 

Real value = Nominal value / (1 + inflation rate)\^n

Where n is the number of years since the nominal value was measured.

Assuming the nominal value of $26,000 was measured one year ago, we can plug in the values:

Real value = $26,000 / (1 + 0.06)\^1 Real value = $24,528.30

**So the real value of $26,000 one year ago, adjusted for 6% inflation, is $24,528.30 today.**

**And if we want to convert this to the value of Bitcoin, we would need to look up the exchange rate of Bitcoin to the US dollar at the time the $26,000 nominal value was measured. Assuming the exchange rate was 1 BTC = $26,000, the real value of 1 BTC today would be:**

Real value of 1 BTC = $24,528.30 / $26,000 = 0.9442 BTC

**So if inflation was 6% and the nominal value of Bitcoin was $26,000 one year ago, the real value of Bitcoin today would be approximately 0.9442 BTC.**

302,Ethereum Developers Have Scheduled The Shanghai Upgrade For April 12 - Shanghai Coincides With Regulatory Scrutiny Which May Analyze The Upgrade,11trddr,"Shanghai has been considered a crucial upgrade as it will allow ETH to be unstaked. Since staking was enabled in November 2020, ~15% of ETH supply, or USD 29.67B, has been committed to staking. 

Risks most typically associated with Ethereum upgrades have been of a technical nature. For example, upgrades can involuntarily introduce critical bugs into software. In 2019, Ethereum developers delayed the Constantinople upgrade after an audit firm discovered bugs in the new software. However, recent regulatory developments have attracted attention to Ethereum’s governance processes. 

The New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) charges against KuCoin for allegedly operating an unregistered securities venue, include the assertion that ETH is a security. The NYAG alleged that ‘ETH’s development and management is largely driven by a small number of developers who hold positions in ETH and stand to profit from the growth of the network and the related appreciation of ETH.’ 

Court documents also describe Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), and claim that ‘Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation retain significant influence over Ethereum and are often a driving force behind major initiatives’ which are material to the asset’s price. Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation are said to have played ‘key roles’ in the shift to PoS. 

This week Gensler said PoS tokens implicate securities laws. Gensler explained that blockchain networks often have ‘a small group of entrepreneurs and developers’ and that ‘[t]he investing public is investing anticipating a return, anticipating something on these tokens…’ that have been staked. Gensler’s answer was prompted after he was asked by reporters about CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam’s view that ETH is a commodity.

In a 2018 speech, former SEC director Bill Hinman said ‘putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.’ According to Hinman, ‘[o]ver time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required.’

Takeaway: The NYAG and Gensler have asserted that Ethereum’s governance processes, i.e. managing upgrades, deciding what to include in upgrades, etc., may impact the token’s regulatory status. 

Hinman alluded to similar consideration when he asserted that ‘sufficiently decentralized networks’ may allow associated assets to not be regulated as securities. While taken together, the NYAG charges, Gensler’s latest remarks, and Hinman’s speech may indicate a lack of consensus, they do also underscore that regulators are interested in networks’ governance processes.

305,Do you use a crypto cash back card for your everyday purchases and if so which is your favourite?,11tqrge,"Hi, as most of you probably know there is a multitude of different, crypto related cashback opportunities out there. E.g. the visa debit cards of Plutus, Binance, Crypto.com etc. Usually the amount of cashback you can get varies between 1 and 8%. Some cards come with additional bonuses like the Plutus card with e.g. 100% cashback on Spotify or Netflix. 

So my question is do you use a crypto cashback card or not? If you do, which one do you use and why? And have you thought about  swichting cards, since recently e.g. Plutus paused their crypto to fiat conversion and now charges $5 to request a withdrawal?",voxcon,72,3,0.6
306,"Bitcoin returns are almost 50% YTD in 2023. They are great now, but the hardest part is realising that for traders who lost 65% in Bitcoin in 2022, they are not at down 15% from 2022 but rather still almost ~50% down",11tqdub,"I must say I am quite surprised. The markets and this sub has seen so much jubilation since prices and returns are up. Maybe it is just that their voice are drowned out or that they have left the sub due to disappointment, but I have not come across much at all of a dose of reality for hodlers. 

Bitcoin lost around 65% of it’s value from the beginning to the end of 2022. We went from around $46,311.75 to $16,547 thereabout, which amount to about 65% in losses. Yes, 2023 has absolutely started off with a bang, but it is a bang after the dim embers of 2022. We gained nearly 50% thus far for the year, and while they are great numbers, rolling over from 2022, they are just a drop in the bucket in recovery.

If you held on last year from beginning to end, you would have lost 65% of your investment.  If you held on from the start of 2023 till today, you would have gained almost 50% YTD. But remember, you gain *50%* **on 35% remaining from 2022, that is to say you only truly gained \~17.5%. So, you are still down almost 50% from the start of 2022.**

This may be obvious to more experienced traders among us, but many new traders stumble into this pitfall. You make risky bets and if/when you lose, you think you can make it back but there’s a reason investment brokerage and exchanges are so profitable. If you lose money, it takes monumental effort and time to make it back just to breakeven. And ironically, big losses tend to make traders take even more risk and lose even more.

Everybody gets wrapped up in the percentage returns, especially on the media and advertisements telling you all the money you can make but never advise how bad a single loss can set you back. Because most just advertise for platforms that want your fees with total disregard to whether you win or lose. And this is  exactly how they also get you with leverage, leverage(without really in-depth information, extensive research and a strong market edge which very very few traders do/have) is a losing gamble. And even then it’s still risky which is why firms typically hedge by trading the opposite site in another instrument. You will only win with leverage until you lose but trading platform get their fees either way.

I know this whole post is obvious to some but it is definitely not to all. Don’t just dismiss it.All you see in media is the allure of short-term big percentage returns but not the full reality of risk and even a single loss. I think it very much needs to be said.",OneThatNoseOne,114,102,0.81

308,Short interest at one of the lowest points in the last year as broad crypto market sees major gains,11tpuyt,"Over the last 24 hours (most of which came in the last 8) we've seen short liquidations of close to $200 million dollars across the broad market.https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData

Although this number isn't staggering compared to some past major amounts in the billions, the more interesting portion is open short interest in most coins has cratered.

Just BTC alone has an abysmal 464 coins currently listed as active shorts compared to 106,000 longs according to datamish.com and the same trend is continuing across the board.

Generally speaking that's heavily bullish sentiment because it shows even the investors and companies ""in the know"" don't think this rally is close to failing anytime soon and won't risk losses on shorting hedged and especially unhedged positions.

That's off the heels of a fresh apparent bear trap that assumed the prices would fall due to the collapse of SVB which was known to be friendly to tech startups and crypto specifically. And they aren't the only ones struggling.

First republic bank also acquired much needed liquidity from other larger banks to stay afloat and may have also collapsed had they not received $30 Billion in loans. https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/16/investing/first-republic-bank/index.html

The crypto market in general seems to finally be pulling away and consistently beating legacy markets, stocks, bonds, gold as uncertainty in the banking industry looms heavy and the risk of large bailouts has reemerged once again.

This leaves both politicians and the federal reserve in a tough spot as well to figure out whether to allow more banking collapses, continue to raise rates, and eventually bailout banks with public money, all of which makes crypto look pretty secure in comparison.

Or another scenario would be I transferred some fiat from my bank to an exchange to buy some coins when prices dip.

I would like to know if the exchange has any hold on the fiat. I guess that most, if not all exchanges, have a daily withdrawal limit.

314,Bitcoin is becoming less dominated by whales.,11toi2b,"The blockchain of Bitcoin allows for a detailed analysis of the decentralized currency, including visualizing the rough structure of the BTC holder ecosystem. While this ecosystem was once dominated by whales, this is now becoming less and less the case. 

# Criticism of Bitcoin 

The main criticism of Bitcoin is that the digital currency will not be fairly distributed. People often argue that if Bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency soon, a very small group of people will hold all the power.

In a way, this is understandable and makes sense for outsiders to see it this way. It is still difficult to explain that Bitcoin is actually the fairest way to launch a new monetary system. Everyone had a chance to participate from the very beginning.

What we are seeing now is that ""people"" are taking an increasingly large share of the entire Bitcoin. While it was still an ecosystem dominated by whales before, we are now seeing more and more small holders who own relatively small amounts of BTC.

# Bitcoin shrimps and crabs

In particular, the so-called shrimps (<1 bitcoin) and crabs (1-10 bitcoin) are currently consuming large amounts of bitcoins. According to Glassnode, shrimps are buying over 100 percent of the annual production of the primary cryptocurrency. In the case of crabs, this is 119 percent

So even if miners sell 100 percent of their production, these two cohorts are still buying more bitcoins. Of course, they are buying this Bitcoin from the market.

As a result, fewer bitcoins are available for sale, and the relative scarcity of the digital currency is increasing. The more bitcoins shrimps and crabs buy, the harder it is to acquire it. Ultimately, this could only have a positive impact on the price.",plug_and_pray,178,161,0.82

Now, one way to earn some ""coins"" on the website is to click on ads.

The website request a payment via Coinbase in many different coins. I though that this could be a scam, but to confirm it I sent 2,50 USD in MATIC that I had in an alternate account to prove it. I even got a recepit for it.

Now, I think also the email that is on the bottom of the recepit is used to scam the users even more, because they will send an help request there, when they will not get the money on the account.  I didn't tried to write to the email.

I reported this to the Cointiply support and this was the asnwer:

322,Why you're witnessing history with crypto like the internet and online shopping boom.,11tl7m4,"The parallel between crypto and the early stages of this is crazy. For starters, crypto started as an idea that is meant to protect people from bank failures, and although it can't fully do that yet, it is the idea that stands. That idea started with Btc. Then you have Ethereum and a host of other projects building massive ecosystems.

The crypto world has literally been through it all and is still going through it all, but even amidst all the chaos there is NFT markets that have started gaining some traction and a collectors desirability. I feel like crypto is gonna be that big catch all thing that'll connect the internet to the real world and services and so on like the payment systems will be connected to that like a massive interlinking web.

Some say this stuff is weird like the metaverse and all those other dystopian sounding ideas, but humans and their curiosity is infinite. Crypto is another massive page in our history that is being written right now. 

If I had to speculate I'd say that by 2030- 2040ish crypto will be fully integrated as many different ideas. And contrary to what everyone says about Btc being old and better stuff existing, it kinda has that Mcdonald's level branding and notoriety that will pretty much see it always exist in one form or another.

323,I don't believe US banking regulators are trying to kill crypto. Here's why.,11tl7l4,"I've seen a number of posts now about how the Fed and FDIC are hostile towards crypto. But I have not seen any articles, statements, or regulatory actions that have convinced me this is true. Please post links to the reasons why you think this is true if you do.

What I have found, however, are a few misleading headlines and accusations that this is occurring. I know that the head of the SEC believes that many cryptocurrencies are securities. I would also suggest, not all, but there are many cryptocurrencies which meet the definition of a security in my mind. There are literal corporate bonds trading on blockchains right now. Which is awesome! And they are securities.

What I've also found is if you just read certain articles or headlines and take them at face value it could seem like the Fed, FDIC, and OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) are hostile to cryptocurrency. Most people have concluded this based on a joint statement issued by these regulators. Here's that statement:

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230223a1.pdf

If you read the first section of this statement you will read the following: 

*Banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation.*

I don't see anything hostile about this statement. I think the opposite.

The second section is titled ** Liquidity Risks Related to Certain Sources of Funding from Crypto-Asset-Related Entities**

Again I do not see anything hostile to crypto. It basically says crypto is volatile and risky. Deposits from cryptocurrency related customers might have abrupt inflows and outflows. If a bank holds reserves for a stablecoin and there are a large amount of redemptions that bank could see a large outflow of deposits.

The next section is titled **Effective Risk Management Practices**

This section basically just says this is how banks can manage these risks.

1. Analyze deposits from crypto related entities to better understand what dives the in or outflows of those customers, and identify which deposits might have unpredictable volatility.

2. Identify how interconnected those deposits are.

3. Stress test those deposits and have contingency plans if there are large outflows.

4. Make sure to do your due diligence on crypto related customers and understand that if they misrepresent their business or risks of the business there can be large outflows.

There is absolutely nothing I've seen in this statement that is hostile towards crypto. All it says is ""Hey banks!! Don't screw up again on another unregulated financial asset. Manage your risks!""

After 3AC, FTX, Celsius, Terra Luna/UST, Voyager, Blockfi, etc I think what would be wreckless is for financial regulators not to issue a statement like this.

Regulators are concerned about how much any bank exposes itself to crypto not IF they are exposed to crypto. After all the failures we've seen in the crypto space I can't blame them, can you?

324,"[NO MOONS] Vitalik shares his thoughts on how to use Guardians, Multisig wallets (like Gnosis Safe), and Social Recovery wallets",11tks1t,"Vitalik just posted this to the Ethereum subreddit. It's a good read.

No Moons since I'm copying directly from it:

--------------------------

Multisig wallets (eg. [Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/)) are an easy and safe way to store funds, and can give you most of the key benefits of **self-custody** - namely, your funds not being subject to disappearing because a centralized entity that seemed trustworthy turns out not to be at all - without the risks of having to be personally responsible for your entire security setup. I use a multisig wallet personally to store the bulk of my funds, as does the Ethereum Foundation.

A close cousin of multisig wallets is [social recovery wallets](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html), where a single key can be used to sign transactions but if that key is lost, a group of keys held by other people can be used to recover the funds. Social recovery wallets are much easier than multisig wallets to use, especially with the rise of [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) account abstraction and upcoming wallets like [Soul Wallet](https://twitter.com/zengjiajun_eth/status/1636496326723768320) that will make the technology user-friendly. In general, once social recovery wallets become mature enough, my recommendation will be to use social recovery for hot wallets that store a small portion of a person or organization's funds, and multisigs for cold wallets that store a person or organizations's savings.

Both multisig wallets and social recovery wallets rely on a concept of **guardians**: a set of N addresses, typically held by other people, of which any M can approve an operation (eg. one could set N=6 and M=4). In the case of a multisig wallet, each transaction must be signed off on by M of the N guardians. In the case of a social recovery wallet, there is a single key that can sign transactions, but if that key is lost, M of the N guardians must sign a message to reset the key.

**Two key questions in using multisig wallets and social recovery wallets securely are: (i) whom do you choose as guardians, and (ii) what instructions do you give them?** This post will outline how I think about this issue. The ideas here should mostly apply equally to multisig and social recovery wallets being used to secure funds for individuals and for organizations.

### What do we want out of guardians?

* Minimize the chance that they lose their keys
* Minimize the chance that they collude to steal your money, or get coerced into doing so
* To the extent that the above two risks are unavoidable, the risk of each guardian should be maximally _uncorrelated_ - you want to minimize commonalities that risk situations that will disable or compromise too many of your guardians at the same time.

This answer is simple and short, but it guides all of the choices that I make with regard to guardians.

### It's okay for some of the guardians to be your own devices, but not too many

It makes natural sense to have at least one guardian be a wallet on one of your own devices - it doesn't reduce decentralization to do that, and after all, it _is_ your money. Once you go above one guardian controlled by yourself, however, you get into a tricky tradeoff: you get to trust other people less, but you're also concentrating more power into yourself, which can create a risk if you get hacked, coerced, or incapacitated or die.

My rule of thumb is that enough guardians should be controlled by other people that if you disappear there are enough other guardians left to recover your funds. That is, **you should control at least 1 guardian, and at most N-M guardians**. Also, each guardian should be on a separate device (laptop, phone, old phone, etc).

### Choose guardians who do not often talk to each other or ideally do not know each other

Ideally, the guardians should not know who each other are. This greatly reduces the risk that they collude, and furthermore there is _no good reason_ for them to know each other. If something happens to you, they will still be able to find each other, because there are obvious standard protocols that naturally come to people's minds in such a situation (eg. contact your family).

Also, you want to **minimize correlations between your guardians as much as possible**: don't choose two guardians who live in the same city (or ideally even the same country), or two guardians who use the same type of wallet, and have a balance between different operating systems.

### Guardians should ask a security question before approving an operation

When you ask a guardian to approve an operation for you (in a multisig, this would be any transaction, and in a social recovery wallet, this would be resetting your account's key), they should not simply say yes immediately. This would be a disaster for security: if someone hacks into your chat account, they could scan your messages, figure out who your guardians are, contact each of them and ask them to confirm, and thereby steal your funds.

My preferred protocol to avoid this is to instruct guardians to **ask a security question**. That is, when you ask for a confirmation on your operation, the guardian should ask you something that only the two of you and very few other people know (eg. ""the last time we met, what kind of food did we have?""), and only confirm the operation if you give the correct answer. A natural alternative is voice or video calls, but in the age of AI deepfakes this is weaker evidence than before, and so you may want to combine the voice/video call with asking some kind of security question.

### If you're doing ""degen"" stuff, make sure to have guardians who can respond quickly. Otherwise, this doesn't matter

If you're doing degen stuff with on-chain contracts, you may need to act quickly: pull money out if a contract gets a vulnerability, move money around if you are close to being liquidated, etc. If your needs include this, then you want to find guardians who can act quickly on short notice (and therefore also, guardians in different time zones, so enough guardians to complete a transaction are awake at all times) to protect your funds. If you do not do these kinds of things, however, then speed is not particularly important, and in fact may even be slightly harmful, because convincing people of the need to act urgently is a common social engineering tactic used by hackers and it can be good to have people who are by default mentally averse to that.

### Test each guardian at least once a year

Make a test operation at least once a year. Ideally, make two test operations each year, using half your guardians for one and the other half of your guardians for the other. This makes sure that your guardians haven't forgotten or lost their accounts.

### Advanced: privacy

One of the challenges with guardians today is that the tech does not yet exist to make it possible to protect your financial privacy from your guardians. However, this is a technical problem that can be solved technically: instead of guarding your account directly, the guardians guard a ""lockbox"" contract where the link between your account and the lockbox is hidden. Making the link stay hidden until a recovery needs to be made is pretty easy: for example, your account could have as a guardian a CREATE2 contract that only the lockbox can create. Making the link stay hidden _even after_ a recovery, however, requires more advanced ZK-SNARK tech. Hence, this is a problem that I expect will slowly be solved over the next few years.",Maleficent_Plankton,20,11,0.68
325,I'm glad I didn't give up last year,11tjyg7,"I know we're still not in some crazy bull market yet but it's almost unbelievable to me seeing us pumping up this high. These are prices that seemed unattainable after how low we got. 2022 was a tough year, and seeing my portfolio continuously take a hit was mentally draining. I started investing in 2021 so I had no experience on how to navigate a bear market. There were moments where I got frustrated or sad but I kept DCAing into Bitcoin regardless. Got myself a hardware wallet after reading about victims of Mt. Gox and previous exchanges that went under (thankful for past me doing that) and hunkered down on buying every week regardless of whatever happened. Then FTX's collapse came near the end of the year and we saw Bitcoin drop to 16k. At that point I was looking at a purely down chart and my portfolio was hit even more. Thankfully I didn't put my crypto on anywhere like Celsius or FTX but seeing it down so much hurt. Is it over? Was this effort all for nothing?

I'm thankful I didn't give up. For the first time I'm able to see some unrealized profit from my Bitcoin buys last year.

326,Up we go again!,11tjfim,"Bitcoin pushing past $25k and very close to past $26k is a lovely thing to wake up to, can’t help feeling that the current events in the USA and the Credit Suisse situation have fuelled a flight into crypto on some level, especially the US bank failures and obvious subsequent bail outs by the US government. I think this current scenario that we are seeing play out is more significant for crypto than many of us realise - this is the first time we are seeing a narrative form for the mainstream that traditional banking systems are not as safe as we have all been led to believe and that crypto, whilst still in its infancy is a real option for wealth storing instead of the banks. 
If Bitcoin can rise through this period and establish itself away from just tracking the US markets could we see a full disconnect from it tracking the Dow/SPX ?

328,How to store crypto SAFELY? giving out the best advices from my 4yrs of never getting hacked experience!,11t60c1,"I work in Customer support for three years and four years so far in crypto. Seeing a lot of people getting hacked with big chunks is devastating and begs the question, Are they playing it SAFE? I don't think so. 

The ways people most likely get SCAMMED - 

1. Fake customer support/airdrop/wallet recovery phishing site 


2. Connecting wallet with a Fake Dapp/mining site/investment platform.


3. Through social engineering - mobile hacks, note hacks, file hacks, mail hacks, etc.


Let's find out the best way to avoid these and keep your crypto safe. 


1. DO NOT hold large chunks in hot wallets ( anything above $10K deserves a hardware wallet). 


2. DO NOT use the same wallet for holding and dapp connections. Use separate wallets for separate purposes.


3. DO NOT interact with a Dapp/nft minting/ airdrop site without doing proper research. 


4. DO NOT hold all coins in one wallet. Spread among exchange and different wallets like ledger, Trust wallet, metamask, Citadel, Exodus, or any other industry-established wallets.


5. DO NOT use the same seed phrase in different wallets.


6. DO NOT hold seed phrase on a notepad, keypad, or something. Keeping offline is BEST with some change in the seed which can only be cracked by you. 


7. DO NOT share seed phrase with anybody, anywhere nor even support will ask for it.


8. DO NOT download unpopular crypto games, or earning apps on your device.


9. Do NOT open random doc files on your device. 


10. DO NOT use mining dapps. 


11. Always keep your wallet app locked.


12. Always remove approval of random dapp after connecting to it. 


13. Always write down seed in two different places. 


14. Always stay away from show offing your funds to near persons. 


15. Always follow the above-mentioned things.


16. Always remember nobody cares if you get hacked. Don't have fake hope of getting assets back.

Tuesday’s CPI data shows that J.Pow might just have to hike the fed rates yet another 50-75bps next week. We’ve all seen how the rising interest rates have strained banks with SVB’s recent failure (hence the bankruns and the crypto/gold pumps).

The way I see it, this could go one of two ways:

1. Rates get hiked (as they should): potentially more banks fail, and people find safe haven in crypto
2. J.Pow pulls the rug to save the rich: we fall into recession, crypto dumps, and fiat becomes even more worthless (and I don’t get to buy eggs again this year)

336,"Keys, keys, keys",11tdrxr,"I've always been confused about the different types of keys, mnemonics, addresses that one can have in crypto. Recently I've been educating myself on the topic. Here's a summary of the differences between these terms, along with the number of keys or addresses that can be generated from each one:

* **Seed phrase:** A string of words used to generate a master key. An unlimited number of accounts, private keys, public keys, and addresses can be generated from a single seed phrase.
* **Master key:** A top-level key derived from the seed phrase. An unlimited number of accounts, private keys, public keys, and addresses can be generated from a single master key.
* **Account key:** A key derived from the master key, used to generate a distinct set of private keys, public keys, and addresses for a specific account. An unlimited number of private keys, public keys, and addresses can be generated from a single account key.
* **Private key:** A secret key used to sign transactions and access cryptocurrency funds. A single private key corresponds to a single public key and a single cryptocurrency address.
* **Public key:** A key derived from a private key, used to receive cryptocurrency funds. A single public key corresponds to a single cryptocurrency address.
* **Address:** A unique identifier used to receive and send cryptocurrency funds. A single cryptocurrency address corresponds to a single public key and a single private key.

In summary, the seed phrase and master key can be used to generate an unlimited number of accounts, private keys, public keys, and addresses. Each account key can generate an unlimited number of private keys, public keys, and addresses. Each private key corresponds to a single public key and a single cryptocurrency address.

It is in your interest to persevere fiat and kill crypto. 

You also quickly realize that trying to shutdown all crypto projects is a fool’s errand as there are thousands of them in different buckets - defi, NFTs, stablecoins, etc. So you set out to make your job easier and destroy faith in crypto and the rest will fall. To do this, you decide to destroy or limit the influence of Bitcoin. If you can take down the original crypto, surely faith in everything else will vanish. 

What you (the government) have done so far:

Go after the crypto-friendly banks. Increase interest rates. This will indirectly cause bank runs. Seize the banks, reassure depositors will be made whole again but those pesky investors are on the hook for their loss. Slowly continue waging war on crypto-friendly banks. 

Future campaigns:

1. Monetary - Tax the hell out of crypto. 30% is for chumps. Raise it to 60-70% on crypto capital gains. And only do it for crypto, stocks are your friends. Software like TurboTax have already separated the two out for you nicely, the groundwork has already been laid. 

This will break the backs of crypto investors. Some won’t report their crypto profits (or losses, who are we kidding!). But if they’ve already reported their crypto activity in past years, we’ll they’re not so anonymous now. You have their wallet addresses. 

2. Access - shutdown crypto exchanges. For all of the talk of “decentralized”, let’s be honest most crypto users have their money on exchanges. Not you keys, not your coins. You won’t get those who have their assets on cold wallets, but those are in the minority. Also shutdown ledger sellers. That’ll make it hard for new users to have cold storages. 

The more technically competent crypto users will not be affected by this. But it will slow down or even freeze adoption since crypto adoption relies on the mass less technically savvy public to have easy interfaces to work with crypto. 

So there you have it. That’s what the government is doing or will probably do in the future to try to kill crypto. 

It is in our interest, those of us who want to see mass crypto adoption one day, to think of these possible roadblocks and try to find solutions for them.

Unlike traditional crypto that most people are familiar with, like BTC and ETH, where you have complete control of your coins (your keys, your coins), USDC and USDT do not share this same feature. 

USDC and USDT can be frozen at will from the company issuing those stable coins. So practically its like saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" when holding them. So in the event that they are legally required or feel its in the best interest, they can freeze your funds in whatever wallet those coins are held in, and can make them wortless while issuing new coins to replace them. This is good news for exchanges when they get hacked, but also bad news for anyone who wants 100% control over their crypto.

So just remember that even if the stable coin is guaranteed 1:1, you could possibly still fall victim to a frozen account for whatever reason they find necessary.",tranceology3,30,8,0.66

345,"Banks are a solution to an artificial problem they themselves created, to control civilians.",11tapx6,"I'm seeing some posts and comments talking about the banking system, especially from the events that got unfolded during the last 2 weeks. 🏦 **Banks  are trending.**

By my opinion, people have a very short memory and are debating that crypto enthusiasts should not talk negative about the banking system, as we need it to by crypto with their debit cards, and we need them to cash out.

Well, we are using a lot of staff and we are doing a lot of things that we see them as negatives, but we have no other choice, cause this is how the civilization is directed atm, but that didn't stop as to call their BS as it is. Banks are just being used to control civilians, in a very effective way. Banks have no trustworthiness, as many times showed, they give 0 shit about people's money. I can remember just few instances on top of my head, without searching the web, how it was used for political control or how the depositors money just disappeared:

* Dissolution of USSR - all depositors money was gone
* Cyprus, banking crisis - they took 6-10% from the depositors for their banks bail out
* Canada, track drivers protest - they blocked supporters bank accounts
* Russia - Ukraine ""war"" - Russian's reserves frozen, Russian citizens money frozen in western banks
* China, bank run - took depositors money, tanks stopped the protest
* Silicon Valley bank collapse - yeah, whatever that is

And this is one of the biggest BS ever:

346,Passive income through crypto.,11tapww,"A lot of people are holding crypto or buying crypto with the hope that it will appreciate in value greatly and they can retire. 

It seems simple and has worked in the past: If you bought $1000 worth Bitcoin 10 years ago it would be worth over $500,000 today. [Using the Bitcoin time machine you can compare to some other investments as well.](https://imgur.com/a/RqkNwtU)

However past results do not always guarantee future results and the question often asked is ""How big can the crypto market cap get?"" If you are pessimistic you might think it cannot grow much further. So how to profit off crypto?

One method is to use the various forms of passive income that the crypto space offers.  

There are several ways to earn passive income through cryptocurrencies and here are some of the most common ones:


**Yield farming**: Yield farming is a way to earn interest on your cryptocurrency holdings by lending them out to other users on a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. The interest rate varies depending on the platform and the cryptocurrency you lend, but yield farming can be a lucrative way to earn passive income. It's worth learning about impermanence loss as this is not a risk free way of earning money. 

**Masternodes**: Masternodes are servers that support the blockchain network and provide additional functions, such as instant transactions, privacy features, and decentralized governance. By running a masternode, you can earn rewards in the form of cryptocurrency. However they normally take a large amount of capital to set up. If you had a lot of money already you might want to find a safer form of investing. 

**Dividends** : 
Some cryptocurrencies offer dividends to their holders. Dividends are typically paid out as a percentage of the network's transaction fees or revenue. Examples of cryptocurrencies that offer dividends include NEO, Vechain, and Kucoin. Not much to say about this, similar to dividend investing on the stock market.

   **Staking**: Staking involves holding a certain amount of cryptocurrencies in a wallet or exchange to support the network's security and transaction verification. By doing this, you can earn rewards in the form of more coins. Staking can be done with several cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Cardano, and Polkadot. Staking can be tricky and you should be aware that when the price of the original coin goes down you can still be losing money while staking. Also there are some coins with insane APR's and they generally turn out to be scams. 


**Airdrops**: Airdrops are free distributions of cryptocurrencies to holders of a particular token or coin. Airdrops are typically used to promote a new cryptocurrency or reward existing holders. I'll add faucets under this heading as well. In the early days of bitcoin people were literally giving away whole coins!

**Crypto mining**: Mining involves using computational power to solve complex mathematical problems that verify transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain. By mining cryptocurrencies, you can earn rewards in the form of more coins. Depending on your set up though you might end up spending more money on power then you earn in crypto. Also takes some capital to start as well. 

I hope this is informative. Have i missed any passive forms?",BigJimBeef,163,5,0.56
347,Good development teams of cryptocurrencies projects should NOT be visionaires.,11taohy,"Greetings from Portugal.

Crypto companies have been hiring a lot of employees to diversify their businesses and make the best of the opportunity during bull market. That's also the reason we saw a lot of job cuts during bear market and increased pressure from investors.

Cryptocurrency development requires a deep understanding of technical details. **While visionaries may have great ideas for how the technology could be used, they may not have the technical expertise to actually develop a functional cryptocurrency.**

And trying to have a multi ideia team would increase costs and elevate the dificult of execution. This could ultimately lead to a stagnant project that fails to meet the needs of its users.

So, that's why in my opinion the leadership of a project must be more focus on the pratical execution and less worried about inovation.

I would love to ear the community thoughts on this!

348,Why I think it may be safer and more worthwhile to put your crypro in exchange sometimes.,11taao9,"Firstly, When I want to withdraw my crypto, the exchange I used asked for app password, hardware authenticator, and phone otp. Then sent a email to me. And before that you need to create withdrawal white list for the account you are sending to.
While I heard of people losing tens of thousand easily when people access their seed phase to their wallet.
And I won't lose access to my crypto on exchange  like I would when I lost my seed phase of my non custodian wallet. As my exchange account is tied to my identity, my email, my hardware authenticator and phone number beside the password.
I could also earn a decent interest rate with the cryto exchange earn program.
So do you agree that if we could find 
reputable and good exchanges, it would be relatively more efficient and safer to put 50% of our cryto investment into the exchange? Or why not?

edit- i put on a viewpoint for discussion which you all know that many people that are only in cryptocurrency with a small amount just for liquidity are thinking of and i got downvote until the upvote rate is 47% for this whole post. This is an example of polarization of viewpoints.",possibili-teas,152,0,0.45
349,How concerned are you with recent SEC's take on Proof of Stake?,11t9tf8,"By now, you all are aware of SEC aka Uncle Gary's ""recommendation"" to treat all Proof-of-Stake chains as Securities. This can trigger a lot of unnecessary poking into various projects. Unfortunately, every major chain except Bitcoin is PoS so the scale of this disruption is non-trivial.

The optimistic side of me wants to believe that all SEC/Gary wants is to create better policy/ regulatory framework for these blockchains so that bad actors can't mess up with investors (especially Retail investors) but if history were a reference, none of us like the case of Ripple/ XRP -  once a shiny toy of Crypto world, now dragging its feet in the dust with SEC.

It's less about the downside risk of project success, it's more the unfortunate dragging year after year that kills the interest in dev community and momentum. A lot of these major chains are still very early (except Ethereum, maybe) so an SEC intervention/ poking can really hurt them.

Time will tell what happens next but I don't have a good feeling about where it's headed. Probably there is something to be done by these Blockchains to not add any fuel to Gary's fire but I think it would take two to tango and SEC needs to act believing that retail investors do want these projects to succeed, not at the risk of being scammed, but by taking measured risks and methodology to innovate and grow.

On a separate note, this will place more trust and confidence in Bitcoin and smart contracts built on it so probably that's blessing in disguise, or may be even a bull flag for BTC pending some macro relief/ stimulus.

350,What's the best way to convert cash to Bitcoin?,11t9rv6,"I would Google this, but I think I have a better chance of getting the right answer here.

Everyone here knows that cash is a diminishing asset and that converting it to a form of crypto is a much better way to accumulate wealth. That being said, theoretically, if there was someone that accumulated a lot of cash through the years and now wants to convert it to Bitcoin how would said person do so?

Depositing into a bank and buying Bitcoin is probably the easiest way, but over a certain amount the IRS is bound to start asking questions.

352,"With banks now trying to limit how much you can spend on digital assets, we need to pay attention even more",11t93rb,"Banks are trying to stop retail from pulling their own fiat from their grasp to stop a bank run.  This will cause further liquidity issues at banks, yet shows exactly how irresponsible banks are due to their fraction reserve philosophy, which should be criminal, in that it is lending out money they do not have.  Yet, somehow since its banks and they can’t fail, its allowed?

The exact reasoning they are trying to limit withdraws for crypto related activity is because crypto such as bitcoin is a competitor to what banks are.  Storing your money.  When bitcoin, in a digital wallet, in your pocket is just as good if not better due to future valuations.  

By setting limitations, banks are proving exactly why bitcoin was created in the first place.  Everyone deserves financial independence and banks locking your money in their control should just speed up adoption, even though they are trying to accomplish the exact opposite.

Saying it now, buy as much as you can now while you are still able too before further limitations come into effect.  It’s obvious banks and governments are terrified of crypto with recent events.  They will stop at nothing to retain absolute control.

Right now its limits, next week its a complete block temporarily to “stabilize financial markets and trust”, and next month it will be entirely locked out of on ramping through banks.  Then exchanges themselves will face harsh regulation and shut down one by one.  This could just be the start and traditional financial markets will all fight together coordinated to destroy bitcoin.

353,How do you protect your crypto?,11t8snn,"I personally have a hardware wallet which is password protected and a back up on a micro SD card stored in a fire proof safe. I do not have a seed phrase. Does the seed phrase add an additional level of security to the hardware wallet?

I'm assuming there are still a lot of people that leave their crypto on exchanges which I think is the riskiest of options. Still that is one step better than not owning crypto. I'd call this level 1.

I think I'm a level 2, I've taken my crypto off the exchange and it can now only be accessed via a hardware wallet. I'm sure there are far more secure ways that I will graduate to and I've started doing some research on them.

354,"Fidelity is the first follower of the nutty Crypto lone dancer, here is your hopium for the day.",11t8huv,"As far as I know, the first reputable and trusted investment platform to open up crypto trading to the US public is Fidelity. I see them as the first follower of the crazy lone dancer at a festival who starts a movement, as explained in this [YouTube video about leadership lessons from dancing guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ). In this analogy, Robinhood is the crazy dancing guy because no serious investor trusts them.

According to the video, a leader needs the courage to stand alone and look ridiculous, but what they're doing should be simple enough to follow. That's where the first follower comes in with a crucial role: publicly showing everyone how to follow. The leader embraces the first follower as an equal, and it becomes about them as a group. It takes guts to be the first follower, as you stand out and risk ridicule yourself. However, being a first follower is an under-appreciated form of leadership because the first follower transforms a lone nut into a leader. The second follower is a turning point because it proves the first follower has done well. Now it's not just a lone nut or two, it's a crowd, and that's when a movement becomes public.

In the case of crypto trading, we're now seeing the start of an actual movement, just in time for the next halving bull run. More and more people are jumping in, and as they do, it becomes less risky to join. Those who were on the fence before have no reason not to join now. Eventually, those who prefer to be part of the crowd will join, so they won't be ridiculed for not doing so.

In summary, Fidelity is the first follower in the crypto trading movement, and we're seeing the start of a larger movement as more people join in, especially with all the banking woes happening currently.",techsupport261,11,5,0.69

One year ago all the talk was about LUNA‘s UST which was meant to be a game-changer, we all know how that ended…

But however, the year 2022 was the year of the Stabelcoins boom as over $15B of stablecoins were added that year alone to the exchanges, with the peak being $45B worth of stablecoins on exchanges alone. The peak of it being just before the FTX collapse in November 2022.

It is true that stablecoins will always be a part of Crypto and especially they are needed in DeFi, I was also once on an other opinion but realised that this is much more true.

Is it that difficult to understand that crypto market cap needs to go higher than 3TR and BTC going to 100K to have the purchasing power that previous ATH meant at that time?

TLTR: crypto prices need to go significantly higher than previous ATH to offer you the same purchasing power that it did at the last time ATH.  100K would be the new 69K BTC.

368,A physical wallet is NOT the same thing as a cold wallet. A physical wallet will not mitigate your losses from scams and user errors.,11t4r7g,"**Hardware wallets have limited protection**

One thing in common among all the whale attacks mentioned recently in this sub is that none of them used a **cold wallet**. By keeping all their funds in a single active wallet, they lost everything at once.

A few of them used **hardware wallets**, but they still lost all their crypto. Even with a hardware wallet. You can still lose everything by:

* Getting scammed
* Interacting with a bad website
* Signing a bad transaction
* Setting unlimited approval, followed by a dApp hack.

These all user errors, and no hardware wallet will protect you from that. But if you kept the majority of your crypto in cold wallets, your damage would've been severely limited by the smaller amount kept in the hot wallet. The only thing a cold wallet will not protect against is if your whole computer or phone is compromised by malware.

**Follow the best security practices of good Centralized Exchanges (like Coinbase, not FTX): Their cold wallets only interact with their hot wallets.**

**There is a huge misconception that cold wallets and hardware wallets are the same thing. They're not!**

Cold wallets often use hardware wallets and gain even more protection with them. But hardware wallets can also be used to protect hot wallets. 

**If you want full protection, you need to have BOTH a hardware wallet and a cold wallet.**

A lot of media and hardware wallet sites (\*cough\* Ledger) have tried to dilute definitions by misleading customers into thinking that hardware wallets are the same thing as cold wallets. But legit sources like the Ethereum website, Metamask, Consensys, and Alchemy will never say this.

**Origin of the terms**

""Hot"" and ""Cold"" originate from hot and cold storage in IT Security. Hot storage is actively used. Cold storage is for archival data, kept elsewhere, and **not used except for backup recoveries.** You make backup tapes from hot storage, and then transfer them to a cold storage location like Iron Mountain.

A proper cold wallet uses the security principles from cold storage. Send funds from your hot wallet to the cold wallet. Only use the cold wallet if you need to take out some funds for use, and only send to the hot wallet. And whenever you use the cold wallet, double-check the transfer address and make sure you're using a malware-free computer or phone.

**The proper definitions from the UC Berkeley cryptocurrency course**:

* **Hot**: Any wallet you actively use. If you transfer to other accounts not owned by you or interacts with dApps, it's a hot wallet, even if you store the physical 
* **Cold**: A wallet that's used to hold the majority of your funds
* **Software wallet**: Seed is stored in a software client, encrypted by your password
* **Physical wallet**: Seed is stored in a physical device and air-gapped from the software client. Requires a software client.",FluffayPenguin,59,27,0.81
369,Defitaxes.us -- a website to do your defi taxes for free.,11t4047,"https://defitaxes.us

This is a website I made to help process your blockchain taxes. I posted this in r/CryptoTax before. I've been working on this cumulatively for about a year and a half now; at this point this is the best available tool to do your defi taxes (other tools are better for CEX). It is 100% free, and supports up to 50K transactions/wallet (10K on Solana).

It will NOT automatically process everything for you. It will try to make reasonable guesses about what kind of transactions you performed, and will also give you an estimate of how certain it is. It WILL occasionally be wrong. Your input is required to correctly classify many of your transactions, and there are tools to do it in a reasonable amount of time even if you have thousands of transactions (extremely ballpark estimate: 1 hour of work per 300 transactions or so, once you familiarize yourself with the available tools).

Centralized exchanges are supported via CSV uploads, you'll need to convert exchange history to my CSV format (same as cryptotaxcalculator's format). There are kits for coinbase, binance, bittrex, kraken, kucoin to help you convert.

&nbsp; 


Most important features:

1) Support for 29 blockchains -- including Ethereum, Solana, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Fantom. Basically everything  Etherscan team made scanners for + all Blockscout-based scanners + Solana, straight off the RPC.

2) Counterparty recognition -- I page-scraped Etherscan&co label clouds for counterparty names (and also Solscan). What this means is in many cases I can guess who you are transacting with, which will help you identify the transactions. No competitor has this.

3) Custom types -- this to my mind is the killer feature here. If you repetitively made the same kind of transaction many times, this allows you to apply the correct tax treatment to all of them at once. For example, if you claimed reward from some shitcoin.finance a hundred times, you need exactly three clicks to apply the right tax treatment to all of those rewards: click on one of those transactions, click on ""select transactions with the same operation & counterparty"", and click on provided ""Claim reward"" custom type. No competitor has this.

4) Rebase & discrepancy detection -- my site will query debank for your balances and compare it to what it calculated. If there's a mismatch, that means it's a rebasing token. I believe only Koinly has something similar.

5) Intuitive UI -- every transaction is color-coded by how certain I am of processing it correctly.

6) It's completely free, and will stay that way until it gets some traction. Then I am planning to charge a tiny percentage of your assets.  
    
    
&nbsp; 


Biggest deficiencies -- at the moment:

1) Lack of protocol-specific support.

2) No way to import data from the other tax tools.

3) US-specific. People from other countries used it too though.
    
    
&nbsp; 


I am neck-deep in DeFi myself and this was a labor of love to make a website that can actually be used to do your taxes (I tried several competitors and found them all lacking). I've done my own taxes using it for two years now, and I've processed defi taxes for other people using it. I have several thousand transactions across a bunch of blockchains.   

Let me know what bugs and problems you encounter! And I also need help with it, let me know if interested!

1) I need a promotion guy (or gal). Someone with twitter following who can hawk this thing :) So eventually it can be a real business.

2) A second programmer to work on, basically, deficiency #1 -- churn out protocol support code so that most of our users' transactions get correctly auto-classified. There are hundreds of protocols. I just can't do it alone. Code's in python.

3) A token-maker? Maybe? I dunno.",Xirax,18,4,0.67

In my personal case, I have been  buying every week since May 2021 following a 35/35/30 DCA strategy where 35% BTC, 35% ETH and 30% alt coins like MATIC, DOT, ALGO, ADA, LINK and ATOM.

My strategy is to stop DCAing into a coin as soon as it becomes a profit bag and start accumulating Fiat for future dips or bear markets. I think that during this time I have accumulated enough coins to start accumulating Fiat to also buy things in real life like a new gaming computer.

I believe better all the crypto industry to die under heavy KYC, than people continue name shitcoins a Crypto-Currency.

Misuse Definitions is a Ultimate Sin.

But, Crypto-Currency exists. It is easy to find by simple definition matching against CoinMarketCap top chart. But outside top 10 as a hint.

373,"Crypto.com likes to pretend to offer compelling benefits for their users like ""rewards"", but...",11t3c7z,"... then find any possible way they can to weasel out of paying them.

Back story: crytpo.com (CDC hereafter) started offering ""diamonds"" to stimulate trading, because that's how they make money.  But they're really tight with paying them out. 

On my first go-round with them they didn't pay the 5 diamonds I felt I should've earned for a transaction of $20+, that was because I didn't use the daily ""unlock"", which grants you a diamonds.  Lesson learned, but they could've given a one-time concession like any normal customer service institution.  It's literally a few cents of a gesture. But instead their answer is GTFO.

Then yesterday I used a ""target"" transaction (spot trade) which they just added recently to buy $20+ worth of SNX when the price fell.  No reward, even though I did the daily unlock. I check the exception language in the UI, no mention of an exclusion for spot trades, and no links to exclusions either, even though there's plenty of real estate for either of those things.  So I contact support again and their answer is, predictably, ""RTFM, here's a link"".  Tough luck pal, beat it.

When I was poking around looking for the support link I discovered that the couple of bucks I left in my CDC debit card account got seized because I let the card go inactive.

374,Our price drops from last week may have resulted in a literally perfect retest and “re-loading time“ for Bitcoin to one day continue a rally upwards.,11t32yi,"As much as their has been doom and gloom over the past week and especially during the weekend in the anticipation of an inevitable drop today, which I also was a part of I have to admit, kind of exactly the opposite happened. Instead of going down we took off regaining previous support levels early this week and even hit a new multi-month high of $26k.

And now looking back we may realize that this dump from the past week has been the PERFECT retest of support and resistance on the BTC price chart.

[Chart Analysis from BigCheds on Twitter, 13th March but it still holds true](https://preview.redd.it/4uzqlql2f5oa1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=78ea06336f057977dcb65469927c1ca0fb9b8d01)

This chart analysis from an analyst on Twitter shows how we perfectly bounced off the Weekly Moving Average 20 (blue) and now even regained the Daily Moving Average 50 (green) which has been a crucial support during our previous rally.

Also we regained crucial support horizontal areas of $22k, then the $23.9k support and now are looking to hold pretty solid support at $24k+. 

All of the current drop was also pretty expectable as we could clearly see how BTC was struggling at the $25k mark and now the banking crisis gave a good reason for a deep flush out of longs and now of shorts too. Because remember that all markets want to do is to equally liquidate longs and shorts. The runaway may now be “clearer“ for BTC to take off.",partymsl,24,6,0.66
375,How people earn money with Crypto,11t2kdv,"Hello guys.

I already saw many people here which asked how other people earn money with Crypto. Long story short. There are several ways to make money in Crypto Space.  
 

**First**: Trading (dex, cex, wallets)   
This is the most common way to get money. As long as people respect the rules :D Buy low! Sell high! (I know most of us use the other rule: by high, sell low)  
   
**Second**: mining (wallet, special software)   
Above all, this requires good hardware and a lot of investment... In my opinion, mining is not for newcomers... But OGs still make good profits!  
 

**Third**: Staking (dex, cex, wallets, project websites)   
As staking becomes more and more popular, good money can be made from it. In my opinion, one of the greatest things about staking is that you get paid with the coin/token you stake. Let's do an example of why I love staking! Cardano. Started in 2017. We all know what happened after the 2017-2018 bull run. All coins went to hell!   
Also ada went from 2018 ATH ($1.10) to 2020 ATL ($0.03).   
   
Here's the trick of staking. If you (some people I know have) bought 33k ADA for $1000 priced at $0.03. You invested $1000 at an APY of 0.05% = $50 per year (or 1.6k ADA).  
 

Now that's $0.3. That means first. Your $1,000 investment is worth $9.9k. In addition, your rewards have also increased in value. You still get 1.6k ada per year. But these Ada aren't worth $50 anymore, they're worth $480 a year. That means your APY of your initial investment is now almost 50%! (Whoever was smart and sold their Ada at ATH could do much better. But we're just looking at staking here)   
   
There are several other coins that have gone the same way.  
 

Note: Different coins and tokens use different types of staking. Some coins/tokens you need to send somewhere when staking. For other coins, you can keep the coins in your wallet and stake them in the safest way!

**Fourth**: Lending (On dex, cex) When borrowing, 10% APY is common. Again, you get the rewards in the coin/token you borrow. Sometimes other coins too.  
 

**Fifth**: Providing Liquidity Mining (on Dex and Project websites) You need a pair of tokens for this. You provide the liquidity on dexes that people use for their switches. Depending on how many people are providing liquidity, the APY can start above 1000% (rare for good coins) and something between 10% and 40% APY is normal.  
 

This APY seems to be quite high. But beware! The permanent loss could destroy your income! When your coin pair increases steadily. You can withdraw as many coins as you originally provided. But if a coin is more successful. You get less of the winning coin and more of the other coin. Here's a great example I have: SAND/ETH (no longer available) If you've bought SAND for less than $0.05 in the past... you've provided liquidity to SAND/ETH. Sand performed much better than ETH. In this case, you received less SAND when you closed the pair, but a lot more ETH. In the end the price in $ would be higher if you only have the SAND left. BUT while providing liquidity you also earned some SAND to sell. And getting more ETH is allways good!  
 

Liquid mining is perhaps the most complicated thing. But in my opinion it is a great way to earn passive income. As said, inform yourself about theimpermanent loss.  
 

**Sixth**: NFT flipping (project websites, NFT trading websites)   
This is almost the same as trading coins/tokens. You see, there are many ways to make money. In my opinion, trading is only good for experienced people. I prefer the passive income route. Like staking, lending and liquidity mining!

&#x200B;

All you have to do is do your research before committing to anything! Get as much information as possible. The usual risks of hacks, fraud and so on are real! Always think twice before you act! This is definitely NOT financial advice! Everyone is responsible for their own investment. I am NOT a financial advisor!",BriBumer,24,2,0.6

One of them is looking at our monthly candle chart. Here we can see how we are just on the brink of having a 3rd consecutive green month. Obviously half of the month is still left but a close above $23.1k would guarantee it, which seem very likely currently.

Another very interesting fact is that if you just take ANY three consecutive green candles, you will realize that there has never been ‘just‘ three green months but always at least four green months.

* Enable app based 2FA like Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
* NEVER store seed phrases or Recovery keys for 2FA in whatever device that can be connected online. ALWAYS store it offline like in two paper notebooks.
* Use passwords managers like Bitwarden Open Source Password Manager.
* NEVER share your seed phrase.
* Use Brave browser which includes an integrated AdBlock to avoid Google Ads phishing sites.
* Always verify that the software are you downloading comes from the original website.
* Don't trust SMS or Emails, always check things from the original website.
* Control your greed. Greed is the principal reason that leads people to make mistakes and fall into scammers.

384,"Storing Your Seed Phrase (give me a better idea, I beg)",11t0j05,"Obviously, there are a lot of opinions on how to store your seed phrase. It’s a general fact that taking a screenshot or keeping it in a file (probably named “seed phrase”) is a a bad idea, because a lot of software scans for that type of stuff. 

Some people write down their seed phrase on paper. Nice and secure right? Old school, no one can hack it. But then if you loose it or there’s a fire, there goes your crypto. To solve that, I actually have it written down and stored on two separate pieces of paper in two different houses. But even then, people say it decays over time, I’ve heard stories of the ink running and blurring to the point it was unreadable and their crypto was lost. 

Some have a better idea. Carve it into a slab of metal. Fire proof, water proof, generally wear and tear proof. Good luck destroying that. But not gonna lie that sounds expensive and where do I even go for that? 

I’ve come up with an idea that I’m not sure is great at all, but beyond carving it into a block of literal metal idk what else there is. What about an unmarked file (password protected) that contains a paragraph or long-ass sentence. You memorise that every x words makes up your seed phrase, so to anyone else it just looks like junk and there’s no way to know it’s a seed OR the combo.

If someone found your seed phrase do they need a ledger to gain access to your crypto or can they access it somewhere way.

I'm just wondering if people buy a device and that device is no longer sold or goes out of business are you screwed again this is probably a dumb noob question.

387,Vault access issue desktop vs. mobile,11t0255,"Not sure if anyone has heard of this problem or not but I'll share my dilemma. I'll preface this by saying that I've done a fair amount of digging around in old posts to see if there are similar issues but nothing 100% definitive. 

First of all I only use Reddit on desktop, never mobile and in fact I had never even installed the app on my phone before. I received a couple of those custom avatars (like the NFL one) and claimed it but directly via the desktop app since that's all I use. After reading several posts here about setting up your vault for moons, I decided I should probably do that (not that I'm flush with moons). So I download the mobile app and sign in and when I go to the Vault it says that one already exists under my username and it asks for a password and/or a recovery phrase but the problem is, I never set one up. Like, never. I'm accustomed to using recovery phrases and quite seriously store those securely, so if I were to set up a recovery phrase, I would have it. From what I found in past posts it seems like the only place I could have set up a vault would have been on mobile, but since I never even had the mobile app installed, then how can one exist?

Could this be a bug? Is it possible that by accepting custom avatar via desktop a vault was created but because desktop isn't yet designed to create the vault password & recovery phrase the user never sees that option? I could be wrong but I think my only current choice might be to overwrite the vault and lose any current moons I have? (I'm less concerned about the avatar)",misterjoego,25,3,0.72

389,"Crypto is not as risky as people say, just most people are totally irresponsible and broke all basic security rules.",11szgc9,"Imagine having home with guard dogs, cameras, security,  with a steel door only you and no one else can open and then you leave the door open, fire security and close dogs in a cage... Whose fault would it be if someone would break into your open home and stole everything? Only yours. But you would still blame security company, guy that sold you dogs or shop that sold you cameras. And then said ""fuck homes"", I will live in scyscraper or a hotel again,  they will care of everything for me.

That's exactly how people behave in crypto, they have access to MOST SECURE tool on earth to protect their money and still lose it.... Banks or exchanges can get hacked or went bankrupt, but your wallet can't. 100% safe unless you use some shady wallet, but then it is only your fault. It is literally IMPOSSIBLE to hack your crypto from wallet without your seedphrase. If you menage to get scammed out of it like last fool you can only blame the guy you see in the mirror every morning.

All scams, phishing links, connecting wallet to random site are users fault. Not problem with crypto. Crypto is a tool, you are the person that use the tool. If you  do something stupid you can't blame crypto only yourself. Send your crypto from exchange to software or even better hardware wallet. Stop opening unknown links  or using your main wallet for shitcoins or to connect it for random sites. Wrote down your seedphrase on paper or metal plate. How hard it is? It is not, that it the basics every newbie should know. If you do it your crypto will be 100% safe ( unless someone stole your seedphrase irl, but that much more unlikely than online attack).

Stop playing a victim, in crypto you have full responsibility over your money. No one control it, but also no one can help you if you fuck up. That's why you should always be careful and double check everything. But if you will do it you will never have to see your wallet drained or anything like that.",Nuewim,131,78,0.69

391,Does the interest in cryptos impact our personality negatively?,11syutt,"So  I had a long discussion with one of my best childhood friends about the  moral of investing in cryptos. We both started working a few months ago  and for the first time in our lives we got money in our bank.

I  mainly invest in Btc/Eth/Moons and told him about it, because I truly  believe that cryptos will be a big part in our daily lives in the next  10-20 years.

He kinda raged about  the bad stuff going on with cryptos like scams, energy wasting from  mining, money laundry and so on and asked me how cryptos tribute  anything good to our world. I told him about donations to Ukraine or  Turkey and the possibility of fighting inflation in poor countries.

At  this point he answered that I could just fight these problems without  crypto. With spending my time on investing and reading about crypto I  would be just another part of a profit horney movement. He truly thought  the interest in cryptos will negatively impact my character.

I can understand some of his arguments and fears. But on the other side I think the crypto world is truly fascinating.

I see many replies here stating that they are on a long-term holding path, and I'm interested in what made you quit trading for good. Did you realise that TA was bullshit? Or was it because of the huge market volatility? 

I hope I have been into crypto at the beginning of the last bull run. Back then, you could make money by just buying whatever is trending on Crypto Twitter and selling it for profit within a short timeframe. I did it myself with Matic and Sand to state a few, and was successful.

 Basically, it seems trading is way easier when btc has a good momentum and everyone is bullish. Do you agree with this theory?",Sylerb,213,39,0.77
393,"Squid Game Token - Here's a blast from the past, well, the not so long ago past",11sxwhw,"**About one and a half years ago we witnessed the launch and rugpull of $SQUID or SquidGameToken based on the TV show Squid Game, with the scammers taking over $3.3M worth of assets.**

It was certainly a very interesting time, while the mighty bullrun was raging on at that time and meme/shit coins were being created left and right faster than you could purchase them.

The popularity of meme coins like *Shiba Inu* and *Dogecoin* with no utility but massive returns helped the token gain a following as investors are always on the lookout for the next 10,000x gains.

[Player 456 desperately looking for life changing gains](https://preview.redd.it/m17wuskyx3oa1.jpg?width=743&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d73137958e41d5499b4fc692487dd1a4e1f1f77)

One token took the spotlight for a little while all thanks to the hype surrounding the TV show Squid Game, however the coin was in no way defenitely not affiliated with the Netflix show.

# Let's take a little look at what happened back than:

*Within a couple days it amassed more than 57,000 followers and it's Telegram channel had more than 71,000 subscribers.*

The token was launched on the Binance Smart chain on the 26th of October 2021 and after an interesting run of 6 days, the value of a *Squid Coin* rose by more than **23 million percent**, from a little more than a mere cent to **$2,861.80**, and than back to almost **Zero.**

[Squid Coin - typical rug pull chart](https://preview.redd.it/df1kzo9sa4oa1.jpg?width=632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c69907c81de494f3e8b7c232887bec379206285b)

***On the 1th November of 2021 the scammer deployed a un-verified malicious smart contract, essentially rugging all those 'poor investors.'***

[Deployment of malicious smart contract](https://preview.redd.it/mmceiyq0z3oa1.jpg?width=599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e83c7391b57fa456c8aa15db990c23d16ac44c80)

**BscScan** located the wallets being associated with the *Squid Game* scam [here](https://bscscan.com/address/0x71d934aa2119ca3995f702f075d540f7a6b0f728). As you can see here the scammers swapped their **BNB** in batches of 100 and later sent it **Tornado** to steal the money of over **40,000** investors.

**Shortly after this the scammers came with the following explanation:**

[Bullshit explanation](https://preview.redd.it/w10eoxl7e4oa1.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ec694e7c18acdf9fb419261e33efed493df8b9ed)

**But the pain for many  investors could have been avoided, while it was launched it was almost clear from the beginning that $SQUID was a scam with a huge amount of 'red flags', but that didn't stop anybody from throwing money at it.**

# Red flags:

How could you see if *Squid Coin* was a scam? Well, you could put real money into the Cryptocurrency, but there was absolutely no evidence you could ever take it out.

**Just a couple 'red flags' pointed out:**

* The token’s creators wrote in an investment white paper, strewn with grammatical errors, saying that their games do not 'provide deadly consequences.'

You can read the original white paper [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20211031215905/http://squidgame.cash/SquidGameWhitepaper.pdf) using the 'Wayback Machine.

* Emails sent to Squid’s developers could not be delivered early that Tuesday.
* *CoinMarketCap*, a data provider, had urged potential traders to take **'extreme caution'** after Squid buyers told the platform that their coins could not be sold.
* The website for the *Squid Game* crypto even includes a fake endorsement from billionaire Elon Musk, who hasn’t endorsed the cryptocurrency token, but instead was talking about the Netflix show.

You can look at the archived website [here](https://archive.md/nF8hP).

# What now?

Back in 2021 a spokesperson of **Binance** accounced that their team launched an investigation, but to this day nothing has been recovered yet.

[Statement from Binance](https://preview.redd.it/gtkiigzqf4oa1.jpg?width=672&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=03c6ec7b292912058c0d45f99679dafd6c78d416)

Somehow the token is still being traded and bought to daily according to [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/squid-game/eur) and [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/squid-game/). At this point throwing money in this Token is based on pure speculation and a complete gamble but be very wary with this because the scammers could come back anytime and steal the rest of investors money!

*These types of scam projects have become all too common in the DeFi space as speculative crypto investors seeking the next ‘moon shot’ are quick to invest in projects without doing the appropriate due diligence.*

394,"There are a bunch of people kicking themselves for not buying USDC for a massive payday, but many did exactly that with Terra-USD...",11sybx1,"There was clear uncertainty in the market when SVB collapsed. USDC depegged all the way down to about $0.87 at it lowest I believe. It then recovered to around $0.93-$0.96 and stood there for a good while. That was actually really interesting because the price drop represented fairly well the 7-8% loss of funds stuck in SVB.

But when it was depegged, there were for sure a bunch of people saying it was a sure-fire profit if you bought USDC. Some said quite the opposite. the thing is most of us on the sub were around when Terra collapsed and know very well the ridiculous bets some people made. Some bought on leverage when Terra fell to $0.70. Some took the bet all the way at $0.09-0.10 for a big payout. But it was a terrible decision for those people.

Yes, *technically*, you have a 50% chance of winning. *Fundamentally*, USDC still had 90% of its reserves intact. But fundamental and technicals don't always matter in a market of irrational traders. It only takes one trader to panic, another trader to see that trade lose their composure and sell, and yet another trader who wants to doubts themself as to why those two sold...and so on. As traders says, markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

What traders mean when they say they should have bought is that they wish they could see the future. FOMO is everything it is cracked up to be.",OneThatNoseOne,298,230,0.82

396,"After exactly half a year, ETH issuance is deflationary, with a net -65,600 ETH change in supply.",11syaaa,"Had PoW continued, ETH supply would have increased at an average 3.42% per year and there would be over 2 million more ETH in circulation today. Instead it has decreased ~0.1% since the merge.

This change in supply is a big deal, an even bigger shock to the supply and demand curve than Bitcoin’s halvenings which infamously have a huge positive effect on the overall market and are seen as the catalyst of every bull run so far. My question is if we are at the beginning of another bull run (big big if), is this the first bull lead by ETH? 

The next halvening is not scheduled until 2024, and it usually takes a year or so afterwards to push Bitcoin price to new ATH. So 2025 would be the next “expected” bull run. But markets are rarely that predictable, do people think the 4-year Bitcoin led cycle will continue or could we be seeing a new boom/bust cycle?

404,Why cry when you can HODL your beer and enjoy the cryptocurrency show?,11swff5," 

Hey everyone,

If you're in the world of cryptocurrency, you know that it's not always rainbows and butterflies. Sometimes, the market can be incredibly volatile and stressful. But why cry when you can HODL your beer and enjoy the show?

Here are some funny and interesting facts about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency that will hopefully make you smile:

* The first Bitcoin transaction involved two Papa John's pizzas and was worth around 10,000 BTC. Today, that amount of Bitcoin would be worth over $500 million. Talk about inflation!
* In 2013, a man in Wales accidentally threw away a hard drive containing 7,500 Bitcoins. The Bitcoins would now be worth over $375 million. Talk about a costly mistake!
* Dogecoin, a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, was created as a joke, but it now has a market cap of over $5 billion. Who says memes can't be profitable?
* There are over 4,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, with new ones popping up all the time. It's like a never-ending game of Pokemon - gotta catch 'em all!
* Elon Musk has been known to tweet about cryptocurrency, causing the market to fluctuate wildly. It's like having a celebrity endorsement, but for finance. 
* The creator of Bitcoin, known only by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, has never been identified. It's like a real-life mystery novel!
* In 2018, a man in Norway bought $27 worth of Bitcoin in 2009 and completely forgot about it. When he remembered and checked his account in 2017, he discovered it was worth over $800,000. Talk about a lucky break!
* In 2014, the rapper 50 Cent released an album called ""Animal Ambition"" and made it available for purchase using Bitcoin. At the time, he reportedly made over $400,000 in Bitcoin sales. Who says rappers aren't tech-savvy? 
*  In 2017, a man in Florida was arrested for using Bitcoin to pay for a  hitman to murder his ex-girlfriend. The hitman turned out to be an  undercover FBI agent, and the man was sentenced to life in prison. Talk  about a cautionary tale! 
*  The first Bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver, Canada in 2013. It  allowed users to exchange Canadian dollars for Bitcoin and vice versa.  Today, there are over 25,000 Bitcoin ATMs around the world. It's like a  digital piggy bank! 

Despite the ups and downs, we're all part of an experiment, and who knows where it will take us? Whether you're in it for the long haul or just for the laughs, don't forget to HODL your beer and enjoy the show.

405,"The Traditional Banking System Is No Longer ""Safer"" Than Crypto After Recent Events",11sw29x,"So I'll admit, even though I've been in crypto for years and years and am a fan and advocate for crypto, in some ways it never felt as ""safe"" as traditional banking. With recent events  happening ie banks collapsing and bank runs that ""safety"" offered by the traditional banking system is no longer there.

Here's what I mean by this, even though I've made hundreds of crypto transactions or sends, every time I send crypto I'm kind of on the edge of my seat waiting for it to arrive and always a little unsure if it will. Ultimately were still living in a world where eventually you need an offramp for crypto to fiat and you always wonder if Coinbase or Binance or whomever else is going to screw you. Everytime I access my hardware wallet i'm hoping it doesnt make me to a seed reset. 

I guess the point I'm trying to make is the traditional banking system has always instilled a bit more confidence or surety than crypto, but seeing as how we're very close to having bank runs, banks are collapsing, even the bank isn't a safe place to store money.

Now a bit more confidence has been instilled in banking since for now at least the government seems to be willing to backstop any bank to any amount regardless of 250k FDIC limits, however realize this only happenned because which bank failed. Gavin Newsom had 3 businesses there as well as his wifes charity, Oprah had money there, tech companies who are buddies and big donors to politicians had money there. If this had been a small community bank realize it would not have been saved and they would have let people lose money.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is Crypto in a hardware wallet is as good as it gets, yeah this is something that's probably always been true but these recent events really highlight that fact",rulesforrebels,72,21,0.71

408,Gensler suggests proof-of-stake tokens are securities,11svltm,"SEC Chairman Gary Gensler [Said He Believes Cryptocurrencies Utilizing Proof-Of-Stake Are Securities](https://www.theblock.co/post/220297/gensler-suggests-proof-of-stake-tokens-are-securities) - On Friday, The New York Attorney General (NYAG) Described ETH As A Security In A Lawsuit Again Crypto Exchange KuCoin.

Gensler was asked by reporters to comment on CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam’s remarks that ETH is a commodity during Congressional testimony last week. Gensler responded: ‘The investing public is investing anticipating a return, anticipating something on these tokens, whether they're proof-of-stake tokens, where they're also looking to get returns on those proof-of-stake tokens and getting 2%, 4%, 18% returns…

Whatever they're promoting and putting into a protocol, and locking up their tokens in a protocol, a protocol that's often a small group of entrepreneurs and developers are developing, I would just suggest that each of these token operators ... seek to come into compliance, and the same with the intermediaries.’ 

In 2021 Gensler suggested that staking via third party services could constitute a securities offering. In an interview last month, Gensler said believes ‘bitcoin’ to be fundamentally different from other crypto projects due to its ‘unique history and creation story.’  

Gensler also said all crypto outside of spot ‘bitcoin’ transactions and purchases of goods and services with crypto should fall under the agency’s purview.Last month, the SEC settled charges with Kraken related to the exchange’s staking services. The SEC alleged the service represents a security offering. 

Last week, the NYAG charged crypto exchange KuCoin over ‘for failing to register as a securities and commodities broker-dealer and falsely representing itself as an exchange.’ The charges asserted that ETH, along with LUNA and UST are securities. The charges describe ETH as ‘the native cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain created by Vitalik Buterin and several others.’ According to the NYAG, ‘ETH’s development and management is largely driven by a small number of developers who hold positions in ETH and stand to profit from the growth of the network and the related appreciation of ETH.’ The NYAG also describes ETH’s 2014 ICO, which raised USD ~18M. 

The NYAG contends that ‘ETH’s development and management is largely driven by a small number of developers who hold positions in ETH and stand to profit from the growth of the network and the related appreciation of ETH.’ In 2014, some of these developers founded the Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss non-profit, before the ICO was held. The NYAG points out that the ICO was ‘governed by documents the ETH Genesis Sale Terms and Conditions and the Proposed Use of Revenue.’ Court documents also describe Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), and claim that ‘Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation retain significant influence over Ethereum and are often a driving force behind major initiatives’ which are material to the asset’s price. Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation are said to have played ‘key roles’ in the shift to PoS. 

In regards to staking itself, court documents compare (PoS) to proof-of-work and notes that under the latter system, ‘ETH no longer relies upon competition between computers but instead now relies on a pooling method that incentivizes users to own and stake ETH.’ 

My takeaway is that the NYAG charges, along with Gensler’s comments, implicate a broad range of blockchain-related activity. Having said that, regulators do not seem to have reached a consensus, considering the differing views between the SEC and CFTC. Some clarity may emerge through litigation or legislation, however, these processes are typically drawn out. 

In this context, Ethereum and other PoS networks and tokens will be exposed to increased regulatory complexity, which implicates a wide-range of activity, for an unclear duration",xof711,46,1,0.52

A human who does not feel pain would not survive because we need negative feedback in order to successfully navigate our physical environment.  Similarly, an ""investor"" who has only been operating in the post-gfc world only knows the ""stonks (or crypto) only goes up"" narrative.  There's no serious pain/risk, just buy indexes or big caps and hodl.

Without this negative feedback our view of underlying reality becomes innacurate, and wildly so.  Speculation is seen as investing.  Do any eth ""investors"" have any idea how much revenue is generated within the ethereum ecosystem, or what the costs are?  Does anyone know the names, professional backgrounds, and reputations of key players within this ecosystem other than Buterin?  I don't.  This is standard procedure for any minimally responsible investor and without it what you're doing is speculation.

411,Will crypto games ever stop getting considered as investments and just be played for fun?,11sub4i,"One thing I keep noticing with crypto games, barely anyone ever mentions if they are actually fun to play! Most reviewers on YouTube for example, are quick to tell you how much you can be making while playing this game and how good of an investment it can turn out to be.

But why doe games have to be considered an investment? In my opinion, the primary purpose of playing games is to have fun and enjoy the experience, not to stress out about how much money you can make on it. When you start viewing games as investments, it can take away from the enjoyment of playing the game. Instead of focusing on the game itself, you become too focused on maximizing profits, and with maximizing profits comes cheating and boting. Axie infinite for example, had tons of cheaters and bots accounts battling over and over again, some crypto games even allowed bots. 

While yes, it is possible to make money through crypto games, I think it should be viewed as a bonus rather than the main goal. Keep the focus on the enjoyment of the game itself, and enjoy the benefits that comes with it. Don't encourage lazy developers to use crypto as an excuse to create bad games!",Tenzu9,85,14,0.7

Everyone remembers their first investment and how they felt like the king/queens of the world! Nothing is stopping you now, but your own greed and selfishness and the ""Why not?"" mentality. And even when you have learned your lesson, you start having those daunting thoughts that drive you to try and make up your losses ASAP. On a personal note, I have went through these phases in a span of 3 years, and in those 3 years I have lost money (Thank you EOS you piece of shit, or am I the piece of ignorant shit for blindly following a coin with little research?), ultimately to better investors who had better positions in the market and with toughened hands from bad experiences. I believe that in the 4th to 5th year is were you can make a profit as an average self learning investor (In crypto and stock, as a spot trader, not leverage trader, plz do stay away from that).

I repeatedly stressed that they need to keep the seed phrases safe and keep duplicate copies.  
One of my friends wrote it down on a piece of paper, I made him at least write it down on two papers, and then he placed them in a notes book.  
I told him he should also take time to re-write them so if someone finds the paper, they can't just access his account, I walked him through different methods of obfuscating the info, so he could only read it. I told him to keep the paper in two separate geographic locations in case there is a fire or some disaster.

If anyone other than banks would have so low amount of real cash compared to amount on paper they would spend life in prison for making a ponzi. We laugh at tether, rightfully so, but tether still is backed by more actual real money compared to average bank. Banks get your money and then they legally can lend someone else 3 or 5 times more, in some situations even 10 times more than they actually have. We call it fractional reserve system. Idea is supposed to be good in theory, it is supposed help economy, but  110 years of it's fractional reserve's existence and it only fuck up everything over and over again ( 1929 and 2008 were a thing in big part, cause banks keept borrowing money every random person with no control and without back up for withdrawals in hard cash... Banks in modern version are a pure scam.

It is big problem for people, since most  money banks use never were even printed, they exist just as numbers online, it is a thing unfortunately. Unless banks will have at least 50% or 60% money they use  nothing will change. Few banks go bankrupt now, few more will bankrupt every few years, cause whole system is the problem. At least in crypto no one can print more coins, blockchain doesn't lie, if crypto is in your wallet no bank or exchange can do anything  it. Perfect solution would be bank system 100% backed with cash or even better by gold. With right customers to privacy and no fisting or controlling  you transastion. Sounds good? Yes. It is possible? No, cause greedy banks and governments don't want change for better. They created the system and protest it. Only solution to solve banking problem is crypto keept in wallets 

If you keep all your money on exchanges whole  time, you basically help them turn into banks, they use more crypto that they can, cause all crypto is keept in their wallets, and you crypto transactions on exchange  are offchain. Basically they use excel to track how much money in crypto you have. You have no idea if they actually have 100% of coins they should have. In many cases exchanges borrow or gamble with customers money and it end terribly. If you withdraw from exchange to wallet, and only then you can be sure your exchange doesn't try to become  another bank.

Crypto kept in wallet mean you have full control, no one print more money out of your crypto holdings, no one tell you what you can do with or control how you spend your money. You want to send $1 mln by bank they will keep those money for days, ask for papers, and even then can say sorry, you want to buy crypto for ""your own good"" we won't allow it. In crypto you want send fricking $1mln or even $100mln? 3 minutes and done. No questions, no control, no one ""leverage"" your money to borrow them like banks would do.

1. Practical application: XRP has been shown to have a direct and real utility beyond speculative trading by enabling cryptocurrency payments in retail settings thanks to the partnership. It functions as a means of exchange, allowing customers to purchase XRP like they would traditional currencies.

2. Decentralization and independence from Ripple: The fact that XRP is being utilized in a payment system developed by third-party companies (Xumm and Frii) demonstrates that XRP's utility is not solely dependent on Ripple. This independence supports the argument that XRP should not be considered a security tied to Ripple.

3. Cross-currency transactions: The Xumm and Frii collaboration enables businesses to accept any cryptocurrency in return for their preferred currency, demonstrating XRP's capacity to facilitate smooth cross-currency transactions.

4. XRP ecosystem expansion: The collaboration puts XRP into mainstream business, broadening its reach beyond the cryptocurrency community. The Xumm and Frii collaboration contributes to the growth and maturation of the XRP ecosystem by providing a viable option for merchants and customers.

5. Improved loyalty programs and digital coupons: In addition to payments, the relationship provides other benefits, such as loyalty programs and digital coupons, showcasing the versatility and utility of XRP within the business ecosystem.

TL:DR

The Xumm and Frii partnership successfully showcases XRP's utility by implementing a working solution for retail payments, allowing customers to make cryptocurrency transactions in everyday scenarios. This real-world application effectively counters the SEC's claim that XRP lacks utility, demonstrating its practical use beyond mere speculation.",666ahmed666,12,31,0.86
424,Seed Phrase vs Public Address,11sqw4r,"I thought this might be helpful to newbies or those who only operate on exchanges. Some wallet basics, with etherium as the example. 

Seed Phrase:
A seed phrase, also known as a recovery phrase, is a set of words that is used to create and restore an Ethereum wallet. When a user creates a new Ethereum wallet, they are provided with a seed phrase that is unique to their wallet. The seed phrase is a randomly generated string of 12-24 words that is used to create the private key for the wallet. The private key is then used to sign transactions and interact with the Ethereum network.

The seed phrase is an important security feature because it allows users to restore their wallet in case they lose access to their private key or if their device is lost or stolen. By entering the seed phrase into a compatible wallet, users can regain access to their wallet and all of its funds. It's important to keep the seed phrase secure and private, as anyone who has access to the seed phrase can also access the wallet and its funds.

Public Address:
A public address, also known as an Ethereum address, is a unique identifier that is used to send and receive Ethereum tokens. Each Ethereum wallet has a public address, which is a string of letters and numbers that starts with ""0x"". The public address is derived from the wallet's private key, but it can be shared with others without compromising the security of the wallet.

When a user wants to receive Ethereum tokens, they can share their public address with the sender. The sender can then use the public address to send the tokens to the recipient's wallet. However, in order to access and use the tokens, the recipient must have access to the private key associated with the wallet's public address.

Tl:dr - don’t share seed phrase, do share public address.",SpiceWeaselBAM,40,5,0.62

426,My Frustration with SEC's Failure to Adequately Regulate Crypto,11sqr9f,"As someone who has been actively involved in the cryptocurrency space for quite some time now, I feel compelled to share my growing frustration with the SEC inability to effectively regulate this market.

The lack of clear and consistent guidelines from the SEC has led to several issues:

&#x200B;

1. Unclear Classification: The SEC's failure to provide definitive guidelines for classifying cryptocurrencies as securities, commodities or currencies has left many of us in a state of confusion and uncertainty making it difficult to navigate the market and plan for the future.  
 
2. Inadequate Enforcement: I've seen many bad actors go unchecked while the SEC's 	enforcement efforts have focused primarily on high-profile cases. This selective approach creates a culture of fear that stifles innovation and discourages newcomers from entering the space.
3. Overreach: The SEC's aggressive approach towards some projects, such as the lawsuit against Ripple, has been disheartening to witness. It feels like they're hindering the growth and adoption of legitimate cryptocurrencies that have the potential to revolutionize industries.  
 

I believe the SEC should consider the following steps to address these problems:

&#x200B;

1. Educate: The SEC must invest in understanding the complexities of the crypto market and its technology in order to make informed decisions and provide the clarity we desperately need.  
 
2. Collaborate: The SEC should cooperate with other regulatory bodies, industry experts and the crypto community to create a comprehensive regulatory framework that promotes transparency and fairness for all market participants.  
 
3. Adapt: The SEC needs to be more adaptable to the ever-changing crypto landscape which includes being open to new ideas, technologies and market dynamics that foster innovation and growth.  
 

We must come together to advocate for fair and effective regulation. We must engage with the SEC and other regulatory bodies, share our personal experiences and concerns and contribute to the development of a competent regulatory framework.",Drogon__,14,5,0.65
427,The reason why the media related to crypto space is full of scams.,11sqnf9,"Greetings from Portugal!

Online advertising is big business, with companies like Google generating billions in revenue by selling our attention to advertisers. Advertisers pay to show their ads to us, and the more attention they get, the more they pay. 

Places like Youtube will be running an algorithm similar to the ad space auction house. Aside from online advertising, platforms have enabled scams big time. And it's not because these companies want to advertise that stuff. It's because these companies are the best and only option that these advertisers have. 

This is a totally new species of power and influence. Add space on television is very expensive because there can only be one thing playing on a channel at anytime. 

This means that it's not in the budget of the smaller operators pitching some new day trading seminar, because the television channel can only have one thing playing at a time. 

Its audience is also broader than something like a specific interest YouTube channel or website for big companies with a broader. Real products like the iPhone? That doesn't matter, but if a weird mobile game was to buy airtime on a TV channel, they have no way of making sure that the people watching the ad would be interested in mobile gaming. The ads are also much less likely to get approved for commercial or radio television because it is possible for a studio team to individually review each and every ad that will get played on their station during a time slot.

I would love to hear the community's thoughts on this!

428,Bitcoin Increasingly Feels Like a Credit Default Swap (CDS) Against a Collapse of the Banking System,11spt2g,"After the failures of Silvergate, SVB and Signature, the next bank is in trouble. The cost of insuring the bonds of Credit Suisse Group (155th largest bank in the World) against default just climbed to the highest on record sparking concerns about broader contagion in the banking industry.

5-year credit default swaps (CDS) for  Credit Suisse jumped as much as 36 basis points two days ago to more than 460 basis points. Meanwhile it has become more expensive to protect against Credit Suisse‘s bankruptcy than the losses expected. The last time CDS were intensively discussed was in 2007/2008 after the collapses of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and their preceding CDS record surges (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lehman-cds-rbc-idUSN1040517120080910).

Increasingly it becomes clear, our bank money is not that safe after all and Bitcoin may not only function as a decentralized digital currency that operates independently of any central authority, but could also be seen as a hedge against the failure of today‘s banking industry. Therefore, Bitcoin proponents and crypto enthusiasts argue that Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies can be viewed as a type of credit default swap for the banking system (e.g. https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/why-bitcoin-is-a-cds-on-the-fed)

1. What is a CDS? It essentially is a financial contract that provides insurance against the default of a particular debtor, typically a company or government. Similarly, Bitcoin can be seen as providing a type of insurance against the failure of the traditional banking system. Because Bitcoin operates independently of (central) banks and is not subject to the same risks as traditional financial institutions, it can be seen as a hedge against potential banking failures. The recent rally in the last days can likely be attributed to investors seeking shelter of an inherent crash of the old financial system.

2. Bitcoin is designed to be resistant to inflation, which is another key risk that traditional currencies and banking systems are subject to. Because the supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 Mio. by its algorithmic design, it is immune to the inflationary pressures that can devalue traditional currencies and erode the purchasing power of savers. Meanwhile inflation is still persistent in the US (and elsewhere) and is still at 6% p.a. (peak of 9.1% in 2022).

3. Bitcoin is often seen as a safe haven asset, particularly during times of economic and political uncertainty. When traditional financial markets experience turbulence, investors often flock to alternative assets such as gold and Bitcoin, seeking a safe haven from market volatility. This flight to safety can help to stabilize the value of Bitcoin, making it an attractive option for investors looking to protect their assets. While Bitcoin has held quite steady at around $20k over the last months especially after all the economic turmoil and collapses of crypto con artists like FTX, it didn’t provide the safe harbor in early 2020 as many hoped for (felling from $10k to $4k in a matter of days). It will be interesting to watch how the volatility will play out in today’s scenario of a financial collapse. Nevertheless, in countries like Venezuela, Nigeria, Turkey or Zimbawe Bitcoin already serves as safe harbor or shelter against dystopic CBDCs (https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/24/why-nigerians-arent-turning-to-the-enaira-despite-crippling-cash-shortages).

In conclusion, Bitcoin can be seen as an instrument similar to a credit default swap against the banking system. By providing a decentralized, inflation-resistant, and safe-haven alternative to traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin offers a unique form of insurance against the risks and uncertainties of the banking system.

TL:DR: Buy Bitcoin and other blue chip cryptocurrencies as a hedge against a failure of the banking system.",Antana18,29,2,0.57

Many coins think they solve and issue, and sound just offical enough to convince someone to buy the coin. With a flashy YouTube video, a fresh website. 

And lots of buzzwords, it’s easy for companies to trick the public into thinking a coin is useful, example: Solana.

It reminds me of shark tank, a tv show about investors, and average joes with a company, new or not even started yet pitch their product. 

And the sad reality is most of these people aren’t even solving an issue, and this is like most coins. 


Now the question is, which coins are good. And actually solve an issue, I’m not the most knowledgeable, but I know 4. 

BTC, ETH, Atom, and usdt (yes usdt). 


#BTC

Bitcoin is the gold of crypto, it’s the dominant coin, so dominant. That there are subreddits and communities so involved in BTC, and only BTC. And believe all other crypto coins are useless.


#ETH

Ethereum is widely considered as the second coin to not be an alt coin. It’s the brother of BTC, but is completely different. 

Ethereum is always evolving and improving, and of it keeps it up. It will be an unstoppable force in 50+ years! 


#USDT

Yes, I’ve prepared to get downvoted to the floor for this one, but don’t like banks? Don’t like gold? Don’t trust the government? Well if you believe a crash will come, you can swap all your coins for usdt, and constantly trade that way. 

I can trade a trading pair of BTC, and usdt. One stays the same price, and one is always changing. This makes trading so much better, such lower fees. And way easier! 

#ATOM

Now atom might be a little biased since it’s my biggest bag, but this coin recently implemented a feature called , “Replicated security.”

Long story short, a new coin is vulnerable to cyber attacks, they use the security and protection atom offers, and in exchange the new coin gives some of the coin to the stakers and validators of atom. 

It basically makes the whole crypto space for new coins more safe. And maybe the future 5th coin wouldn’t have been able to reach a high mc if it didn’t use atom’s replicated security. And prevent cyber attacks.

439,What would happen if ETH is classified as a security?,11smiby,"There are dark clouds gathering over Ethereum. A few days ago, New York State Attorney General Leticia James filed a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin. The agency argues that ETH and some other cryptocurrencies are securities and should be registered.

Why should you be concerned? This is the first time the US Attorney General's office has made such claims (i.e., classifying ETH as a security).

Fortunately, there is no consensus on this matter in the White House so far. Different regulators are publicly debating whether ether is a commodity or a security. For example, CFTC chairman Rostin Behnam expressed a different opinion. He believes stablecoins and Ethereum should be regulated as commodities.

How will the arguments of the New York prosecutor be received in Washington? And how would the status of many cryptocurrencies change if ETH were classified as a security?

Why did the United States target Ethereum?

Since Ethereum switched to the proof-of-stake algorithm, there has been a heated debate in the US over the classification of this asset. After all, investors can now stake their coins in exchange for profits. This mechanism is not much different from earning interest on bonds - i.e., securities.

The new indictment filed by the New York prosecutor's office may bring the legal debate back to the forefront.

If ETH gains security status, it will have a strong impact on the cryptocurrency market. After all, ether will start trading on different terms (if it will be subject to free circulation in the US at all).

New York's Arguments

The specter of repression has long hung over the Ethereum coin. The fact is that the first supporters and investors received their tokens in 2015 as part of the ICO. The prosecutor's office also mentions this in its lawsuit against KuCoin. Letitia James believes that ether is a security because:

* First, it had an early distribution plan as part of the ICO.
* Second, the blockchain infrastructure is supported by a relatively small group of participants.

It is worth recalling the Howey test, which SEC uses to determine whether a particular asset is a security. One of the indicators is precisely when a project is maintained by a specific group of people. And when their work affects the return on the given asset.

The Howey test states that a security is ""an agreement, transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and expects profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.""

In the lawsuit, prosecutors focus on the role of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation. Lawyers believe that these individuals have ""significant influence over Ethereum and often initiate major changes in the Ethereum blockchain that affect the functionality and value of ETH.""

The document also refers to potential profits for Buterin and developers who control the Ethereum blockchain. ""They will benefit from the development of the network and the associated growth in the price of ETH,"" the agency writes.

The prosecutor's office believes that Buterin and developers presented their project ""as an investment that depends on the growth of the Ethereum network.""

The document emphasizes that Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation received a large amount of ETH in the ICO round and they still hold a lion's share of the coins.

Implications of recognizing ETH as a security

The NYAG lawsuit will undoubtedly initiate new proceedings and attract regulatory attention. However, the decision is definitely not final.

California lawyer and Brookwood PC partner Collins Belton explains the situation:

>“The SEC is working more in tandem with New York than with other states. At least that's the information we have right now. It is too early to say that the lawsuit is a 100% precursor to recognizing ether as a security in the USA. However, I think it is a very strong call. It is precisely the kind of argument that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler will be making in future rhetoric.”

By the way, Gensler has been more active in pushing the industry lately. He previously suggested that Ethereum's move to proof-of-stake brings the coins closer to assets that are under the SEC's jurisdiction (and the agency, let us remind you, deals with securities).

The official often refers to the Howey test in his interviews. He believes that the Proof-of-stake algorithm makes ether a “security” because investors expect profits when they engage in staking. In addition, interest payments require the effort of validators and other network participants.

Impact on exchanges and DEXs

What will exchanges do if Ethereum is officially recognized as a security? Platforms wanting to list ETH would need to obtain a license to broker securities from the SEC. Here again, Belton's comment comes to mind:

>“If you are already registered in New York, there is a dilemma – either you have to remove ether from listings, or block customers in New York from buying ETH, or register as a broker-dealer.”

An interesting conflict arises. Exchanges that officially operate in New York now offer ether legally. They have been approved by the state financial regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

>“New York has been aware of the existence of local companies offering ether for years. After all, to be licensed and registered in the state, companies must work with assets from the green list by the NYDFS financial regulator. So it's crazy to hear the attorney general say, 'Hey guys, you're trading illegal securities, even though our financial regulator has allowed you to work with them.”

Not only centralized exchanges will have problems. DEXs may also face legal challenges if ether is recognized as a security.

>“It doesn't matter what platform you offer people to engage in such transactions. New York state law requires only official broker-dealers to deal in securities.”

There are already legal precedents in the US where authorities have successfully banned smart contract protocols. Just remember the Tornado Cash project.

Implications for other coins

The changing status of Ether will have global implications for cryptocurrencies in general.

According to the logic of the New York prosecutor, any tokens based on proof-of-stake could be classified as securities. Therefore, the law may potentially go far beyond ETH and affect a significant part of the ecosystem.

Bitcoin remains one of the few blockchains with a proof-of-work mechanism. Most large networks use PoS, like the Ethereum system. This means that regulators may also consider them securities.

440,"Reddit Avarar holders are being targeted with testnet scam, watch out!",11sm52e,"OK, some people here may dislike that Reddit even launched their Avatars - I get it, I really do! I've bought some because they are fun, I like the artwork, and I like using parts of then to dress up my avatar, not because I see them as some big investment opportunity.

The launch of Reddit Avatars have exposed a whole bunch of new people to crypto, some of these are actually worth reasonable money! 

**However - as is the usual pattern, where there's money to be made, there's scammers.**

So let me tell you how this scam works so hopefully you can avoid it, because I keep on seeing people getting stung by scam trades, and no doubt plenty more that keep silent.

It goes like this:

- Scammer PM's you, offering to buy your Avatar. They target people that don't understand blockchain tech specifically.

- They will likely offer you a-little above floor price on OpenSea, nothing too crazy, but a bit more - so looks like a nice easy sale (they will probably tell you the mint number has some special meaning to them, or something else that means they must have it, or that they don't do/understand OpenSea, or want to avoid fees blahblahblah).

- They will offer ETH, and because they trust you and are operating in good faith, they will send the ETH first.

- THIS IS WHERE IT GOES WRONG, they will send you testnet ETH on Goerli network, with some quite legit (but wrong) sounding explanation about it. They will use words you don't understand, they will say, 'Oh, it's like wrapped ETH on other networks like Polygon (WETH)'.

- They will be helpful, and guide you through how to see your deposited balance, show you the transaction to prove they paid etc, and might even explain how to switch to Goerli network in your wallet, how helpful!

- Buyer thinks 'OK, well ETH is ETH, so all is good, I got paid, I'll send them the Avatar they just purchased.'

So here's the thing to understand:

- Goerli is a test blockchain network.

- The ETH is issued free for developers to play around with and test things.

- The ETH you received is basically worthless, by its very nature its a test token (wrongly I think it is being traded, but last check it was worth a tiny, tiny fraction of 'real' ETH) - it will NOT mature in value; again its a freely distributed test token.

Regardless of what you think of Avatars, we all hate scammers; right?

443,I got Hacked and lost over 300K Today,11sksgs,"This is my first post and my most sad one to date. There of my wallets got hacked totaling over 300k.

I'm a ***complete moron*** for storing passwords and seed phrases for these accounts in Evernote here.

Metamask - 0x023D8a816A8b6394f3144fD74aA3820689fEcaA0

Rocketpool Node - 0xa24757BC32579541F33B1bCD2E36355D39B1686a \[withdrawl address was changed\]

I'm a big fan of MOONs and had over 80k. I can see the hacker swapped all my Metamask assets into ETH where they are currently stored at this address - 0xe147a73e7d783166f791f10342a0122db80814c4

I'm absolutely devastated and not sure what to do.

Should I contact the FBI?

It appears the hacker could be from Germany based on the Evernote access logs. I could be wrong and both logins could be from a VPN. **\[UPDATE - These login attempts came from a TOR Exit Node as mentioned in the comments. The below, however, was the first attempt to connect to my Evernote. It was not a successful login.\]**

My biggest loss is the Rocketpool Node. I may have the first compromised node? He changed the withdrawl address to - 0x8294b95d303949699167f7579c9da49f6359d4ff. I can do nothing while he collects rewards. I believe I have some time here since nothing can be physcially withdrawn until the Shanghai Upgrade.

Lastly the Deadalus account had maybe 8k in ADA where it currently hits in the Hackers address here - addr1q8lee9tt64w6uwj9xwne2hnca8x8e2vg87prhl43uqdhdgk232uaxahskg735wxx28xwrhjj97fhphnyz3ppn3fjpygsywcdlv

Thanks again and I deserve all the shame headed my way!

**UPDATE 1 -** Thanks for the love and support. I biggest concern is the Rocketpool Node which has about 250k staked. I can't change the the withdrawl address but looking at other options since the hacker can't withdraw until Shanghai upgrade

**Update 2 -** I believe the hacker may have slipped up. I have an IP address and mobile device that routes to an ISP in Singapore.

444,Coinbase Ethereum staking surpasses 6% apy,11skm6u,"Coinbase ethereum staking has surpassed 6% for the first time in years(usually hovering around 3-4%). Back in September, they estimated after the merge that they predicted seeing rates as high as 9%. I didn't think that was going to happen, but seeing their rates climbing over the last 6 months makes me think it's possible.

Currently, eth is at 6.08%apy, which is almost their highest staking option, only being beat out by cosmos, which is at 6.12%.

Coinbase also actually stakes their crypto to earn interest with protocols, unlike a lot of collapsed exchanges who were lending it out, which is how it all went belly up. This offers a more reissurance of not losing it all like the bankrupt exchanges(yet that chance is always not 0). 

This may come off as shilling, which it's not, so I'll also add coinbase. It does take a 25% cut of the staking rewards. The 6.08% rate shown is *after*, that cut, so they are actually making 8% off your ETH.

Coinbase also has a more live posted rate, and the rate for ETH flucates and changes usually daily up or down instead of just being a flat rate until they decide to randomly change it",BushyOreo,17,6,0.76
0,We must listen the arguments of those who are against cryptocurrency.,11wjepy,"Greetings from Portugal.

So our main goal is mass adoption in the future. That includes most people. So we must listen the ones aren't yet on board, because in order to achieve widespread adoption, we must understand and adress the concerns of those who have mixed feelings on cryptocurrencies.

The main arguments are the volatility of the price, the real need for crypto, how hard is it to learn and use and the scams around them. We have answers for all of those arguments. But instead of trying to convince then we must be empathetic and understand if they have or not patience to listen to our explanations.

Sometimes you just can't change their minds. And that's ok. Instead let's use those arguments to improve crypto projects and communities.

I'm sure I'm like a lot of others in that I have a lot of token dust from various farms.

These particles are normally less than a few dollars. For example, $0.43 in LYRA, etc.

2,Interesting divergence with the ALTs?,11wj4un,"Usually, as we all know, when Bitcoin pumps we see most of the ALTs pump at a higher percentage, this time we see Bitcoin out in front strong as and looking like it’s ready for the battle at $30k but the ALT market not really following? 

I see there to be a couple of reasons for this :

1) people are moving into crypto from more traditional savings and investments and are looking to invest in what is perceived as the most safest of cryptos : the bluechips I.e Bitcoin and Ethereum (though ETH hasn’t kept up with BTC rise oddly)

2) that the money flowing in has begun to take the view that ALT coins are actually, by and large, trash and that 99.9% of them are not gonna be around in 5 years.

It definitely looks to me like there is less appetite (currently) to buy coins that seem to be like the bluechips and more appetite to actually buy the quality Coins - BTC/ETH.

And if this is the case it would mean that the money flowing in is longer term money as opposed to speculative money that’s looking for a quick trade.",R0Y-BATTY,24,6,1.0

It was at about 32 cents and my swap comes out to 32.7 cents/moon 

If I had market bought moons on the mexc order book, it would’ve jumped the price up to about 37 cents

>if someone bought 145,000 moons via market order on mexc right now, we would see $1 moons 👀

Whereas liquidity from SushiSwap is much more automated from the liquidity pool that just balances the moon to eth holdings to have equal dollar value

>If someone market bought 145,000 moons via swap on sushiswap, the price would only move ~17% = ~39 cent moons

(Thanks to all of you liquidity providers, for your sacrifice.)

5,How do you respond to people who say that crypto has no value?,11wiulk,"This is a very common claim I hear from skeptics I meet, particularly those who listen to old-school finance icons like Charlie Munger.  At face value, it's expectedly hard to justify the usefulness of running millions of expensive space heaters just to have a currency when many others already exist.

The way I think about the value proposition of crypto (particularly of bitcoin) is by asking ""what is the cost of creating an institution that I trust enough to transfer billions of dollars of value through it regularly?"" For traditional institutions like banks it's something like a century of tenure, billions in capital requirements, and existing within a very complicated bureaucracy of checks and balances where I know I’ll only be fleeced in arduous, obfuscated ways. For currencies, it’s a competent military and a stable government, so a revolutionary war at least, plus centuries of slavery and colonialism if you want a really good one apparently. All very expensive and out of reach if you're an upstart nation. 

Bitcoin, on the other hand, derives it’s trustworthiness from the perfect reliability of math. This is what people are on about when they say Bitcoin eliminates “counter party risk”; your counter-party is an immutable algorithm. This is not to say that things can’t go arwy, it’s just much less likely than a human counter-party screwing you over, which they will definitely do the second the system fails to align incentives. This greatly decreases the cost of bootstrapping a nation or financial institution. You can afford passable beuracracy-driven counterparties in the first world so we aren’t forced to pay the upfront costs of integrating crypto such that it’s useful, but it would be way cheaper if we did.

As far as the electricity requirements of Bitcoin go, they tend to be renewables since those, when strategically placed, are the cheapest option. Otherwise, a lot of the electricity used is so-called ‘stranded energy’. A power plant needs to over-produce electricity to be able to reliably deal with demand-spikes and the otherwise wasted energy powers much of Bitcoin’s mining. I personally think that Elon Musk is actively trying to make crypto seem useless/frivolous with his strategic tweets and backing of doge because a big part of his battery development efforts at Tesla are for storing this stranded energy. He has already deployed mega batteries in Australia and every electron of stranded energy that ends up there is priced against the opportunity cost of using it to mine Bitcoin.

That's my spiel, I'm wondering how others think about this.",solarsalmon777,83,13,0.84
6,Schrödinger's BTC: It will and will not hit 1 million dollars,11wimxf,"I'm doing this post to show how Arthur Hayes's prediction of BTC to 1 million is both right and wrong. He is just very, very, VERY wrong on his time frame.

See [this graph](https://imgur.com/a/6JIe3bN) that shows the monthly chart of BTC on a logarythmic scale with each bull run increase represented by a green stick. As we clearly see, each % gain is smaller and smaller than before as BTC gets closer to it's ""value"". This means that in the next bull run BTC should hit approximately 100-130k. Crazy, right?

But if we look at the S&P500 1 year chart I posted [right here](https://imgur.com/a/LqFJbNx) we can clearly see that in the very long run the US dollar devaluates and wealth is created thus taking the price of stocks to unimaginable highs.

If we had asked someone in 1930 if the stock market was going to go from 5 dollars to 4800 he would say it was impossible. That there is no way that is happening and that there is not enough wealth in the earth for that.

12,Real liquidity and on/off ramps,11whwln,"The price of crypto is now irrelevant. 

Which is hard to accept when the market has been fixated on price for ~15 years. Without key fundamentals and real world application the crypto industry is now essentially just numbers on a screen.

This is the result of: 

1. Price ""manipulation"" via USD derivatives (stablecoins) 
2. Centralized Exchanges (CEX) oligarchy consolidation 
3. The external bank failures and regulatory pressure resulting in market loss of on/off ramps 

1) last year only ~11% of all crypto trades where in fiat. This was before the collapse of several businesses and CEX. The regulator push against BUSD and current banking crisis. I don't know what it is now but if anyone has a good source put it in the comments. 

Regardless the market is being ""protected"" by stablecoins. Namely USDT and  USDC. By volume they are the biggest cryptocurrencies 1st and 4th respectively with BUSD still 5th. 

The banking situation for USDC is now somewhat stabilized. But Circle the company behind USDC need to find new banking and clarify their position 

BUSD's Paxos and Binance are still under regulatory scrutiny 

USDT is a black hole that no one knows what is inside. 2 more weeks till that official audit 

However they are what is pushing the price of crypto up. Just go look at the volume 

2) They are able to do this because the companies behind them Tether, Paxos and Circle. Are ultimately just extensions of the CEXs Bitfinex, Binance and Coinbase. Whom themselves ( 2) are controlled by Ifinex ( parent company) Cumberland ( main liquidity provider) 

With Alameda gone, Cumberland is now the biggest and by all accounts only liquidity provider in crypto. Never heard of them.....That's why they on top, Google them 

Ifinex with the recent collapse of Silvergate now not only has the biggest stable coin ( USDT) but also bank. Deltec!  ( never heard of them, Google it) 

Note: Deltec is the bank for USDT which has the same directors as Ifinex 

These 2 companies, and to an extent Coinbase are now the crypto market. Together accounting for ~95% of all volume on CEX and DEX 

3) Because of global regulatory measures in the aftermath of FTX's collapse and the ongoing international banking crisis. Most on and off ramps for crypto are gone. Unless you got access to a big OTC desk you are now a HODLer 

This means that the price of crypto becomes irrelevant as you can't turn it back into fiat 

It's a money pit 

Small amounts of redemptions and outflows into fiat can be sustained. But even when the system was ~11% fiat; lack of liquidity resulted in the failure of several VC and lending platforms. 

The price can pump to $1 million similar to the Squid game token. But because you can't cash out it's just a number on a screen",GodlordHerus,7,3,0.8
13,"If you used Mexc you may be (possibly) able to claim Arbitrum tokens on your Mexc account too. I asked Mexc support about that, here is what they said.",11whkjv,"Since many of us traded or bought/ sold moons on Mexc our moon adresses on Mexc accounts are possibly able to claim Arbitrum tokens. Problem is on exchange we have no keys, so can't just connect wallet to claim it. Unless Mexc will help us with that those tokens will be lost.

There is site where you paste your adress and are able to check if you are eligible for Arbitrum Airdrop, for example my moon adress on Mexc could possibly claim 625 Arbitrum tokens, less than my  Reddit vault, but still it would be great amount, possibly few hundreds dollars. And I am not only one, many of other people including some of you  that used Moons on Mexc maybe be able to be eligible for additional Arbitrum tokens. But as I said unless Mexc will be able to help us those tokens will be lost, cause we have no keys to exchange accounts.

I asked Mexc support about that and after hard explaining (anyone who talk with  exchange support know what I mean) they have no announcement or event about airdrop yet. I even send them screenshot of Mexc  site themselves announcing  listing Arbitrum and about airdrop. Don't know what will be from this.  Maybe they will announce they will claim in our name and send us, maybe they will claim themselves ( also possible, but we would have read all Mexc TOS for that). Or maybe they will do nothing and all tokens will be lost. I am not even entirely sure they can claim it themselves or help us to do so, but if there is even  bit of hope, we shouldn't just wish they will do something, but instead ask what can we do.

Tagging them on Twitter or contacting support to make them more aware about this seems like a great idea. Ofc all with respect and dignity, don't  behave like some assholess.

14,"Be careful where you store even your crypto funds next. Remember, exchanges also use banks to store funds",11whdfi,"Those who are still celebrating a banking crash need to slow down a bit. Everyone will get hurt in a crash even crypto, though crypto will just be hurt less.

Remember that exchanges also use banks to store funds. This could be for things such as fiat-based self-insurance, employee pay, profits, short-term cash reserves, amenities and typical utilities etc. Exchanges also exist in the real world and run off fiat like most everything else does. But probably heir biggest achillies heel in all this is fiat withdrawals and deposits. All that fiat for these services must be stored somewhere, which has a 99% chance of being a bank. And it is highly unlikely these amounts accumulate to less than 250k in each account in the US, or whatever the insurance amount is in the appropriate jurisdiction. Even if it was, I doubt investors would enjoy having to wait for they payout from regulators with stuck funds in the meantime.

Pro tips:

* Stay away from fiat deposits and withdrawals. Even if solvent, who knows how long these would take. Try P2P instead, if you must.
* Stay away from fiat-quoted pairs/contracts. It may not have be particularly relevant prior but it certainly makes a difference now. For example, the pair BTC/USD is a fiat-quoted pair with USD as the quote currency. BTC/USDT is a fully crypto pair with Tether as the quote currency. This also applies to other fiat quote currencies like EUR, AUD and especially SEK(Swedisk Krona)
* If you can, probably avoid exchanges that use fiat-quoted pairs at all. Any exchange that lists fiat-quoted is at risk of losing funds. Ironically, this applies to many of the US exchanges which we typically view as safer, Although in the US the Fed,FDIC and reasury have done as much as they can short of a complete bailout but who knows how much it will help  really struggling banks.
* **I am not saying to go use these exchanges**. But ironically there are smaller exchanges that deal solely in crypto pairs. These are ironically at much less rick due to bank failures. Although as per usual, watch out for rugpulls, frozen funds, hacks etc.
* **Get an exit plan(s).** This might be the most important thing here. No matter what, you should have always planned and prepared an escape route in case things go south ,.

17,Thoughts on Crypto Taxes,11wg7jo,"I want to know people's thoughts on crypto taxes. I know that no one *loves* to pay taxes, but I think this topic is going to be of growing importance and could possibly make or break crypto as a whole. Some of course may think cryptos shouldn't be taxed at all, but I think it is somewhat of an inevitability.

I myself am still a crypto beginner and am *definitely* no expert in financial law, so I can't really make any strong judgements or predictions about this. So I want to know what others that may know more than me think about this topic. 

As of now, crypto taxes of course vary mostly depending on the jurisdiction. In some countries, like the US, cryptos are treated as property and subject to capital gains tax. In other countries, like Singapore, cryptos are not taxed unless they are used for business purposes.

What I think is that financial law itself is going to have to evolve beyond what it is now. I think idealistically, we should have laws pertaining to each crypto individually (maybe this will be easier when the market isn't so saturated with shitcoins) and each should vary depending on how that crypto operates and what it's purpose is. I think there will need to be whole committees established to create these laws. I know that's a pretty sizable undertaking but I (as I think many of us) believe crypto is the future and therefore something like this needs to happen. 

So what are people's thoughts on the future of crypto taxes? I would love to hear from varying perspectives about this topic.",grundlesquatch,121,13,0.7
18,I just guessed a seed phrase to a random wallet but it’s even more improbable thank you think.,11wfe5a,"About 10 days ago, someone made a post and very confidently undressed their 24 word long seed phrase for all of us to see. However it was spread all over the place you see. Randomized. The owner of said seed put a $1000 worth of ETH in it, and challenged anyone to rearrange it into the correct order. Already extremely improbable to achieve, and that’s an understatement. I saw this post only a few hours ago but I knew immediately then that this was my white whale.  
And I, Ishmael. 

So I did it about 4-5 times while I was pooping, just shuffling and then pasting into a wallet import.  
When all of a sudden,  
my screen changed.  
I barely processed it, but I realized that I was indeed staring at a wallet.  

The only thing that went through my brain. 
No. 
The only thing that could go through my brain at that moment, was Kevin Flynn from Tron Legacy saying “I got in” and then badass spacey overture playing

And if you don’t understand, I’ll just tell you open and honestly from the bottom of my heart.  
You will never hear me speak truer than this moment so hear me now because ill only tell you once. 

You need to listen to the Tron Legacy soundtrack. 
It’s very good, I promise you. 
It seems weird I know, but it’s great. 

Anyways I got in. 
Or at least I thought I did. 
I certainly hoped I did. 
But as I scanned, I realized something was completely off. 
There was no money absolutely anywhere. 

It was a completely different wallet.  
Same string of words. Just rearranged.  

I was stunned, I thought there must be something I don’t know to make this more likely than it seems, but I couldn’t tell for sure.  
I went to check the comments on a whim, and there I saw someone theorize this exact scenario taking place.  
which only led to further discussion between others about just how unfathomably improbable that would be.
I mean I don’t think I can even grasp the odds truly, I honestly don’t know.  

My best guess would be somewhere between, it was always going to happen because of the inescapable horror that is entropy, or spontaneously combust and then have Yahweh descend from the heavens and give me a handy.

Here’s proof:

19,Do you think memecoins will play a role in the next bullrun?,11wfa5c,"I do not.  While they have seen some crazy growth in the past few bull runs, our next run will be different.  Here are a few reasons why I think that we will finally rid ourselves of memecoins from the top 25 or so:

* Ever told the same joke twice? 3 times? 10 times?  It's a lot less funny each time. People will be less inclined to throw money into garbage for the fun of it.
* This is the first ""recession"" since BTC's inception.  With inflation rates still high and banks closing, people will be buying to protect the value of their money instead of as a pure investment.
* Recessions bring a much more serious tone to the market.  People will have less money that they can afford to lose, and will be less inclined to take big risks on alts in general.
* Doge specifically inflates by 5 billion coins a year.  Reaching previous ATH's will require a LOT more money pouring into it.
* Eventually we will see much more institutional money in this market, looking for the safest options to store their value and make trades.

I've been quietly following the crypto space for a few years now, however I often find myself hesitant to discuss the topic in real-life conversations.

Maybe it's the fear of being judged or dismissed as a ""crypto fanatic,"" or perhaps it's the worry of being perceived as too financially ambitious or even reckless. Whatever the reason may be, I find that discussing cryptocurrency can often lead to uncomfortable or even confrontational conversations with friends and family who don't share the same level of interest.

I'm curious to hear if anyone else feels the same way. Have you ever experienced a negative reaction when bringing up cryptocurrency in real-life conversations? Or do you find that it's generally well-received and accepted? And how do you navigate these conversations?

&#x200B;

Things are absolutely crazy around here! In just a weekend, we saw a merge taking place that normally would take about an year to be completed. I'm talking, of course, about UBS acquiring Credit Suisse for **$3.2bn**. To give you an ideia of this amount, Credit Suisse was worth **8$bn** dollars during  last trading session (03/17/23), wich is about **60% discount.** In other words, Credit Suisse stock closed at 1,96$ friday, but investors will receive only 0,82$ per share. Well, but at least they get something, you might be telling yourselfes. Yes, sure, but not in cash. In fact, investors will receive one share of UBS for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares they hold. Plus, in order to UBS to accept this deal, Swiss government will absorb **$9bn** in losses! So imagine the amount of dog shit wrapped in cat shit the government and UBS saw in Credit Suisse portfolio! Plus, shareholders didn't have any word to say in this deal, wich is absolutely crazy here, where a lot of matters goes to public referendums, and democracy is higly regarded!

We also saw yesterday [central banks getting together in order to improve their liquidity](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/international/federal-reserve-other-central-banks-move-boost-global-dollar-liquidity), wich means, making easier to transfer funds between banks to avoid certain ones to become ""dry"". In other words, money printing is going ""brrrr"" again, and the FED's effort of hitting the breaks when the truck of inflation was going down the hill like crazy might have just ruined the breaks!

So, I don't think this moment of mistrust about the banking system will disappear like that. And that maybe the reason why btc is soaring, and news about crazy bets regarding bitcoin price are going viral. Everybody said bitcoin would need to be tested during a crisis moment. Well, i'll be damned if this isn't a moment of crisis!

24,BTC Dominance Adjusted For Stables,11wdvh8,"With BTC dominance rapidly rising, I wanted to take a brief look at the dominance charts with stables removed. 

Stablecoins account for 134 billion of the current market cap. That puts us at approx 1.05T market cap with them  excluded.

If we now adjust the dominance % that results in (approximately):

1. BTC: 52.4%
2. ETH: 21%
3. Alts: 26.6%

The question then is…where to from here? Are we expecting BTC dominance to rise and if so, at what % should we consider alts a buy?

This statement is utterly false and shows the lack of understanding of basic notions of trading and value.

The Market Cap of a coin is not correlated to the amount of money poured into a coin. Right now, if we all put sell orders at 1 Million and people are still willing to buy then the price of Bitcoin would be 1 Million for a market cap of around 20 Trillion.

It doesn't mean that the 20 Trillion Market cap is liquid nor that this correlate to an influx of money of 20 Trillion.

This is also why people who are proposing wealth taxes to be put in place are proposing a very low percentage of the accumulated wealth => If you sell, maybe the market can't absorb the sell order and you could crush the value of the wealth you are being taxed on.

27,$1 mln in 90 days is impossible. Anyone who says otherwise is out of touch with reality and never heard about marketcap. Here is some math.,11wcy9y,"Saying Bitcoin can achieve $1mln price in 90 days is pure hopium, stupidity or even worse just a manipulation. It is impossible, and by impossible I mean not just hard to do, straight impossible if you have even slightest knowledge about general economy and crypto market caps.

Here is some math: Now BTC marketcap is bit over 540 bln  with current price $27.9k, so  to achieve $1mln we would have  to do x35.84 in less than 90 days. Is doing almost x36 in 90 days in crypto possible? Sure with small caps  even x1000 is possible, but they go from few thousands to millions dollars marketcap, not from billions to trillions. You remember million vs billion seconds quote? Millions seconds ago  was 12 days ago, billion second ago was 1992 (31 years ago). Let me add that trillion seconds ago  31,700 years ago. So trillion is unimaginable amount of time or in our case money. 20 trillion is x20 times more than that...

If BTC would do x38.84 it's marketcap would be 19.35 trillion dollars. That  woud mean  necessity to find somewhere 19.35 trillion dollars...  According to the Bank of the International Settlements from year 2021 whole cash on earth is equal to just 8.28 trillion dollars... So you want to invest  all cash on earth and non existing  11 additional trillions into BTC. Congrats you outdone even the Fed, they just wanted to print 2 trillions, you want to print 11 trillions. Ofc having market cap bigger than amount of cash is possible, for example whole stock marketcap  on earth is worth 83 trillions, but most of those money aren't real, just valuation based on companies and things they produce and hold. Typical company stock share is based on P/E (price to earning ratio), which basically mean stock shares price is multipled in comparation to yearly profit. Usually average P/A is 15 to 25. Which historically mean stock companies value is based on x15 to x25  of current yearly profit. Current P/A on avarage in stock market in  march 2023 is x23.2, so it mean those 83 trillion are based on next 23 years, not just now and here... With $1mln BTC you won't have P/A ratio, cause Bitcoin is not stock company, it's value is here and now, so $19 trillion BTC would in reality be much  more than 83 trillion in stocks.

Additionaly Bitcoin doesn't move alone, whole market follow him. $19 trillion pumped in to just BTC is impossible. Do you really imagine BTC pumping to $1mln while ETH stay at just $1.76k? What about other coins? According to CoinMarketCap  current marketcap of whole crypto is 1.17 trillion dollars. 1.17 trillion divided by BTC's marketcap mean x2.16. So Crypto market cap is x2.16 times bigger than BTC marketcap, which mean to pump BTC to $1mln we would need not just $19 trillion but over $40 trillion. Even if we would magically assume BTC dominance would grow more, it still would still be at least 5 to 10 trillion additional dollars.

Is $1 mln BTC totally impossible then? No of course not, inflation and printing devaluate money, $1 mln BTC in 10 to 20 years from today is not impossible by any means. But in just 90 days? No way. It never happened before and nothing suggest it will happen now except one guy making a silly bet and some people in crypto space repeating that cause they have no idea what marketcap is. Unless in next 90 days whole world including all 8 billion people and all 193 world governments adopt BTC nothing even close to $1 mln will be possible.

28,"[SERIOUS] MOON MC growth potential by still being unknown to many people in general [MONS, ANALYSIS, DISCUSSION]",11wccid,"Many of this subreddit's users (me included) believe that MOON as a CryptoCurrency (ERC-20 token on Arbitrum Nova blockchain) has a lot of potential for growth in its Market Cap (MC = price \* number of coins). 

I will address this potential from the aspect / narrative of MOONs being something unknown or nearly unknown to the general cryptoverse masses and thus when more of them get to see it, hear about it, more will want to either invest in it, use it, try it or learn about it.   


**Possible short questions of narrative:** r/CryptoCurrency Moons are quite unknown to the general cryptoverse joe.

* But how much unknown is it?
* Isn't it listed on exchanges and traded already?
* Aren't people already earning it via monthly distributions and thus MOON is available to everyone?   
**Possible short answers:** 
* A lot.
* Yes.
* And yes. It is available, but not many know about it, partially because it is still not listed on many lists, websites or exchanges.

# 1. DEXes

Moon can be traded in three ""decentralised"" exchanges (DEXes).

* 1A: RCPswap(dot)com It was the first dex (It seems down today, don't know if it still works)
* 1B: moon(dot)nano(dot)trade A dex to trade Moons for Nano. 
* 1C: Sushiswap 3rd dex. It is now the go to option with a big MOON/E TH liquidity pool.

Still Moons can't be traded in other Dexes, multichain dexes or aggregators. Two examples: ""1inch"", ""OpenOcean"". Of course it is also up to these dexes to add support for Arbitrum Nova but Moons are still not available everywhere.

# 2. CEXes

Moon can be traded in two centralised exchanges (CEXes)

* 2A: Gate(dot)io
* 2B: MEXC

Two ok exchanges with miriads of tokens and coins. Still the big hitters haven't listed MOON. There are rumours about Kraken enlisting it some time ""soonish"", but not a fact yet. Every listing of a coin in a single cex from the bigger ones, had some effect on price (for better or worse) during 2021 and 2022. Examples of some CEXes: Binance, coinbase, Bybit, Bitfinex, Cucoin, etc.

# 3. Market Watchers / Websites

MOON is now tracked on both main Market Watcher websites:

* 3A: Coingecko
* 3B: CoinMarketCap

But still, this is were MOON is still cherry-picked and thus quite absent from most pther similar sites. Point #3 is the one that magnifies this narrative. Websites and applications that ""watch"" the market, like cryptobubbles(dot)net or blockchain(dot)com haven't Moon in their search results. These two are just an example. Another android only app I am using, hasn't moons available. And probably there could be another 10 examples here.

# 4. CHATGPT and other bots

Moons are also highly invisible to CHATGPT conversations in general and when talking about crypto / investments, unless you point any of these powerful chat bots towards Moons anyway. ""Our MOONs are AI resistant.."" (/s to soften a bit this narrative)

# 5. (MC) Market Cap Top coins

* 5A: 2000
* 5B: 1000
* 5C: 500
* 5D: 200
* 5E: 100 
* 5F: 50 
* 5G: 20 
* 5F: 10

This is both an effect of not being listed everywhere (and generally of not having high traction, not enough interest in Moons as other coins) but also reinforces Moons' secluding state. 

&#x200B;

By CoinMarketCap, MOON stands in the \~3000 rank. So no tier achieved yet in this marketwatch site.

By Coingecko, Moons just days ago standed at \~650, and since 3 dyas ago and at time of writing and posting this post, MOON was at \~557-590. So in this market watch site, we have reached tier #5B and closely eyeing #5C. Every time it even briefly reaches a tier from the short list above, more people will learn about it. Imagine all positive and negative aspects of MOON entering #5C top 100 coins. 

# 6. Twitter

Twitter cryptoverse are also still mainly ignorant. Just search for Moon posts there and see how little comments and likes there are. Imagine if weird cryptoTwitter ""Experts"" start shilling $MOON. Or even Elon picks up the meme or value... Thankfully, still not yet...  

# 7. Other Social Media

Instagram, TikTok and quite Youtube too. Not many posts yet. Yet...

  


***tldr;*** MOON isn't listed everywhere, it is somewhat still secluded, a niche small alt cap, thus it will/might be learnt by more people as time passes and thus its MC will grow significantly.

&#x200B;

***Disclaimer:*** *I believe that MOON and* r/CryptoCurrency *have to keep growing in inner values so as that MOON price doesn't just rise sharply and just reflects a ghost shell, dead on the inside or way smaller than what coin and subrredit deserve.* 

*Towards this direction, I personally believe that two years of value growth is currently reflected as a sum. Things that contributed towards this: organization with CCIP numbering, polls, steep moderation rules and ability of moderators, good use of flairs, 3rd external sites (like ccmoons, moonplace(dot)io), parallel (chains) subreddits (Meta, Moons, memes), defi liquidity pool, etc.*

29,Liquidity Measures by Central Banks,11wc4q7,"A coalition of Central Banks just announced coordinated action to enhance liquidity through U.S. dollar swap lines. This includes:

🇺🇸 US Federal Reserve
🇪🇺 European Central Bank
🇨🇦 Bank of Canada
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Bank of England
🇯🇵 Bank of Japan
🇨🇭 Swiss National Bank

During the financial crisis following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the funding markets dried up because of an extreme aversion to risk.

Under these circumstances it became difficult for euro area banks to obtain US dollars to fund their USD-denominated assets. To prevent disruptions, such as banks having to sell assets abruptly and thus provoking extreme price movements, the ECB and the Federal Reserve set up a currency swap line, allowing the ECB/Eurosystem to provide US dollars to banks located in the euro area.

Many of these currency agreements act mainly as a safety net and have never been activated. 

This statement came just hours after Swiss authorities orchestrated an emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.

Credit Suisse — one of the 30 most important financial banks was bleeding money last week after investors and customer confidence collapsed.

If banks are under stress, they might be reluctant to lend. As result we could see credit become more expensive and less available.

And Swap Lines will allow a central bank to obtain foreign currency from the central bank that issues it, and distribute it to commercial banks in their country.

From Monday through at least the end of April, the Fed and other central banks will make dollars available on a daily basis, rather than weekly.

30,It's better to treat your crypto like an investment rather than a lover.,11wc0c8,"Crypto is funny in that there are so many different projects promising to do so many different things that there is a corner for literally every type of person or enthusiast. This has caused quite a bit of tribalism where people get so attached to certain projects, coins or even the dev team and in some cases all 3!

This is just a friendly reminder that not all dev teams are honest, in this space it takes time to build a reputation and most have either failed at trying or turned out to be outright scams. Then there are those that have scammed their community but the devout followers still cling to old promises and it's quite sad in some cases. 

This is the nature of a speculative market that is constantly expanding and growing in multiple sectors and directions. Treating crypto like an investment takes emotions out of it, it helps keep perspective like particular price points you want to take profit at etc. This will help you towards tangible real world goals. Simply gambling and then hoping it works can lead to disappointment and a sense of failure.

Also, a final thought... Crypto is so fast moving and speculative that unless a dev team can deliver what they say their coin is ' solving ' or doing then it's best to treat it as a speculation. If you buy a car, you don't buy it because it'll be able to unlock certain features in 5 years, you buy as is. Maybe crypto isn't a car, but a lot of dev teams act like the bad product they're peddling is complete and want you to trust them while they take your money upfront. And in the real world, very few people are worth trusting with your finances. Sorry if this sounded a bit dad'ish, but some dev teams can make a crappy product sound groundbreaking via clever wording and bold advertising.",Socialinfluencing,139,45,0.77
31,Portfolio rebalancing?,11wbqt3,"Most of us here DCA (or, as in my case, try to). Many plan on taking profits by DCAing out during the bull, when their target price is finally met. There is plenty of in-depth backtesting of vanilla and weighed DCA strategies in this subreddit. However, I hardly ever hear people talk about rebalancing and never read a post analyzing such strategy.

For those who don't know, rebalancing practically means starting with a portfolio where each asset has a fixed allocation, say 50% BTC and 50% USD (in USD equivalent) and revise it periodically, selling part of the assets that are in excess to buy the other ones (nothing prevents, clearly, from DCAing into the assets, so rebalancing shouldn't be considered an alternative strategy, but rather a complementary one). In case of a portfolio consisting of a crypto and a fiat currency or a stable coin, this essentially means taking profits if the price of the crypto has gone up in the meantime, and buying more if the price has gone down. Of course, when doing this, one must be aware of the fact that each rebalancing might involve one or multiple taxable event, as well as be subject to fees (but that's the same as DCAing out).

Time for some questions now... Have you ever tried this in any form? If so, what is your experience? Has anyone performed any backtesting of this strategy?

Personally, I have tried a few times, but I have never been that consistent with it (even less than with my DCA).",Plus-Ad4019,90,9,0.72

We all have to consider the risk of damage to our back up or loss. Its usually just a peice of paper anyway. 
One good countermeasures is to store your seed in multiple locations this is likely at a family members house. 
But again this creates additional risk as now you have many copies in ""unsecure"" locations potentially. 
Maybe that electrician your mom called finds it in her attic. 

There's a very simple solution here which I thought was obvious, but turns out many aren't aware, so hence this post.

Just scramble your seed words into a random order and keep note on how to unscramble them.

For example your seed is.

1. Truck

2. State

3. House

4. Golf


Write it in random order.

1. State

2. Golf

3. Truck

4. House

Your solution note.

1=3 

2=1 

3=4 

4=2 


Your solution note can easily be kept safe stored online in an email or any other cloud storage. It's useless on its own.
The physical copy of your seed can also be safely stored anywhere with no risk of you losing your crypto should someone find it by accident.

Can someone just guess your seed if they had the 24 words? No. 

There are 620 sextillion different combinations of 24 words. That's alot.

34,Try to not update things while you are unknown wifi (like a hotel wifi),11wb8tp,"So there recently was a story about a very targeted attack on exact people. In this case, an senior executive of a large electronics manufacture went to Japan on a business trip and he stayed at a hotel. He connected to the WiFi and enter in his room number to gain access.

After a bit, his browser said it had an update. Which he installed. This update was malware. 

What happened was hackers did a phishing campaign against the hotel to get into the hotel servers. So they knew exactly who was staying in what room, and then they got into the WiFi gear which allowed them to send a fixed software update that contained a stolen digital signature to the target computer. The malware would wait months before connecting with the hackers and downloading more modules. 

&#x200B;

The hacker group has successfully breached a number of gov groups including Russia, USA, and China.  They went after many higher end companies. 

&#x200B;

While these are highly highly targeted attacks. The biggest thing to note is it's best to 

1. make sure the network you are joining is real. Evil twin attacks are used to trick users into giving up wifi passwords, also fake networks can act as a man in the middle. Where you connect to the hackers wifi, their wifi connects to the real one. The hacker just copies all the traffic going to and from. Sometimes even injecting stuff if they want.
2. Avoid doing updates while connected to unknown WiFi. IF YOU MUST, a trick is to use a VPN. You will want the device to connect as soon as it hits the net. What this does is the device if setup right it makes it nearly impossible for the hackers to send a update payload if the device is ONLY looking and accepting through the VPN and ignoring LAN. Personally I like PIA and there is ways to get it to do this. I personally like PIA because they don't keep logs and this has been tested many times in courts. They even were kicked out of Russia due to this.

# Why is this important for crypto? 

Simple. While at first you might think you will never be targeted. Little mistakes can cause you to be. Maybe it's simple as a co-worker that knows you have crypto and has a big mouth, maybe someone was shoulder surfing and seen you check your portfolio, etc. It really doesn't matter

If the hacker knows you use a given program they can screw with. Maybe it's something you use for fun, maybe it's some 3D modeling thing, or whatever. If there is a known security flaw with it. This can be used to do some nasty things.",crua9,92,35,0.83

when devs get criticism or even genuine concern about their projects whether it be utility or future possible use cases, they usually just call it FUD; so they could avoid answering and just leave the people concerned about the future of their investment/possible investment.

we all know that spreading fear, uncertainty & doubt is a real thing and can influence a lot of people; but generally, when the devs can’t deliver answers to criticism/questions is a red flag.
we have seen that happen few times. devs keep calling criticism FUD to keep stalling until they pull the rug

38,"The truth about TA. Why people think they can time the market, why they draw lines on graphs, why some of them end up being right, and how you can avoid being another monkey with a keyboard.",11w6cb7,"You are a biological machine designed to find patterns.

You need to find patterns to survive, it's the same process that makes you see faces in random objects. It's what drives conspiracy theorists to believe lizards run the world. Our survival is predicated on pattern recognition; when the weather changes, what paths bears take, where the berries grow - it's the most fundamental driver in how you ended up as a monkey with a keyboard on Reddit.

In nature there's two pattern recognition errors you can make, a Type 1 error and Type 2 error. If there's a rustle in the bushes a Type 1 error (false positive) leads you to suspect a tiger where there isn't one. You run away but live to shitpost another day. A Type 2 error (false negative) is to ignore the rustle despite the tiger. Monkeys that make Type 2 errors don't survive to give birth to monkeys with keyboards.

There's not much real debate when we look at the long term studies of traders and firms. They fucking suck dude. Markets are a random walk that trend upwards due to FIAT printing and productivity increases. Any pattern that might have worked gets a counter party that cancels it out. You can't  even get better at trading, since improving at something requires repetitive mistakes and corrections with a limited number of controllable variables.

Despite that, millions of talking monkeys stare at charts looking for patterns like we were designed to do. We find spurious correlations, then we make predictions. If we flip the coin correctly we get a dopamine hit. If we flip the coin correctly a few times in a row we look successful, we give ourselves credit for our decision making, we start a YouTube channel, we get a following because we've been right in the past, we're even fucking rich.

Due to the law of large numbers some of us HAVE to continue to be right. Somebody always wins in a game of heads or tails. Every right guess leads to confirmation bias, any wrong guess creates an addictive form of itermittent reinforcement and is wilfully ignored. The monkeys that win the flip a lot and hide their losses the best get a big following.

Maybe they end up running a hedge fund, some of those hedge funds are successful for predicting the right side of the coinflip. They raise billions of dollars. A few of those billion dollar hedgefunds are successful, they win more flips and grow to enormous sizes.

Eventually they end up on the wrong side of a few flips, they're Almeda capital, they're 3AC. Their predictions don't work and they get wiped out COMPLETELY. They start a fly wheel because it's just been bad luck. They leverage to the tits. They get it wrong and then things blow the fuck up.

Avoid the trap. Ignore the charts and the dumbass arrows. Buy over time, sit on your hands, fight your instincts, eventually reap the rewards from the increase in productivity, network growth and FIAT printing. The richest bitcoiners aren't the ones who traded, they're the ones who fucking went to jail and couldn't sell. They just needed to wait and let the market do it's work.",chance_waters,123,26,0.62

Not only does it have use case with one of the largest subs but also has potential of becoming overriding Reddit CryptoCurrency.   Bricks definitely more speculative and I’m not even goi g to tackle the donut storage task if I ever get any.  

Advice or help on safest way to use cold storage would be appreciated.  I’ve recently dug up some other posts regarding same but found t find the arbitrium nova specifically.  I believe this is going to be an increasingly popular question.   Of course any other pointers appreciated.

40,10 million Moons are owned by addresses that have been completely dormant for over a year,11w63dy,"I looked at all addresses currently holding moons, and found that \~10M moons are held in addresses that have been dormant for over a year.

\~8.9M of these were only active between 1-2 years ago, and \~1.1M moons are in addresses were only active 2+ years ago.

**I define a ""dormant"" address as one that hasn't sent or received moons in a certain time period.** Some other websites only look at transactions from an address when calculating ""dormant"" ones, but I think it doesn't make a lot of sense for Moons, since many users who are still receiving them each month but don't send them out of their vault should be counted as ""active"".

Below lists the breakdown of moon holdings by address latest activity. In this chart, I exclude the Reddit-owned addresses (since you could make the argument that these are either dormant or active) and the 0xdead address used for burning moons.

41,"The transition from ""Groceries used to cost USD 10 per household, it is now USD 100"" to ""Groceries back then used to worth USD 100, it is now USD 10"" if it was running on a deflationary model. Here's a simplistic take on inflationary towards deflationary currencies, and why I think it is crucial.",11w5yda,"One of the issues we are facing is overproduction, and overconsumption. The current inflationary fiat model was created to make sure that your Fiat today would be worth less in the future, hence, you need to spend it to protect the worth, or the system itself encourages you to spend. The closest example would be on how much home prices have risen since the 1950s.

&#x200B;

*1950s: Median home value USD 7,354*

*1950s: Inflation-adjusted to 2020 USD: USD 79,063*

*2020: Median home value: USD 336,900*

&#x200B;

The structure of fiat itself would force vendors to eventually increase their price, to test the ceiling. This is dependent on the demand, and supply. There are other factors involved, but this thread aims to just narrow down the inflationary nature of fiat currencies.

Hoping for the government to lower the price down will not work. It's just against the system. That can only work if the method of payment is based on an appreciating asset. USD, EUR, and other currencies are inflationary. The inflationary nature is forcing is to spend, and consume, and for some of us- overconsuming or overbuying what we need.

This has created businesses which are fixated with growth, instead of sustainability. This has created banks that relies on forecast instead of maintaining its current assets. What Cryptocurrency has allowed us to do is- it has given the accessibility to normal people like us to access appreciating asset which only the rich were able to access back then. Owning BTC, or other cryptocurrencies is now giving us similar perks towards holding a piece of land, or a house- with better liquidity, albeit for different functions.

The story of 10,000 BTC for pizzas will still ring true, and the nature of the currency itself is deterring away from people to use BTC as a form of payment. But here's the thing- this can be good. The adverse effect will eventually happen if deflationary currencies is introduced and adopted to the rest of the world. We might eventually slow down our consumption, and people/businesses would eventually slow down to focus on saving money instead of spending it.

Hence, several indicators are expected to happen. 

\- Wages appraisal would see you getting paid less instead of more, because your currencies are going to worth more in the future. 

\- Businesses would focus more on currencies' retention instead of growth, because the value of the currencies would be the 'asset' or expansion plan.

42,"What do you consider to be ""mass adoption""?",11w5rnb,"The way I see it, there are 2 reasons for someone to hold crypto:

1. Hold it as an investment, meaning hold it as a store of value, or to make money (or both)
2. Use it to transact, or with certain coins, use it to participate in some part of the ecosystem

However, getting the average person interested enough to do either of these is not easy.

Take investing for an example. When you venture out of the online communities surrounding trading and investing, you can see that most people either

1. Don't have money to invest
2. Simply auto-contribute to retirement accounts
3. If they have enough, hire a financial advisor manage their money for them

So for a lot of people, if you want to get them to invest in crypto, you not only have to get them to start investing on their own, but you need them to think investing in crypto is a good idea (and we all know crypto has an image problem).

The other reason to hold crypto is to use it for transactions or to participate in the ecosystem of a coin or token.

For transactions, while I know plenty of people use it in countries with absurdly high inflation, and to send money to people in other countries, there currently isn't a very large need for the average person to use it to transact.

Regarding the use of crypto in the ecosystem of a coin, there's a whole different set of challenges with that, assuming someone gets past the image problem of crypto and wants to start using it. Not only does it generally have a higher barrier to entry in knowledge and funds, the potential to make a mistake or get scammed when transferring crypto between different wallets and chains is much higher. I would guess that the average person in this sub doesn't even do this often (including me), so it's a pretty daunting task for a newcomer to crypto. And don't even get me started on taxes.

&#x200B;

UBS is one of the largest financial institutions in the world, with a strong presence in both traditional banking and investment banking. By taking over Credit Suisse, UBS will become an even more dominant player in the financial industry. This could lead to increased investment in many different areas, including blockchain technology.

&#x200B;

UBS has been bullish on blockchain technology in the past, and there are reasons to believe that this trend will continue with the takeover of Credit Suisse. Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize many different areas of the financial industry, from payments to securities trading to asset management.

&#x200B;

With the increased resources and expertise that UBS will have access to after the takeover, it's possible that we will see even more investment in blockchain technology. This could lead to the development of new and innovative blockchain solutions that could benefit many different industries.

&#x200B;

Of course, as with any major development in the financial industry, there are risks involved. The takeover of Credit Suisse could lead to job losses and other negative consequences. But overall, it's an exciting time for those who are interested in the potential of blockchain technology.

&#x200B;

So what does this mean for Banano Coin? Well, Banano Coin is a cryptocurrency that is based on the NANO blockchain. While it's impossible to say for sure how the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse will impact Banano Coin specifically, it's possible that increased investment in blockchain technology could lead to more institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space overall.

&#x200B;

As always, it's important to do your own research before making any investment decisions.

So I belive most of us already know what to look on a currency. Even if you're a starter this sub offers you really good guides on how to DYOR.

But unless you have a ball of crystal, projects outside top100 have always a ''gamble'' factor when you invest in them. 

And that's because **there are many information that isn't public!**

**Secretly lending customer funds, market-making against their own customers, intricate webs of counterparty relationships, issuing their own tokens and distributing them to insiders, and so on.**

None of that nonsense can be researched, and it is these that cause the most significant movements in cryptocurrency. ""DYOR"" works only when the market is at least partially transparent. Free markets can only function when everyone is (roughly) on the same playing field. THAT is why publicly traded companies must issue regular earnings reports that are open to the public, and why financial institutions must undergo third-party audits.

47,OHM from Olympus Dao is never coming back. Or is it?,11w37rg,"You guys remember OHM right? It was the smash hit of the 2021 bull run. During Q4 the roar for this project was euphoric. Everyone and their grandmother was trying ot get some OHm and sOHM. Then late that year a proposal came about for a new token called gOHM which became a governance token  which replaced wsOHM as part of the v2 migration. gOHM wraps sOHM V2, which allows you to use sOHM V2 on different blockchains. When v2 was announced you could feel the confusion on twitter, reddit and all over. Once the migration happened people sold their OHM like their life depended on it and the price of OHM crashed from a whopping $1,320 per token to what is noa mere $10 per token. It has been flatlined at this price during the entire bear market.

Olympus DAO is a community-owned, decentralized and censorship-resistant reserve currency that is asset-backed, deeply liquid and used widely across Web3. Its treasury balance  currently sits at $237,978,889

The dilemma Olympus Dao claims it wants to solve. Pay attention here because this is at the crux of a lot of issues we have in crypto.

"" Dollar-pegged stablecoins have become an essential part of crypto due to their lack of volatility as compared to tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether. Users are comfortable with transacting using stablecoins knowing that they hold the same amount of purchasing power today vs. tomorrow. But this is a fallacy. The dollar is controlled by the US government and the Federal Reserve. This means a depreciation of the dollar also means a depreciation of these stablecoins. Olympus aims to solve Web3’s reliance on centralized, censorable stablecoin assets by creating a non-pegged reserve currency called OHM that is backed by a basket of assets. Olympus actively utilizes its Treasury as a counterbalance to the market  and to grow the econOHMy.""

This is key because stable coin regulaton is undoubtedly coming soon and coming with sury and the dollar value is quickly dropping so does it make a little sense now? 

Personally I think OHM is a legit project but it got way too confusing for people when the migration to v2 took place. People did no understand the logic between rebasing tokens like sOHm vs gOHM and OHM and wsOHM. It was simply too much. Plus add the gwei prices at that time and it was tough to stay in. So people sold. The prisoners dilemma was too much for the common Joe investor who literally came in to just ape and run out the door to stay.

IMO OHM has a legitimate chance to make a strong comeback. Few project do. Some that come to mind are VeChain, XLM, Loopring, ICP, Avalanche and so many others. Some have actually perished.

OHM can make a comeback because the defi ecosystem may need it and WEB3 can use it. Remeber this part in a year or two.  ***Provide the growing Web3 financial ecosystem with a censorship-resistant currency that preserves purchasing power, has deep liquidity, is trusted and used widely as a unit of account.***

The first thing you should do is check if your are getting any ARB tokens air dropped to your wallet, you can check that in the link below.

[https://arbitrum.foundation/](https://arbitrum.foundation/)

you simply connect your wallet which will add the Arbitrum One network and will then give you the option to check eligibility.

**Where will you be able to sell ARB token?**

The current centralized exchanges that have confirmed they will be trading ARB on the 23rd

* MEXC - ARB/USDT
* Huobi - ARB/USDT & ARB/USDD
* Bybit - ARB/USDT & ARB/USDC
* OKX - ARB/USDT & ARB/USDC
* Bitrue - coming soon but not confirmed to be available on the 23rd

You can also check different DEXs to see if anybody has set up a pool for you to be able to sell ARB but make sure to check the available liquidity so you wont swap $1,000 worth of ARB for $1.00 worth of USCD. 

some of the bigger DEXs that support Arbitrum one

* SushiSwap
* GMX
* Curve
* Uniswap
* Balancer

**ARB token price predictions**

nobody really knows but since Arbitrum is the 4th largest chain by TVL people are estimating anywhere from $0.60 to $10.00 with the majority believing it will probably be around $1.50 a token.

**What to expect after the drop**

We can see what happened with the Optimism airdrop to try and get an idea of what the ARB airdrop will look like.

The sharp drop you see on the left was over the course of about two days, the price dropped from $2.89 to $1.20 then continued falling for about a month reaching a low of $0.45 and then about two months after the drop stared going back up not reaching the $3.00 range until February of 2023.

We can pretty confidently assume that the ARB token price will drop incredible fast as the majority will sell right away and will probably continue to drop for at least a month. If you wish to sell you will need to move incredibly fast to try and beat the bots and users who will be waiting.

**Should you sell?**

we will continue using Optimism as our example - Optimism first Airdrop was June 2022 and they surprised users of the Optimism L2 with a second airdrop January 2023. 

We don't know how the ARB token will perform or if Arbitrum will follow Optimism doing a second airdrop so it's really up to you if you choose to sell your ARB tokens.

53,Vitalik Buterin gave some advice on how to keep your crypto safe these days,11w1xfx,"
On Reddit, Vitalik Buterin talked about the
importance of multisig wallets and social
recovery wallets.

Vitalik said in his post that: 

""A close cousin of multisig wallets is social
recovery
wallets, where a single key can be used to
sign
transactions but if that key is lost, a group of
keys held
by other people can be used to recover the
funds. Social
recovery wallets are much easier than
multisig wallets
to use, especially with the rise of ERC-4337
account
abstraction.""

""Both multisig wallets and social recovery wallets rely on
a concept of guardians: a set of N addresses, typically
held by other people, of which any M can approve an
operation (eg. one could set N=6 and M=4). In the case
of a multisig wallet, each transaction must be signed
off on by M of the N guardians. In the case of a social
recovery wallet, there is a single key that can sign
transactions, but if that key is lost, M of the N guardians
must sign a message to reset the key.""

If you are intersted in reading more, you can find Vitalik's post on the Ethereum subreddit.
It's a good read!

Do we really think achieving a marketcap amongst the likes of MATIC, ADA, etc. is possible, or does the timeframe need to be extended for a meaningful enough market share?

I'm curious what the community here thinks, as times right now seem to be about as dynamic as they have been all crypto winter. Considering the global economy running so hot, do we see the stage set for a breakout chain in the making or is it going to be a nothingburger in a sea of nothingburgers?

55,A Multichain User's Perspective - Solanashaming,11w10hs,"Let me start off by saying that Arbitrum has quickly become my favorite chain currently, and I use several chains every single day including Cosmos, Eth, EVMs, L2s, and yes, Solana. I'll try to give a level-headed, good-faith explanation of why I still think Solana is important. I hold no Solana but I hold eth and arb alts. I'm talking about the chain here.

&#x200B;

* It appears that many in the community are focused on the price aspect of cryptocurrencies, and it seems that a majority only engage with a single or couple of blockchains just to hold coins, or are otherwise content with paying high fees (such as a crazy \~$3 fee for listing an NFT for sale or the $8-10 for a single trade on Ethereum currently). There's more that we can do with blockchains outside of finance. 
* While Ethereum is more decentralized than Solana, and Arbitrum is not as decentralized as Ethereum, Solana can still serve as an effective gateway to blockchains (not just crypto) for millions of newcomers from platforms like Binance and other centralized entities that have even more centralized control and risky market dominance than less decentralized chains like Solana and Arbitrum/Optimism.
* Millions of users may not be able to afford Ethereum or even Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, which, despite not being as decentralized as Ethereum, are still significantly more expensive, less built out and more complicated to use than Solana. 
* For reference, a single Solana tx is about 1/10 to 1/100th the cost of a single Arbitrum tx, and in many countries with high populations but weaker currencies, that adds up.
* 1 Ethereum tx is about 144,000 joules while 1 Solana tx is about 3,290 joules. BTC is a WHOPPING 5 billion joules (not an argument against btc).
* It's important to acknowledge that Solana was previously influenced by SBF, but his sway has diminished, and there's fresh hope and resurgence in the Sol community, which comprises many similar individuals as the Ethereum and Cosmos communities.
* If you're not involved in DeFi, Solana's advantages can still be beneficial, and downtime might not affect you significantly. More importantly, it allows you to participate in the cryptocurrency space in ways that others may not be able to.
* For example, have you explored high frequency NFT lending/borrowing protocols? Or participated in a Twitch-style collective Pokémon game where everyone votes on-chain for the next move? What about engaging in high-frequency on-chain trading, executing dozens of transactions per minute?

It's worth considering giving these experiences a try on the Solana blockchain, or at least not shaming those that do. This way, when such activities become more affordable and accessible on your preferred blockchain, you'll already have valuable experience and an edge over others. 

TLDR: let's acknowledge the trade-offs between decentralization and accessibility, and explore the diverse possibilities offered by different blockchains. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and robust cryptocurrency ecosystem that benefits everyone. The continued widespread use of Solana, despite a particularly challenging year that could have killed many other chains, attests to its vibrant developer and user community, who interact with each other directly and often intersect. 

Instead of dismissing other blockchain platforms or criticizing those who are exploring them, why don't we broaden our horizons and have some fun while learning about the diverse possibilities that exist within the cryptocurrency ecosystem?

The Excitement is enticing and contagious as Algorand locks in one partnership after another, but behind the scenes... **A Series of Unfortunate Events** are Begining to Unwind, and what was once a promising blockchain to laugh and make jokes about - is quietly becoming a disaster for investors.

*This post is not a technical breakdown of Algorand nor is this post meant to fud the future of Algorand. This post is about the absolute disaster that continues to unravel for investors of the Algorand Blockchain.*

\------------------------------

# I. A Brief Introduction to Algorand:

If someone told you about Algorand they probably also told you [it was founded by Silvio Micali](https://www.algorand.com/about/our-history)  ""a cryptography pioneer, Turing award winner and MIT professor"".  Algorand launched in 2019 and hails itself as a [Pure Proof of Stake](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/proof-of-stake-vs-pure-proof-of-stake-consensus) (PPOS). The most notable difference from traditional Proof of Stake (POS), is that the creator of the next block is selected randomly irrespective of their total stake. As the name implies this approach is touted by Algorand supporters as a more fair and decentralized version of POS.

\------------------------------

# II. The Beginning of an Inflationary Nightmare for Investors:

Like most crypto projects Algorand absolutely blew up in 2021, it started the year under $.40 and it ended the yearover 4x around \~$1.65. However unlike most crypto projects that peaked in early November Algorand peaked in September.

https://preview.redd.it/0jgjkqekoloa1.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0540237e29d4dfa335b523e55567438f4d6bac96

What sounds like an interesting side note, holds a much darker truth for investors - [Algorand inflated by 533% in 2021](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/vu26qy/the_great_algo_mass_inflation_event_of_2021_the/), as the circulating supply jumped from 1.19B to 6.37B - and [12% in 2022](https://messari.io/asset/algorand/chart/sply-circ) from 6.37B to 7.14B. If you line up the graph for the increase in circulating supply to price, you can see the September 2021 peak lined up with a large surge in the circulating supply and a steady drop in price since.

\------------------------------

# III. A Controversial Change in Leadership

In [January of 2022](https://np.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/sh3sjs/its_been_two_days_since_sean_lee_was_quietly/) the prior CEO of the Algorand Foundation was quietly ousted from the company, and replaced with the [new CEO](https://www.algorand.foundation/news/staci-warden-ceo) Staci Warden. The replacement has been incredibly controversial inside the Algorand Community as the new Foundation CEO thought one of the major priorities for the Algorand Foundation was to focus on PR.

[https:\/\/twitter.com\/StaciW\_DC\/status\/1499202881647489025](https://preview.redd.it/wcte440qsqoa1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ecde4f2134230b85311494f3d0ec6eb991e64a66)

Additionally [she's been largely criticized](https://np.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/xfillm/please_calm_down/) for acting childish and immature in her public statements - with statements that are meant to create ""baseless hype"" which leads to Algorand believers holding even larger underwater bags. If you have ever heard of Staci before it's probably for her, [""Nike"" tweet](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/10ex14q/ceo_of_the_algorand_foundation_decides_to_troll/).

https://preview.redd.it/ds8gyyfxuqoa1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=593304e3f54223d61b871f44680296f7da09aaed

This one word tweet, lead people to believe big things were imminent for Algorand Investors with a potential Nike Partnership. Instead it was later revealed that Staci had hired a former Nike Executive as the Chief Marketing Officer for Algorand.

\------------------------------

# IV. A Disaster in ""Marketing"" - Part 1: An Introduction

If you are familiar with Algorand Tokenomics you probably know, Algorand has a max supply of 10B and the beginning Centralization of Tokens with the Algorand team was one of the worst things about Algorand.

https://preview.redd.it/1r9ia3fgipoa1.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a111431c6627db5d07221895633d3beaf95d996

As you can see, Algorand itself was one of the initial largest holder of Algorand. When a Crypto organization needs to raise funds - they do that by selling their tokens, and that's exactly what the Algorand Foundation did. To the Foundations credit, they make bi-annual Transparency Reports that detail how much they sold and sometimes what those funds were used for. Below is a breakdown of the sales from October 2020 - September 2022 time period. Links to Transparency Reports information was gathered from: [1](https://www.algorand.foundation/transparency-report-march-2021), [2](https://www.algorand.foundation/transparency-report-september-2021), [3](https://www.algorand.foundation/transparency-report-march-2022), [4](https://www.algorand.foundation/transparency-report-oct-2022) .

[Numbers in Algo](https://preview.redd.it/maa0hbvxupoa1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6ea363ae8836441bd799ab88b589530f09c95bd5)

&#x200B;

In the Past two years the Algorand Foundation has sold 228M Algo and Paid their Board of Directors another 3.65M Algo. **Important:** these numbers do not include Algo given out for for ecosystem development - That includes another \~400M Algo over two years, some of which may have also been sold.

# A Disaster in ""Marketing"" - Part 2: Partnerships

The past few years have been huge for Partnerships with Algorand, it seemed like every week the Algorand Foundation was announcing a new partnership. But most of these were just glorified real-world Sponsorships that Algorand paid for, that came with an Agreement to do do something on the Algorand blockchain, like FIFAs NFT flop.

https://preview.redd.it/df9n4vqiypoa1.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7e0bace807bcde0000ec85d82e1798f79237ef71

Announced in May 2022, [Algorand became the official blockchain partner of FIFA](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/03/algorand-scores-fifa-partnership-algo-prices-surge/). Immediately after the announcement the price of Algorand spiked 20%, but what investors had hoped would be game changing for the Algorand network - ended up as just another disappointment. In September 2022, FIFA launched an NFT project on the Algorand Blockchain - with over 205,000 mints, at a cost of $5 each and low resale interest: the project just ended up being a further $1M cash grab for FIFA.

[The Algorand Logo was not on display as a partner during the Fifa world cup.](https://twitter.com/StaciW_DC/status/1595149753066541056) Additionally there was not an ad or Algorand TV Spot during the world cup, something Algorand supporters had hoped to see.

# A Disaster in ""Marketing"" - Part 3: Advertisements

Under the guidance of the new Foundation CEO Staci and a pivot to focus on PR - Algorand the ""Greenest Blockchain"", [planned a huge marketing stunt for Earth Day 2022](https://crast.net/37927/times-square-will-go-dark-tonight-to-prove-that-crypto-doesnt-have-to-be-bad-for-the-planet/). They rented the time square billboards for one hour to black them out. Then they intermittently flashed them Green with the Algorand logo and text about how Algo energy consumption compares to BTC.

[Source: https:\/\/shortyawards.com\/7th-impact\/algorand-earth-day?trk=public\_post\_feed-article-content](https://preview.redd.it/tw2z5l925qoa1.jpg?width=5760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f305036525eca6c06eac573086aaf4624039ea6f)

Of course the money for this publicity stunt, had to come from somewhere, and that money came from dumping Algo on Investors. From April - September 2022. [The Algorand Foundation spent $22.2M](https://www.algorand.foundation/transparency-report-oct-2022) on ""Marketing and other forms of ecosystem promotion"" which was raised by selling Algorand. In the prior six months, [they only spent 9M](https://www.algorand.foundation/transparency-report-march-2022) in the same category.

\------------------------------

# V. MyAlgo Hack and TinyMan Hack

In late February MyAlgo was hacked and some of the largest holders on [Algorand saw over $9M](https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1630375691886686208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1630375691886686208%7Ctwgr%5Ecb20de268b2b2cec1da75a66ef8374d10f637ef2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fmyalgo-users-urged-to-withdraw-as-cause-of-9-2m-hack-remains-unknown) in Crypto drained. A week later smaller holders on MyAlgo also started to see their crypto drained in what at the time seemed like Bots draining wallets.

[MyAlgo will be releasing](https://coinedition.com/myalgo-to-unveil-preliminary-findings-regarding-the-9m-hack/) **the Preliminary Findings on the Hack tomorrow, Mar. 20th 2023.**

In January 2022 TinyMan was hacked and $3M was drained from Algorand ASAs (tokens). [Source](https://cryptopotato.com/3-million-lost-as-an-algorand-based-decentralized-trading-platform-exploited/)

\------------------------------

With all of these problems and the continuous sell pressure from the Algorand Foundation - Algo's price has continued to drop over the bear market. One Algorand was selling for nearly \~$2.40 in Sep. 2021, and is now selling for $.22. If Algorand tech can turn around the nightmare that is occurring for Algorand investors is another question.... but one thing is certain - A series of Unfortunate Events has made Investing in Algorand an absolute nightmare.

**TLDR**: What was once a loved project shilled endlessly by this sub has quickly and quietly turned into a nightmare for anyone still left in the project.

Edit: Since some people think analyzing the failures of Algorand over the past 18 month is ""hating Algo and Fud"", please read the post again. The inevitable comments about ""This sub hates Algo now, I Guess that Means It's Time to Buy"" misses the entire point of this post.",GabeSter,530,500,0.87
58,Why Do LP Fees & APR Fluctuate So Much?,11vzxlf,"LP noob here so forgive me if the answer is obvious to most. The fluctuation in APR and pool fees seems pretty dramatic from a first timer's perspective.

What causes this fluctuation?

Is it determined TVL, daily volume or some other metric?

Since I am not experienced with LPs I am not sure if this is common across all LPs or if it is isolated to specific LPs due to the TVL and daily volume. Seems like a lot of work to adjust the fees and APR, unless of course it is done algorithmically. I suspect it's an algorithm because any kind of manual adjustments seem absolutely insane.

If it is not determined by TVL or daily volume, then what dictates the fluctuation? The only other thing I can think of is the TVL to Market Cap ratio.

""PLBY  Group (PLBY), the parent company of the late Hugh Hefner's Playboy  enterprise, said it took an impairment loss of $4.9 million on the ether  (ETH) it held last year, as crypto winter created a significant decline  in the broader market prices.

The lifestyle and media company said it accepted ether as payments for its “[Rabbitars](https://opensea.io/collection/playboyrabbitars)” non-fungible tokens ([NFT](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-nfts-and-how-do-they-work/)) launched in 2021, which it holds in its balance sheet as digital assets, according to an [annual filing on Thursday](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1803914/000180391423000017/ply-20221231.htm). The value of the digital assets sits at $327,000 as of last year, the filing said.

A [previous filing](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/d9088661-8cbe-4704-92ed-69a9895734fc) shows the company's digital assets, which it refers to as Ethereum, were worth $1.75 million as of Sept. 30, 2022.

The  company explained that the company accounts for its digital assets as  “indefinite-lived intangible assets,” which are subject to impairment  losses if the fair value of the assets fall below their carrying value,  at any time. The impairment losses the company takes on the digital  assets can’t be recovered, even if the fair value of the assets rise  after taking the impairment losses.

“The  market price of one \[ether\] in our principal market ranged from $964 to  $3,813 during the year ended Dec. 31, 2022, but the carrying value of  each Ethereum we held at the end of the reporting period reflects the  lowest price of one Ethereum quoted on the active exchange at any time  since its receipt,” according to the filing. ""Therefore, negative swings  in the market price of Ethereum could have a material impact on the  company's earnings and carrying value, while only time a rise in prices  will impact the company’s earnings positively, is when the Ethereum held  in the balance sheet, are sold at a gain,"" the filing said.

The company [launched its “Rabbitar” NFT project](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/20/2317683/0/en/Playboy-launches-new-NFT-project-Rabbitars.html)  in October 2021, during the peak of the crypto market. Ether, the  native token of the Ethereum blockchain, lost about 60% in value since  October 2021, according to TradingView data.

Earlier  in 2021, Playboy entered into NFT and blockchain technology industry  with its NFT drop called “Liquid Summer,” which is a collection of  digital artworks created in collaboration with the artist Slimesunday.  The collection, which minted in May 2021, features archival photographs  of Playboy model [Lenna Sjööblom](https://www.wired.com/story/finding-lena-the-patron-saint-of-jpegs/) – the so-called “First Lady of the Internet.”

However, these NFT drops weren’t the first foray for the company into the world of digital assets. In 2018, Playboy TV began [accepting bitcoin (BTC) payments](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/14/playboy-tv-to-accept-crypto-payments-for-adult-content/).

As we can see from the price charts of BTC & ETH, other Altcoins are still very volatile, but they are trying to follow the price jump. We are not in a bull market, that's easy to understand, everything is 40-80% down, on prices, but we are not in a desperate bear market, either, 3 months continues green is nothing to sneeze at. 🤔

This chart is a way to represent it, it is estimated that the cost of mining one BTC last year actually was more than the value of that one BTC on spot prices, thus miners were mining in losses. To cover their losses they had to sell their holdings, which further caused the markets to drop, and even their equipments.

After the recent rally to even $27k now, they are finally back to mining in profits and seems they like they are welcoming this situation with open arms.

64,Re-imagining the financial system with cryptocurrencies as the central store of value,11vy9gc,"# The history of our current financial crisis

It is becoming more and more apparent that our current financial system which was built in the 1930's is not fit for the modern times. Here I will try to explain some of the issues with our current economic system and relate it to why it will eventually have to fail. I will then propose how cryptocurrency could be integrated into our current financial system to create a more resilient and fair system for all.

Our story begins in 1933 Franklin Roosevelt it is the time of the great depression. Banks are collapsing for a variety of reasons but a main one was that they had taken a lot of risky bets on the stock market which crashed in 1929 leaving many banks in a bad financial position. This eventually created a run on the banks with them not having enough money to pay out the money people had put in. Now the governments hands were tied because the money they could print was based on the amount of gold they had. This made it impossible for the government to restart the economy by injecting cash into the economy. All of this lead to a complete halt of the financial system. No trade was happening nobody was lending to anyone and nobody was willing to trust banks. Meaning nobody was spending money which caused more businesses to collapse leading to massive unemployment and even less money being spent. The economy was in a death spiral that threatened to actually lead to the death of millions.

This was when Roosevelt intervened by taking the US Dollar of the gold standard. This gave the government the ability to invest in the economy and get it ""unstuck"". The New York Times [quotes](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=980DE1D9143BEF3ABC4851DFB2668388629EDE)  J.P. Morgan saying at the time, “It seems to me clear that the way out of the  depression is to combat and overcome the deflationary forces. Therefore,  I regard the action now taken as being the best possible course under  existing circumstances.”  Basically the best way out of a recession is to follow economic principles. If your money is losing value then it is best to spend it now because in the future it will not be worth as much.

Now this leads us to 2008 the first major financial crisis that threatened to mirror the great depression. Basically wall street has gotten greedy. They found a way to game the system by giving out bad loans and the bundling them together in a flaming ball of trash and claiming they were as solid as gold. During this period banks were making enormous amounts of cash and bankers were getting rich because they did not carry any of the risks for these loans but got fat bonuses for making them. When the system eventually collapsed it threatened to cause another great depression, this time governments and central banks intervened early. They bailed out the banks using tax payer money and managed to prevent another death spiral.

However there was a major difference in the approach this time. Instead of the banks being punished for making bad financial decisions with them becoming bankrupt and the bankers losing their job they received massive bonuses. They then proceeded to take the governments money, tax payers money, our money to just restart gambling right away. How did the banking grift work? Well basically the government said to stave of a depression we need to get people spending. To get people spending we need to make sure people can borrow money. So to make sure banks give out money we will allow the banks to access money for close to 0% interest as well as pump massive amounts of cash into the system through quantitative easing. However, the banks instead of loaning out to people and small businesses realized they could make much more profit by investing this money in large businesses and stocks compared to giving a small business a good loan.

This was the fatal mistake of the government and Satoshi saw it 15 years in advance. He knew that the greed of the bankers would never be satisfied. In a way it was the tale of the frog and the scorpion where the scorpion asks the frog ""can you give me a ride across the river?"" The frog says ""no you will sting me and I will die"". The scorpion responds ""No if I sting you in the river I will drown and nobody wants that."" So the frog lets the scorpion climb on and starts swimming as he gets about half way across he suddenly feels a sharp sting in his back. He laments ""Why did you sting me now we will both die?"" To which the scorpion just responds ""well I'm  a scorpion"".

So now we have the banks receiving essentially free money that they are turning into massive profits for themselves and those with assets in the stock market. Meanwhile the actual economy continues to struggle. People are having their spending power gradually eroded as things creep up in price but there is no change in the wages people receive. This all culminates in what we have today. Another financial crisis, banks are again overexposed to risks from financial downturn despite having over a decade of near perfect conditions to make money. They again threaten and blackmail us with ""well if you don't save us people will earn their hard earned money"". Now with runaway inflation eating at the little money that people are able to earn they again try to blame workers saying you need to cut back you are being to greedy and it is driving inflation.

So what will happen is this loop of banks abusing their position of power in our financial system to create wealth for themselves while knowing that any risks will eventually be covered by the government.

# How Cryptocurrency can create a more just financial system

Now we can see that banks are itself the problem they are a scorpion that will sting us over and over. My question then is well if the taxpayer keeps bailing out banking institutions why do we not get a share in the profit from the risk we take on? My proposal is as follows. The central bank becomes the main creditor of loans giving out the same deals that they give out to banks but instead of the banks turning a huge profit and dumping the risk on the tax payer it would be the state that benefits. They could also direct investment to be of long term social benefits for example by providing good loans to small businesses. The investment strategy would change from maximizing profits to maximizing the good done for the country all while being supervised and guided by the people with people being able to influence where investments are made.

This leaves us with the big question. Now banks are superfluous, no longer needed a lump of fat cut out and discarded. So how would people store their money? Well here is where cryptocurrency finally comes in. People would be able to store their money in cryptocurrency. For people that want to have just a savings account the government will provide a central bank issued cryptocurrency that is equal to a dollar. This reflects the truth that many people want to hold just a dollar and while they will slowly lose value it is what most people want. Furthermore businesses would quickly pop up that would allow you to store your cryptodollars. However, these businesses would not be allowed to do fractional reserve banking, they would have to hold your assets 1:1. This means that they would charge you a fee for this service but this is recommended for a lot of people that do not want the hassle of holding their own money. However, the option would be there to hold it yourself free for ever.

Then finally we get to traditional cryptocurrencies. These would be subject to volatility and trends in market and so on but bitcoin is known to be deflationary and could represent a good investment for the long term. It allows people a safe place to deposit their holdings long term. Additional cryptos with different functionalities could all be available and easily traded in and out off.

# Conclusion

So in summary I think we need to abolish consumer based banks that take consumer deposits and practice fractional reserve banking. Instead it would be replaced by a democratically led investment process where the inhabitants of a country reap the benefits of their economy doing well instead of it being funneled to a wealth few. Consumer banks would be replaced by central bank cryptocurrency that functions just like a US Dollar and people looking to grow their wealth over a long period of time could seamlessly convert in and out of bitcoin as well as other assets suiting their risk tolerance. We deserve a modern financial system that caters to the needs of the many not just the few. Thank you for reading this and I look forward to hearing any comments.",Betaglutamate2,21,5,0.66
65,"You are always ""early"" to Crypto",11vxvxw,"In the past few days I've seen a few posts about being early, not being early, when being early is over, etc.

I've been in the space since 2017 and fully thought I missed the boat. Bought in at around 7 for Bitcoin and started dabbling in ETH at around 300 bucks. Rode Bitcoin all the way to 20k and ETH to 1300 and down again.

Man did I think I had egg on my face. I was way too late and everyone who had bought before 2017, they were the lucky ""early ones"". 

Then the run of 2021 arrived and I saw the fruits of my due diligence and DCA and saw my portfolio skyrocket.

And more importantly, I saw many new people join the space the same way I did in 2017. Fresh faced and full of hopes and dreams. The same ones who are now deep in the red or barely even in their portfolios. And potentially questioning, was all that ""early stuff"" bullcrap?

Yes, I get it, the higher the market cap, the more it theoretically takes to grow and the less astronomical the bigger caps will grow.
But at the same time I've seen so many new promising projects emerge in the past few years that did amazing things and grew their marketcaps amazingly as well. And I'm sure there will be plenty of those that will succeed in the long run, regardless of how many won't. And all those who took a chance and invested in those made it out big.

My point is, I believe we will *always be early*. It will just eventually shift from the bigger blue chips as they amass more and more in terms of MC. In that sense, I don't have any problem liking it to the regular stock market. You're not ""late"" to the stock market, companies will emerge and technologies will be discovered. And many new opportunities will arise.

So yeah, maybe in a few years, maybe now, we won't be ""early"" for Bitcoin, or even ETH (if early means going 10x in a relatively short amount of time)

But if one adjusts what *early* means and just takes into account that innovation in the crypto imo won't stop, we won't ever have to be ""late"". I've experienced it myself during last run and I'm pretty confident I will next time and the time after next.

In the words of a certain wizard: *we are not late nor are we early, we are here precisely when we mean to be.* (OK that didn't fit 100% but you kno2 what I mean!) :😀",transfermymoons,159,11,0.6

As the banking crisis starts, I am considering investing my money into bitcoin again.

However, I suffered losses in 2021, and I am starting to get afraid of whales and institutions making moves to take our money out again. 

In my mind, here is the scenario that scares me:

They created the bank crisis to push us into all sorts of investments, one of which is crypto. As we don't have trust in banks (which has been brewing for a while and culminating with this crisis), we start investing in bitcoin/crypto. After the coin marketing again reaches out high market cap, the institutions and/or whales play the same game they played in 2021, pulling in and out to take our money out.

68,"[SERIOUS] When will we no longer say ""we are still early""?",11vx2rs,"One of our most common sayings on the sub is ""we are still early"", but when will we actually not be early anymore? Crypto started in 2009, so we are 14 years in, id agree that's still early. So what are the benchmarks that will determine we have become established and no longer early. A short list of where we stand:

\-Currently there are almost 23,000 different crypto's

\-56 different countries have favorable regulations of crypto

\-2 countries have adopted it as legal tender

\-Crypto has become integrated into platforms and technology

\-There are real world uses for blockchain and NFT's

\-Over 1 trillion market cap

&#x200B;

The two key factors we need are awareness and behavioral intent. I believe most people are aware of crypto unless living off grid. So that means we need behavioral intent, which is a willingness to adapt to technology. Some great examples are the internet and smart phones. The internet came around in 1990's and was not well accepted, But by the 2000's it was everything and everywhere. The same can be said for the smart phone. iPhone 1st came out in 2007, and by 2011 everyone had to have a smart phone. Adoption can definitely be quick or painfully slow.

&#x200B;

Now to the question. When will we no longer be considered early? 

\-Regulations established globally that establish trust in crypto?

\-Every country establishes its own stable coin to replace fiat?

\-We have portable crypto wallets that we can instantly transfer between and make purchases with?

Would you be able to pay your bills, or have any emergency funds? What if you immediately needed to liquidate all your crypto?

**Hot wallet and Cold wallet :**

A hot wallet like metamask is convinient and it makes the trading or use of cryptocurrency simple, it is connected to the internet and may be exposed to cyber assaults, which might result in lost fund. You need both the hot wallet for short-term trading and the cold wallet for long-term holding since a cold wallet is often not linked to the internet.

73,The Area Above The Bear: Why I Believe The Cycle Bottom Is In,11vw3v5,"**Intro:**

I haven't seen a technical approach like this one described on this sub before (or on YouTube; no Twitter account), so here goes. If it turns out this is common knowledge and even your grandmother is familiar with this analysis, then go ahead and downvote this post out of sight.

I wondered if the cycle bottom could be identified essentially in real time as it occurs by looking at the cumulative drawdown from the previous all-time high (I like to say PATH) over time, or the total amount of pain the market has felt on the way down.

In this way, a quite severe bear market that plummeted quickly and stayed really low for a relatively short time would inflict a similar amount of pain to a bear market that bled slowly and not so far down, but took forever to do it.

**Method with previous cycles:**

Knowing the tops and bottoms from the bear markets beginning in Nov. 2013 and Dec. 2017, respectively, I added up the percent loss from the PATH for each weekly close from top to bottom. This total has some funky unit like ""percent weeks"" or something like that, but the point is that it's a measure of the accumulated pain since the top.

For example, if the weekly close peaked for the 2013 bull run at $1,205.70 on Nov. 24, 2013, and the weekly close for Dec. 1, 2013 was $697, then for that week we would have (1205.70 - 697.00) / 1205.70 = 0.42, or 42%. For the weekly close that marked the cycle bottom (Jan. 11, 2015 at $199.60), we have (1205.70 - 199.60) / 1205.70 = 0.83, or 83%. The proportion or percent loss is always measured from the PATH, not the previous week. If you add up all those weeks from top to bottom, you get **33.3** (proportions expressed as decimals), or 3330%. That's the Area Above The Bear, the cumulative pain experienced from top to bottom.

[Area Above The Bear = Sum of the bars = 33.3](https://preview.redd.it/b1s47uyq3roa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b119e804a2326e21e27b72de1cc1ad5777b2672f)

For the bear market beginning after the 2017 blow-off, I have a peak weekly close of $19,345.50 on Dec. 10, 2017, and a weekly bottom of $3,228.70 on Dec. 9, 2018. The Area Above The Bear from top to bottom was **30.6**, or 3060 ""percent weeks"".

[Area Above The Bear = Sum of the bars = 30.6](https://preview.redd.it/a6cjk81t3roa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1570bff7751039a412e51712f509dba775d59500)

**This bear market:**

Now to the present bear market, where we don't really know for sure that the bottom has been printed (even if you think you know for sure, in which case I'll trust you, bro).

I have the weekly top at $64,398.60 on Nov. 7, 2021, and a low *so far* of $16,456.50 on Nov. 20, 2022. The Area Above The Bear for that period is **27.3**, or 2730 % weeks of pain.

[Area Above The Bear = Sum of the bars = 27.3](https://preview.redd.it/iv3wt7204roa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89c2e79ba3bdd7ede9bece7052071c1aa83a5c64)

So for the last three bear markets, assuming the bottom for the present one has printed, the Area Above The Bear has been \~ 33, 30, and 27. I think this number shrinking over time makes sense; just as the returns on the way up are diminishing over time, so should the losses on the way down.

|Bear market beginning|Area Above The Bear|Status|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nov. 2013|33.3|Confirmed, historical|
|Dec. 2017|30.6|Confirmed, historical|
|Nov. 2021|27.3|Unconfirmed, present|

As a gut-check, I assumed that the present bear market had not yet bottomed, and continued counting out to the end of February of this year. The Area Above The Bear from Nov. 20, 2022 to Feb. 26, 2023 is 36.8, larger than the known top-to-bottom areas from the prior two bear markets. **That makes it seem likely that the low for this cycle really was in November of 2022.**

**What about closes from other time scales?**

I did a similar analysis with **daily closes**, instead of weekly, and got a very similar answer. The daily Area Above The Bear was a number about 7 times larger than the weekly version for all three cycles. That makes sense, since there are 7 times as many bars.

|Bear Market Beginning|Area Above The Bear, Daily Closes|
|:-|:-|
|Dec. 4, 2013|217.6|
|Dec. 16, 2017|213.4|
|Nov. 8, 2021|193.6|

I'm lazy and haven't done the analysis with **monthly closes**. If someone wants to do that, then feel free. I suspect the numbers are about 1/4 the size as for the weekly analysis.

I think weekly closes are a nice time scale to use. Frankly, you don't need to know the bottom right down to the very day, and the certainty will be less anyway. If you expand out to a month, you could only find out several weeks after the fact that the bottom had hit. That's not the worst thing in the world, but decent-sized swings can occur in the space of two or three weeks.

**Uses and next time around:**

For the next bear market, which will inevitably begin in 2025 (trust me, bro), I expect that the Area Above The Bear will reach \~24 when the bottom is printed.

While this method won't predict when or where the bottom occurs, it will let you know *right after* the bottom has happened (if you trust it). That will allow you to buy in the next bear (or this one) with confidence that the price won't drop below the identified bottom.

I personally don't trust any technical method enough to abandon a DCA strategy for accumulation next time around (after the peak in 2025, trust me). However, I think I will hold a good chunk of powder on the side, and make a relatively large buy when the next Area Above The Bear reaches \~24.

\*\*\*My historical data may not be perfect, since it's hard to get weekly close data from 2013 for free.

If you have higher quality data to work with, then feel free to quibble with my exact numbers and dates. Either way, I don't believe the outcome will change much, and the analysis can still be useful in the future.",MauveTyranosaur69,40,6,0.69

76,I’m a random degen crypto investor like the lot of you who got a taste of financial freedom.,11vvees,"Been in crypto since 2017 and got hooked by the tech (honestly). I knew it was revolutionary back then and not a single hair on my head that thinks otherwise today. Had my fair share of losses, exchanges getting hacked or just ran with all the cash (mf Firano), lost a lot of money in the process but my goal was clear and I suppose after the first bear my crypto-cherry got popped pretty quickly so it felt easy to lose money and deal with the crazy volatility after that. I honestly think that to make money in this game you really need to be a degen because I’m pretty sure “normal” people fold their cards way to fast due to the crazy volatility and 99% scams. As soon as I got passed the $100k unrealized profits with like $20k input my brain wanted to talk rational. Or should I say emotional because that’s what makes people sell. 


Anyhow, I just want to say thank you crypto for making this possible. I know there are more like me and to the people who want to make it you will be surprised where you will be 10 years from now.
I know it’s boasting but we are all anonymous so who cares? I can’t tell my family or friends about it and I don’t know why but I feel the need to tell you what crypto has made possible for me personally. 


You have been warned, it’s utter degen talk down below… :)


So here it goes…


First my goal was $100k, then it became $500k and now I’m aiming for $1mil.
Once I got passed $500k I already witnessed a bear so I knew to take profits, in the last bull run I got lucky with NFT’s and cashed out like $200k to keep in fiat, and wait for the bear to come. I still have like $80k in fiat (DCA’d quite a bit), close to $500k in BTC, ETH and other alts that I think will make it… and maybe XMR.


I guess after all the holding and believing and listening to people crypto has no future I said fuck it, time to realize some gains and give ourselves some nice treats. 


As a real gamer and tech savvy pretty much the first thing I bought once I reached life changing money ($500k milestone) was the best gaming PC possible, and a 4k beamer to stream them. Got some back issues so I bought myself a chair with those cool buttons that make you go “Aaaaaaaah”.
Sound systems in my house, got top tier gaming headsets and the best peripherals to go with gaming PC’s (racing seat and steering wheel, couch co-op keyboards, Hotas flight stick :D). PS5, got it… Switch, got it… Steam deck, fuck it… $4.5k gaming laptop for when I work abroad. IPad pro 3rd gen for banking and easy transport… new phone, new smartwatch for running. GF is into graphic design and was still rocking an old MAC, bought her the biggest one that was available because I love her and I can. 
4k 55 Oled TV screen that’s only as thick as my thumb… Rega Planar 3 record player because the old one was sub par. A freaking whole cabinet FILLED to the ceiling with cardboard games. Another closet with full series of comic strips. 
My garden is finally done, got us some real eyecatchers like the olive trees with the thick stems. Kamado Joe with all the accessoires, boy is that freaking awesome. $25k worth of bikes, indoor, Mountainbike and e-bike. 
Go on holidays, like the 5 star bring me cocktail ones…
My health has improved significantly because I can actually buy the best sportswear now, I feel less stressed because I feel like I’m doing OK and my family will also be fine. Overal happily throwing my money into a black hole again this bear market because holy shit has this been a ride.

If you don't know, this is a message written by Nakamoto himself on the Genesis block of bitcoin, engraved in blockchain 'till the end of time (https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-genesis-block-bitcoin-terms/). Of course, it refers to the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath of a series of bank bailouts that followed.

As the age old saying goes, history doesn't necessarily repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. As of today, UBS has offered to buy Credit Suisse for approximately two billions dollars (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ubs-reportedly-reaches-deal-to-buy-credit-suisse-for-more-than-2-billion-8c9bd4d5). Had this deal not have gone through, the bank would have likely been nationalized. As you know, this is not the only problematic bank in this crisis, since multiple smaller banks have also been royally fucked this time - especially including SVB, the most relevant one for crypto.

People have always suffered, and will continue suffering, from the ""This time is different""-syndrome. Especially in financial crises, when times are good for a long enough time, people manage to forget what has happened before, and believe we have learnt from past mistakes. Thus, they shouldn't be repeated, except that they of course always are (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6372440-this-time-is-different). This is what partly constitutes into crises like these. 

The relevance of all of this for crypto is of course manifest: the original idea, or one of them of Bitcoin was to be your own bank. Even though this poses problems and by no means is a straightforward change, crypto must keep challenging the traditional practices and schemes. This revolution, if you will, is to make the game more fair for the common man, and we must HODL strong in times like these. This time is not different, and without true changes, it will be repeated.",Randomplayeri,28,8,0.67

SBF used crypto for himself (‘evil’)

It was a simple, and some may think ‘dumb’ conclusion. But, it’s powerful, and not said enough! 

I bring this up to people that asks me about crypto, or specifics of what happened with FTX. I never tell them I’m invested in crypto (unless they’re cool). But, whenever people just ask me in general, I shoot them straight.

SBF was not crypto.

Of course that didnt work out, the coins i invested in fell like all the others way below the point were i had put my money into them. I still remember ETH being at 800 $ for a few days, but i didnt had any money READY to buy some at that point.

So my point is simple, if you are like me, just have some money ready at your favourite exchange to put it into a project that you are sure will rise again, of course ETH and BTC come to mind as most likely ones to recover after the price has fallen.

An acquaintance gave me a Discord invitation for a server called ""Elite Pump Group"" and said that you could easily and quickly make a lot of money there. I joined the server and there were a few people chatting and several channels of pics from the past pumps. A guy named Mickey Gold then announces which coin and time as well as a link to an exchange site a few hours before the pump begins. I then observed a pair of these pumps and thought to myself, if that's true, after 4 to 5 such pumps you'll be rich!
That's when I started with respect and the rule: If it sounds too good to be true, it is and won't work. Since you as a beginner also hear that everything is possible with Crypto, I was about to do it. I personally wrote to this Mickey Gold because it meant investing at least 700-800 to ask why so much. He then said something about exchange fees and you can otherwise have problems with the exchange, but 100 to 150 should be worth it.
Since I'm generally skeptical about such things, I started my research. This is how I finally ended up in this community and thanks to you all I was able to expand my knowledge.
Long story short, in the end I noticed that 90 to 95% of the users in this Discord channel were bots, this exchange (luxumbit was the name) site where the alleged pumps were taking place had only been online for 2 months. Finally, I was then told to make a payout at the end you have to make a $400 verification deposit to get your money. At that point at the latest I knew FINGER AWAY and DON'T DEPOSIT MONEY.

88,Awaiting the Third Wave of Cryptocurrency...,11vr747,"Is the Third Wave of Crypto about to dawn?

First Wave - Cryptocurrency is born

The First Wave of BTC was the formulation and development in 2009 but Satoshi and his bros. I don't know if any of you were there then but it seems this was the primordial realm where great gainz were common yet insights and technicality were needed. Just as with placer mining for gold the easy-to-find deposits were just there for the taking. As word of mouth and tech-forum geekery wound down with the rise of social media and mining bountiful Bitcoin become harder, this ended with the coming of the second era in about 2013. So 4 to 5 years have elapsed at this point.

The Second Wave of Bitcoin - Cryptography comes of age

The Second Wave of BTC is what we are still in I would argue. It started when mainstream news began to comment on it, from memory my first recollection was Russia Today's Kaiser Report. The bandwagon was on the move as the curious, the opportunistic and the crazy came along. Yet unlike with Gold Rushes of the past, there was no real mainstream adoption as the technology had not become easy to adopt for the masses. Obtaining a bitcoin required escrowing money and mining it was daunting for the uninitiated.

Slow to get going, but it begins to gather pace. The price is now on the rise and fall similar to a trade-cycle but arguably more erratic and chaotic. With this 'Exploration' comes the slow-hand of regulation yet also adoption in various guises. Honduras and Salvador lead the way. American Cryptocurrency Exchanges become dominant. This age will end I would argue sometime this year, possibly by fall. By now nearly everyone has heard of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, but only a small, growing segment of the population has some. Obstacles such as CEX collapses and scams hamper momentum, but not as critically as first feared.

Ten years have elapsed since 2013 and as mining is now only the realm of the specialized ASIC miner, trade and holding are entrenched. The next and possibly decisive age awaits...

The Third Wave of Bitcoin - Mass Adoption

Over the next 15 - 20 years this is highly likely to gather pace. Generation Zoomer, whilst with less disposable income than Gen. Boomer and perhaps Gen. X, will be the final booster to the Crypto Rocket. Web3 and crypto storage may come into full fruition as a utility but possible difficulties include hyper-inflation and near-prohibition.

Has crypto changed your general outlook to finances, and also life in general?

For me I have seen more value in managing my own security and taking the reasonability into my own hands. Forced by my cold wallet and creating safe backups for those wallets. While there is a load more responsibility I find it comforting that the security is down to me. I have now moved away from cloud storage services in general and onto my own network attached storage. It is more work but having the responsibility mainly lie with myself and the data in my own possession has been oddly rewarding. 

I certainly do not have financial freedom. But I certainly have a heightened interest in my finances.

92,Buying Moons on Sushi Swap with Metamask: how to switch your ETH from the Ethereum Main Network to the Arbitrum Nova Network.,11vqbbo,"Today I successfully bought my first Moons through Sushi Swap. I wanted to do this for months, but after reading most posts on this subreddit there were some pieces of the puzzle missing. I was hesitant. When people talk about Sushi Swap it's easy to forget that Moons are on the Arbitrum Nova Blockchain, and the ETH you want to spend is living on the ETH Mainnet. 

The piece I'm talking about is that only once you connect your wallet (Metamask), you have the option to switch through the available chains in your Metamask wallet. Soon I realized that the ETH showing in the ETH Main Network was 0.00 on the Arbitrum Network. This is where [www.bridge.arbitrum.io](http://bridge.arbitrum.io) comes into play. Go to the site and, connect your wallet. The UI is super straightforward, select from: Mainnet (Layer1)  to: Arbitrum Nova (Layer2). Insert the amount you want to transfer, scroll down and click Move funds to. 

You will have to wait about 15 exciting minutes before the transfer succeeds, so grab a drink and a snack in the meantime. On the bridge website it will update itself and whend completed displays ""succeeded"" on the transaction. 

Now all you need to do is go back to [Sushi Swap](https://www.sushi.com/swap), select the Arbitrum Nova Network again, and Eureka! The default Sushi on the homepage had switched to WBTC, and if you search for MOONS they finally show up in the results. Confirm and exchange your ETH for those divine MOONS.

I'm sure there's more budget friendly options to buy MOONS besides with ETH, but I wanted to try Sushi for a long time. I hope this helps fellow beginners out with what should be a pretty generic operation in the world of crypto. 

In terms of fees I payed about about €3.5 in fees on a €50 Moon purchase, which isn't too bank breaking. 

Because I'm not used to trading, I started out with transferring €11€ worth of ETH (0.007 at the time of writing) to my Metamask wallet, to make sure it worked. I ended up receiving €3.33 in the correct wallet, making it an expensive test. But at least I was confident in transferring the next higher amount. I made sure to save the address of the transaction to avoid mistakes for further transactions. 

For my FOMO Budds: these are expensive times to buy MOONS. In no way I'm advising you to open sushi swap and try it right away. For me €50 Is a significant amount to spend on ""lucrative expenses"" like Moons,  on a monthly perspective. This was personally something I wanted to try for a long time, since the Arbitrum Nova Network. Without [www.bridge.arbitrum.io](http://bridge.io) and it's user friendly UI, this would have been a less smoother experience. 

To end of, Shitposting is still king, and that will be my main income of MOONS.I'm also here for the technology, so being able to do this from my couch was a wholesome experience. It is no very far from other payments systems that we already use. Which makes it even more exciting.",poeselkots,102,23,0.73

Bitcoin has reached new heights in terms of market dominance since June 2022 to reach almost 46% .

BTC's market share has increased after the coin surpassed $27,000 this week, marking its highest level since June. This is a significant increase compared to the two-month low below $20,000 two weeks ago, which was caused by broader risk aversion due to a series of US bank failures, including Silicon Valley and Silvergate, the two largest banks supporting cryptocurrencies and technology.

Although the sudden rise in BTC dominance could suggest a bullish run is underway, many market analysts remain cautious, predicting a slight correction before the final, notable and consistent bull run can begin.

While I get that it's great to finally see some green, I think that everyone should keep in mind that financially, a lot of things are going wrong around the world (banks collapsing, wars etc.)

I've only been loosely following crypto for about a year,  so I could well be completely wrong here, but I highly doubt that a bull run is going to start any time soon so I'm just not going to get my hopes up, and it might be best for everyone to also calm down a bit.

I'll say it again though, I've only been loosely following for a short time, but I've got a feeling some people are getting too excited.

98,Let's not kid ourselves - We are very far from mass adoption,11vpv7b,"Disclaimer: I am super bullish on crypto and I hope it can revolutionize the broken financial system but…

After the events in the past weeks, people in this sub have become extremely bullish again on crypto. Posts are popping up here that discuss that it is  crypto's time to shine in the light of the recent bank crisis and that the recent market pump can be taken as evidence that people are flocking towards crypto because of this. 

Let's be honest though, crypto mass adoption is not happening anytime soon. Here are some reasons: 

* Nations or large institutions have no to reason to adopt crypto - In the end its all about **control** and they are not willing to give that up 

* Fiat rules the world - this is not changing anytime soon -

* Many people investing in crypto do it just because of the money - they couldn't care less about the revolutionary aspects of crypto (anecdotal point from the very few people that I have who actually own some crypto)

* In the public eye, crypto is often still considered a joke or a scam 
* Using crypto is way too complicated for most people 
* Active bitcoin addresses today were only at 1m

* Binance the largest trading platform by far “only” has 120m users

Of course adoption is happening and is only increasing every year. But for **mass** adoption to happen would mean for most people to actually care and for institutions to give up their control.",Killertimme,98,25,0.67

> First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

->We are currently between the *fight you* and the *you win* state.

Crypto's destiny is to be fully adopted everywhere, it is inevitable.

USDC depeg and the closure of *Signature Bank* (<- a bank that were crypto-friendly and fully liquid) were coordinated attacks on crypto.

But instead of causing a global crypto crash, crypto rallied back even stronger!

It is inevitable in a weak fiat-based financial system that crypto will win.

It is inevitable that more and more people will find their way to crypto.

It is inevitable that the value of crypto will rise more and more because the amount of wallets holding it increases, especially *shrimps* (<0.01 coin) and *crabs* (<1 coin). Those people won't sell, they hold it, this helps decentralization).

It is inevitable that mass adoption will come.

100,If it happens are you ready for a bank crisis?,11vpk8e,"Its getting dicey out there. There is a lot going on and a lot to unpack if things go sour. Bank runs are real and if one or two more banks fail we could start seeing a lack of faith in the financial system not seen in a long time.  So my question to this sub is if we are ready for the next financial crisis if it gets here in a week or a month? Are you comfortable that you and your loved ones have enough to survive if jobs are lost by the millions? Will your crypto, guns, food, land, generators and might be enough to get you by until something stabilizes. It just feels like things are going to break and it will be mostly us the little guys that will hurt. Have you saved enough? Do you have enough crypto? Do you believe crypto will be a viable alternative to get you by if your money is not available via your community bank? 

This is a big deal as small companies are already sweating this crisis. Many are deep in debt living of credit and loans plus the amount of debt they have vs unpaid bills, upcoming payroll and open account receivables not getting paid. And here lies one of the biggest problems for small businesses today. The amount of open account receivables not being paid is staggering across the board. Your employer better be on top of who owns them money and better start knocking on some doors because if not many of us will likely be out of a job. 

Remember. This is a game of trust, faith and confidence. Its all an illusion to make us believe this system works and for the most part it has but when it fails us it does so merciless and spares only the big whales. Us little guys absorb all the pain. So i'll ask again. Are you ready for the next bank crisis if indeed it does happen? WIll your crypto have any value or carry you anywhere during such stressful times? It might happen.

101,BTC.D @ 46.96% (Leads before alt season?),11vp4q8,"The Bitcoin dominance is surprisingly high considering the influx of altcoins into the space over the last five years. There has been conversation regarding whether or not the domaince trend would reflect prior cycle patterns. So far, is seems it is and this cycle is not unlike the others.

In the past, Bitcoin leads the market turnaround from bear to bull. A lot of investors assume this and stack Bitcoin in the bear before converting or moving into altcoins that follow soon after. If we are expecting a market turnaround, how long should we expect BTC.D to increase?

I'm planning to see it breach 50% and then I'm going to switch my buys into altcoins. That's probably the best approach I have that considers the domaince metric in market patterns.

102,BTC -> $1M? Beware false prophets & take real profits.,11voye6,"I have lived through the experience where my portfolio gained and lost more than a year's salary in the course of a few hours.  Too many times than is good for my heart.  The adrenaline rush is intense.

One thing I've learned the hard way:  the price of the things currently in your portfolio is largely irrelevant.  What is relevant is the price that you got when you sold, versus the price that you paid when you bought.   

Everything else in between is largely entertainment, .    

There is a lot of fluff being posted that is clearly appealing to base emotions, and a lot of emotional response.   Experience tells me that a froth is coming.  Could be upside froth, could be downside froth.  It's really hard to tell whether the powers behind it are positioning to exit into liquidity, or drawing in more interest to exit later. Could be more than one and could be both... froth is like that.  I am very concerned (given sanctions etc.) that we could have state or state-sponsored actors engaged here.  If that's the case, we're like frogs in a swimming pool with hippos, and that's a recipe to get flattened or sloshed far out onto dry land.  So while I'm with everyone else giddy at the expectation of rising prices, my Spidey sense is tingling. 

In the past, I've set profit targets, extracted profits, and then watched as what would-have-been in my portfolio rocketed up in price, and then rocketed right back down again.  It was hard at the time.  I didn't net as much as I could have, but I did net more than I would have.

With all the ups and downs and the volatility of the crypto market, it's not surprising to have some doubts and concerns.

104,USDC: what if,11vostt,"Now that the USDC pegging/depegging situation has settled down (at least for now, considering that the whole SVB situation is not over yet), I started wondering what would have happened if the coin was not able to go back to the dollar equivalence. 

I believe that, in addition to a general growing distrust towards the traditional banking system, the fact that USDC was able to go back to its 1usd value helped to start the push that we have seen in the last 10 days circa (and which pushed BTC to over 27k). And this is what actually made me ask to myself: ""what would have happened if USDC did not go back to its original value?""

In that case, we would have been in a very strange situation: on one side you have the shitty failing banks, while on the other side a major stablecoin not able to stay stable at all (I know that the trigger was the failing of the bank, but still fear for the market does not put any reasoning in the game). Such conditions would have triggered a major downtrend on both sides, with the risk of a really dangerous domino effect... At least this is my take on the topic.

105,Whelp. A random whale and degen just saved me from a max leverage liquidation,11voruo,"So ummm. We all know the saying: never go max leverage. Now me being me, I decided to do the opposite. It’s also say they say: do the opposite of this sub. This weekend was a real rollercoaster.

I had bought some NEO on Friday at very close to $13 dollars in two trades on max leverage, no biggie,  assuming the price would keeping going up due to bank crash aversion.

Actually, turns out, yes biggie. Very yes biggie! Woe was me when Friday night, prices started dropping. First it dropped to around $12.50. I said okay, I won’t sell. I believe in the trade. Something like that. Believe, conceive, achieve as Luke Rockhold would say. Then the next day on Saturday morning, prices started dropping LIKE A ROCK. See,during the late night/early morning, prices recovered to about $12.66, which was good. But Saturday was brutal. Shiz went from $12.66 all the way down to $11.78. I even got the Margin call email. But I had already gambled all my funds into one position so I had nothing left to put up for margin. But hope was still on the horizon as I wasn’t yet liquidated on any longs or even shorts, even though I still liquidated in my shorts.

My cheeks clapped around of applause at my stupidity the whole day into the night, especially as that night saw many mini-pumps and crashes that actually took the price even lower to $11.64, uncomfortably close to an all out liquidation. It was even harder to bear because I could have just sold at $12.96 or so but I was too greedy. Even when prices were still a ways above $12, I was still in a proper 50% loss. I remember seeing something like a 70% loss at some point, but I closed that screen so quick and told myself it wasn’t real. Did I mention the vast majority of my life savings was on this trade? The ~~hardest~~ most degenerate choices require the strongest wills.

Come to this morning prices were pretty poor still, still being mostly below $12 and me still close to liquidations. What was also playing on my mind was that there is even a liquidation fee, of maybe around 2%, so even if I was liquidated and left with 20%, I would then love 2%\* max leverage of that. But then my hope and belief paid off when suddenly some random degen, pushed the price all the way from seemingly just above $12 all the way to $12.94 baby! Man I, tapped out on that sell button so fast Conor McGregor would be proud. May have sprained a finger but I’ll bandage it with my dollar bill profits. I managed to make a 15% profit after all that. I even made a mistake selling around 10% of the position at 7% below the market price in the hype. All is definitely not well that ends well, I’m super tired and not at all satisfied with how things played out.

I won’t lie, I barely slept this weekend. The stress was wild and I lost several years off my lifespan but I actually made decent profit. Was it worth it? Would I do it again? Well…..",OneThatNoseOne,16,6,0.75
106,"If people ask me how bitcoin works, I have found a lot of success using this explanation. Feel free to use it yourself.",11vobdz,"1. First method is just don't do it. Don't bother. No seriously, Most of the time they don't care. They are just looking for an opportunity to sneer and make fun of you for buying magic beans. Tuipmania, blah blah blah. 
2. But if they actually are interested in how crypto works because they don't get it and want you to explain then this explanation has always worked for me. It's not perfect but it usually makes people understand *why* bitcoin has value without boring technical jargon:

Imagine you are tasked with creating a list. The list has to have some very special properties. Anybody can add to the list. But nobody can rearrange the list or delete an item off of it. It needs to be *decentralized*.

You might think to put the list on a website so that everybody has access to it. It's a good start but whoever owns the server on which the website resides could easily delete the list or alter it so this won't work. That's not decentralized.

So then you might think to distribute that website across millions of different servers with different owners. All the servers talk to each other to update the list when something is added and they all talk to each other to agree what the list is so if anybody tries to delete the list or alter it on their server, the rest of the servers will know and ignore their changes.

Great! problem solved!

But why would anyone be motivated to run one of these servers? What's in it for them? Well, you could pay them but if you ever stopped paying them you could essentially shut down the servers and delete the list. It's still centralized. 

What if the program paid them in its own made up money that it made out of thin air?....

That does solve the centralization problem. But why would anybody want fake money?

Well if there is a market need for a list with these properties and the only way this service can meet that need is if people get paid in the fake money then that fake money necessarily needs to take on value.

Ok, what's the market need? What does this list do that is so valuable?

It keeps track of who has how much of the fake money...

The market need is for a decentralized currency that is fairly distributed and decentralized. Thus the fake money takes on value because there is demand for the special properties associated with it by the list it runs on. The more demand there is for this kind of currency with the inherent properties of the list, the more value it takes on. 

The list is called the block chain and the currency is called bitcoin.

Anyways, that spiel has worked wonders for me. I know there is obviously so much more to say and you will be tempted to add more detail or change the metaphor to be more specific but I promise this method works on normies. Hope it helps someone.",AverageLiberalJoe,127,64,0.79

They say they will add more crypto and BTC LN.

After selecting bitcoin and and continue (Continuar) it shows the amount in bitcoin

&#x200B;

[So that is, 0.00124813 BTC, yesterday it was very volatile so even when BTC was around 27,200 USD using that rate I paid around 34 USD. Not much sense there, 4 USD more I suspect it s a fixed fee, wouldn't make sense be 10&#37;.

After that it shows a QR code, you scan it and have to wait for at least one confirmation after you get one confirmation (mine took several minutes) the cashier press payment received and I suppose it checks one blockchain explorer for one confirmation or pending transaction that matches the amount. If it matches it says payment received and receipt is printed.

I noticed each time you press continuar a new QR code gets generated, so new or different address.

I used Trust Wallet and the fee was 1.36 USD.

Receipt is shown in Bolivares, but that is common here even if you pay with USD, Euros or any currency the invoice will be printed in Bolivares.

Experience was good overall, but in this case I paid a little more, something to improve.

You have to remember that here the economy is destroyed:

&#x200B;

* Monthly inflation can be over 10% easily. Being it under 10% is a success.
* Monthly minimum wage is 130 Bs. (less than 5 USD, this purchase was 5x monthly minimum wage), average monthly wage is 120 USD.
* Since 2007 14 zeroes were removed from the currency, so this 725 Bs would have been 72,500,000,000,000,000

Obviously MOONS  mkt cap is smaller than the market cap of large  cryptos such as BTC and ETH, and I do not see MOONS approaching such mkt  cap values. But compared to other projects, MOONS has significant room  to go up. Especially since meme coins like SHIB and DOGE still have  massive market caps (6.5B & 10B respectively) and shady coins like  LUNC (0.8B) & hacked coins like ONE (0.28B) still hold market caps  10 to 20 times the size of MOONS.

Also  with the recent move of Reddit into the NFT market with its avatars, it  seems Reddit is betting on crypto and potentially will develop further  in this direction. Similarly, we saw GameStop enter the crypto/NFT  market in partnership with Immutable, of which the coins (IMX 1.3B &  LRC 0.47B)  also currently hold a significantly larger mkt cap compared  to MOONS. So if the MOONS ecosystem keeps developing and finds its way  to more applications (e.g. Reddits potential own NFT marketplace), I see  enough room for a further price increase.

114,I think I know how CBDCs will be introduced in the US and possibly other countries,11vmpng,"The primary issue we're facing now is that banks don't have liquidity because many banks messed up big time. Most of the banks have bonds and securities that aren't liquid, i.e., cannot be cashed out without a big loss (exactly why SVB failed). Some have calculated this loss and it's a huge percentage, which is why we're seeing the ""$1M BTC in 90 days"" prediction. It's predicated on the idea that almost everyone is insolvent, and the fed has no choice but to hand them free money, which would cause hyper-inflation.

In the case of a bank-run, most of these banks will fall. In addition to that, the problem is that if you give these bank bail-out money (like we're hearing now), they'll spend it recklessly and repeat the cycle invest without proper risk-management to make yield, like they always did... well, why wouldn't they? They have all the free money they want every time they fail.

But if you think about it, I think a CBDC will be the Fed's go-to solution to this problem. 

People don't do bank-runs to stash the cash under their mattress, but they do it just to guarantee that their cash is available when they need it. Combining this with the fact that the liquidity crisis/bank-runs is a psychological thing, all people need to know is that their deposits are safe. How do you do that without giving the banks any money? You simply tell the bank to screw off, and you tell the people that they can have accounts with the federal reserve that will give them access to their deposits. The bank(s) goes bankrupt, but the people will feel happy, thinking that they didn't really lose their money, which they can immediately use through a central bank.

The validators give back about 85% of their block rewards to their delegators, meaning the required security for the network is around 15%\*42m = 6.3m XTZ, a 7 TIMES REDUCTION!

The idea is to emit the amount of rewards based on the amount staked in the network, hence the proposal called ""adaptive inflation"". It is described here in details [https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/adaptive-inflation/4552](https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/adaptive-inflation/4552), with some additional information here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8\_L\_1rY74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8_L_1rY74)

It should be proposed to the validators in about 6 months (update O?).

The newly created supply side will reduce by a 4-8 factor (hence double or triple halving), and I wonder that will also boost the demand side?

116,PSA: The vast majority of people who have gained financial freedom through cryptocurrency HAVE invested more than they were willing to lose. Please set realistic goals for yourself.,11vlyv9,"Just a heads up to anyone who expects to get rich by investing small amounts of money... Bottom line, it's not realistic. Big reward is almost always tied to big risk.

&#x200B;

And that's not to say investing small isn't a good reason to invest! If you have 20 dollars in your pocket that you'd like to see grow, then in all honesty - crypto is probably the best way to see larger future returns over any other method....

&#x200B;

Hell I got into this game because investing in the stock market was a bit too difficult and overwhelming to get started. Not to mention that in most cases, you need thousands of dollars to open a securities account... With crypto, you don't need to have a large amount of capital to dip your toes, which made it extremely attractive to me.

&#x200B;

That said, make sure that you're not buying into low cap shit coins in the hopes that maybe one day it'll moon-shot to BTC's price... If you do want to set yourself up for a more comfortable future, your best bet is to DCA (Dollar cost average) when you can afford to. Put 50 dollars in here and there, whenever you can afford to invest more. This ensures that you're not reliant on the funds you're investing, while at the same time keeping your risk low, and growing your portfolio in the log term.

To my surprise, after 1 quick google search ( if you count that as research and trust the internet ) that bitcoin uses roughly about .05% of all the worlds energy in a year, compared to all the banking systems we have.

As it stands, it takes 56x more energy to run the banks compared to bitcoin.

So why does everyone always have their pitchfork and torches ready to always complain that bitcoin needs to go green.

There are tons of alternatives to run your bitcoin on a green energy source. The same energy sources we could use to promote our banking industry to also go green.

And we’re not even talking about how many people it takes to commute to work to run the banking system. It takes gas and oil just for a worker to show up to the bank. Every day, back and forth.

How many banking employees are employed throughout the world who drive everyday to work?

But I get hate for plugging in my computer and running a node?

Additionally customer service then let me know that they don't support US citizens anyways.

120,The Bull Trap: How to Spot It and Protect Your Crypto Portfolio 🐂🔥,11vks5h,"Hey guys, it's an exciting time in the crypto market right now with prices soaring to new all-time highs. However, it's important to be aware of the possibility of a bull trap.

A bull trap is when the market appears to be in a strong uptrend, but then suddenly reverses course and begins to decline. This can be devastating for those who were caught off guard and invested heavily during the bull run.

Here are some tips for spotting a bull trap and protecting your crypto portfolio:

1. Don't chase FOMO: When prices are skyrocketing, it's easy to get caught up in the hype and start investing heavily. However, this can be a trap. Instead, focus on the long-term fundamentals of the project and make sure you're investing based on sound principles.
2. Look for signs of a top: Watch for signs that the market may be reaching a top. This could include extreme price volatility, overbought indicators, or a sudden influx of new investors.
3. Take profits: If you've already made significant gains during the bull run, consider taking some profits off the table. This will protect your portfolio in case of a sudden downturn.
4. Diversify: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different projects and asset classes. This will help to minimize your risk and protect your portfolio in case one project performs poorly.
5. Have a plan: Make sure you have a solid investment plan in place and stick to it. Don't make hasty decisions based on emotion or hype.

Remember, the crypto market is inherently volatile and unpredictable.

 Lido Staked ETH (stETH) has surpassed Binance USD (BUSD) in market cap, now valued at over $10 billion, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, BUSD dropped to ninth place with just $8.4 billion in circulation. Lido allows Ethereum holders to stake their ETH in exchange for stETH, a separate derivative token that can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, borrowed, or used as collateral for loans on DeFi protocols. There is currently just 5.6 million ETH ($9.9 billion) staking on the Lido protocol (excluding interest), according to Nansen, a 150% increase from around 2.3 million ETH. ($4.1 billion) a year ago. 

More than 171,000 wallet addresses have stETH. ETH derivatives such as stETH have exploded in popularity in recent months, taking full advantage of the long staking periods associated with participating in the Ethereum 2.0 consensus. Over 17.6 million ETH ($31.3 billion) was staked, representing nearly 15% of the outstanding supply. 

Meanwhile, Ethereum's dominance — which measures how much of the crypto market is ETH — hovers just under 20%, while bitcoin's dominance is nearly 46%.

122,You can store your seed phrase online and be safe if you know what you are doing.,11vkgse,"We keep hearing that you have to always keep your seed phrase offline.

If you know what you are doing you can easily keep your seed phrase online as long as it's not a simple text file or some sort of note-taking app that can be accessed by anyone.

All you have to do is just write that seed phrase in a document, and encrypt the file with a very strong password. Then you can rar it or zip it again protecting it with another password. Just don't make it obvious like your date of birth lol. 

Then Load it up on some sort of cloud storage and you are good to go. Make sure to also have 2FA in your cloud storage account too (not SMS one). Don't name the file anything obvious for the hackers

Now your seed phrase is securely stored online. And before anyone says ""uhh but it's online"" yes, yes it is. But it literally takes hundreds of years to brute force a strong password with a supercomputer. You can store your seed online and have multiple backups even on your phone if you are not a complete idiot.

To get hacked like that hacker needs to:

1. find out what your email is for the cloud storage account, 
2. this means they'll need to target you specifically (highly unlikely, remember that most ""hacks"" aren't hacks, it's usually people willingly entering their seed phrase on fake websites),
3. they will need to find out your password to your online cloud storage,
4. even if you have a virus on your computer and your email and password got keylogger and sent to hackers they still need to go through the following steps,
5. they will need to hack your 2FA (good luck with that),
6. find the file and it will be hard if you have multiple files in there, especially if it's named something like ""holiday\_photos.rar"", don't just write ""MY SEED PHRASE"",
7. they will need to crack the password for the rar or zip archive first,
8. they will then have to crack that file's password which will take years to brute force it (good luck with that)

There are multiple layers of security that need to be compromised. And you'll need to be targeted specifically for that to happen. Even if you have a virus on your computer it doesn't really matter as their vector of attack is completely different, viruses will usually swap your copied address to a hacker's address etc. it's a totally different attack type.

TLDR: You can store your seed phrase online and on devices connected to the internet if you are not a complete donkey. All you have to memorise is your encrypted file's password.",rootpl,129,0,0.39

124,Fire/water and weather resistant ways to keep your seed phrase safe and secure.,11vk29u,"I’ve seen lots of recommendations since being on this thread of how to safely keep your seed phrase, that holds our precious assets safe and accessible at all times.

 I think the best way I can think of is to get a cheap metal engraver from Harbor Frieght, and take small credit card sized pieces of metal you can cut out from a sheet/piece that you can get at a hardware store. Use the engraver and put your seed phrase on multiple metal cards and keep them in multiple safe locations. 

Also wet concrete indoors in an unnoticeable location if you’re pouring a fresh slab in your garage or basement. Find a location on an end that no one would ever think to look, and while the concrete is still not cured, and in between dry and wet and write it in with a fine point object. If it ever flooded or had a fire, in theory you should still be able to access it. And if you ever moved, just take a grinder took with a sandpaper disc and carefully remove the seed phrase from the concrete so the next owner can’t see it.

If you live in an apartment or a city, the metal engraving would probably be the safest bet. It doesn’t really stink or anything when etching metal like it’d be for wood.

Hope this helps, stay safe!

126,Failing banking system and change of habits from their users,11vjjpf,"Here where im living -in Argentina- we had a very big banking crisis in 2001 where banks didnt had the money, a few people rushed and take their money in time and then the vast majority stayed locked outside waiting for a government resolution. After some months the gov resolution came and all the remaining depositors losted 50% or more of their deposits 

After this event, people losted confidence in our banks, they started saving money in their houses with USD cash, sending money to other countries banks, buying property, anything you can think of instead of leaving the money inside our banks. BUT, some small % always remained in local banks because all of us needs to pay expenses, buy groceries, movie tickets, taxes, etc... and credit/debit cards are still very usefull. What we understood is that even big institutions can fail and that the government will help us till certain point, that we need to take precautions by our own hands and diversify elsewhere.

In 2021 several fintech projects linked with crypto debit cards starrted poping up, you can deposit cryptos and use them with your card (Stables or big ones like BTC, ETH, and a few more).

127,Another way of writing down your seed phrases,11vjfo0,"When you create a new wallet, you are always asked to write down your seed phrase. With that experience, when you see somewhere a list of 12 or 24 words, you automatically think this is a seed phrase someone lost or shared by mistake.

Using basic encryption, you can protect your seed phrase from \*\*some\*\* bad actors. Keep in mind that basic encryption doesn't guarantee your seed phrase is safe. However, it may help filter out those who are inexperienced.

The seed phrase is a set of 12 or 24 words from the BIP39 word list. The list is standardized and consists of 2048 unique words, meaning each word has its own index in the list, e.g. abandon = 1, choice = 322, etc. The full word list can be found here: [https://privacypros.io/bip39-word-list/](https://privacypros.io/bip39-word-list/)

If you replace your seed phrases with those numbers, you can introduce a layer of security.

Example seed phrase:

    timber sword where noodle joy eagle admit tuna vibrant museum gossip river

Result:

    1810 1763 2003 1201 965 553 30 1876 1948 1166 808 1495

For the person without experience, it will be quite hard to grasp what that list is and how to use it. This could be improved even further e.g. by merging the list into a huge single number that would make no sense to even more bad actors. However, it would also mean that we would have problems decrypting it because we wouldn't know where the current index ends and the new one starts. As I mentioned above, the list of words is standardized (it won't change), so it is safe to assume that each word from the list is identified by a maximum of 4 digits, and indexes with less digits could be converted to 4 by simply prepending 0 to them. So index 1 becomes 0001, index 64 becomes 0064, and index 986 becomes 0986. Given the same seed phrase, the result would look like this:

    1810 1763 2003 1201 0965 0553 0030 1876 1948 1166 0808 1495

And then you can write down the encrypted phrase as:

    181017632003120109650553003018761948116608081495

If you would like to give it a try, please make sure you can decrypt the phrase before ditching the list of the words you have. Just repeat the instructions in reverse order.

So I'm hoping to get some insight and perhaps even expert guidance from the sub.

Let's say I have a Metamask account, and within that account I have two wallets. One is a normal wallet, while the other wallet is one that's secured by a Ledger. 

For the first wallet, I use it actively to interact with DeFi contracts. I can't keep track on where it's been (and its been to weird places). The second rarely if ever interacts with any contract - its also the one holding a lions share of my NFT assets.

My questions are: 

1. If I signed a malicious contract with the first wallet and it has a command that allows it unrestricted access to that wallet, can it also see and access my other, Ledger secured wallet?

2. How secure is the other wallet secured by my Ledger? So far I've only used it to receive NFTs and signed interactions with OS and Blur (which I've since revoked via revoke.cash) 

3. As far as I can remember, the second wallet is an imported one from my Ledger device (it says Ledger in the list when I click the circle icon top right of MM) so the seed phrase should still be in the Ledger but... any other way  can be sure it's a Ledger account and not a MM wallet ported into the Ledger instead?

Sorry for the long winded questions. I need to make very sure because of all the stories of funds being taken even when the wallet was secured by a Ledger.

Nexo has long been regarded as a rather sketchy lending platform and came under extremely heavy scrutiny at around the time of the Celsius as people were fleeing lending platforms en-masse as trust was shattered and people feared losing their funds

One instance of bad news which I personally didn't believe that Nexo would overcome was a raid on their offices earlier this year. However this seemed to turn out just fine for Nexo (in the short term at least) and in rebuttal, Nexo said that they would be suing the Bulgarian government because of their actions, calling them “shameful” and was preparing to file a lawsuit against the government seeking damages. During this time, Nexo saw a huge wave of withdrawals make their way out of their lending platform yet they weathered the storm and are still here today, seemingly being left rather unscathed by the entire experience.

A second rather large case for Nexo recently has been their battle with the SEC in America. Now, nobody is ever surprised when the SEC stick their nose into crypto and try to shake the foundations but this time they got a bite and Nexo agreed to pay a total of $45 million to US regulators to settle claims that it failed to register the sale of its Earn Interest Product (EIP).

Even though many others on the sub said otherwise, I thought so since no one around spoke of what and where he said until u/angry_koala_26 quoted his $1mn bet terms. 

It so happens that he linked one of his tweets to a longer post which is as follows:

Here are the remaining references, as Twitter has a limit on the number of links in one post.

I am moving $2M into USDC for the bet. I will do it with Medlock and one other person, sufficient to prove the point. See my next tweet. Everyone else should just go buy Bitcoin, as it'll be much cheaper for you than locking one up for 90 days.

Terms of the bet: ideally someone can set up a smart contract where BTC is worth >$1M in 90 days, then I win. If it's worth less than $1M in 90 days, then the counterparty gets the $1M in USD.

HYPERBITCOINIZATION We have to define hyperinflation in BTC vs USD terms because all other fiat currencies can and will be inflated away. That is hyperbitcoinization.

This is the moment that the world redenominates on Bitcoin as digital gold, returning to a model much like before the 20th century. What's going to happen is that individuals, then firms, then large funds will buy Bitcoin. Then sovereigns like El Salvador (@nayibbukele) and tiny crypto friendly countries.

The big move will be when a US state like Florida or Texas, or a ""normal"" country like Estonia, Singapore, Saudi, Hungary, or UAE buys BItcoin. And when @narendramodi tells India's central bank to buy Bitcoin, even as a hedge, it's over.

Why will it be so fast? Well, hyperinflation happens fast. We've seen digital pandemics (COVID), digital riots (BLM), and digital bank runs (SVB). Everything will happen very fast once people check what I'm saying and see that the Federal Reserve has lied about how much money there is in the banks. All dollar holders get destroyed.

The thing is, people are still tuned to an analog world where things get gradually worse rather than all at once. But there isn't much forewarning for a digital event — it's 1 and then it's 0. Just like the bank runs, except this is the central bank.

There are however two sources of forewarning. First is the chart of the long-term depreciation of USD vs BTC, from less than $1 USD per BTC to $25k USD per BTC. Much of the smart money has been voting against the dollar since the financial crisis. The end is a digital drop off a cliff, almost invisible on the chart — but highly visible in the world.

This tweet is the second forewarning. It'll be ignored and mocked by people who still trust the US establishment, even after the last few years. Who can't imagine that the US banks and media could be lying to them to this extent.

But they are. Just as they did in 2008, and over the last ten years. The digital devaluation of the dollar is coming and it's going to be intense.

#ends here, a few of my thoughts hereafter


As much as I have no clue about what btc's monetary valuation would be against usd due to events we've never seen before, I tend to think that his reasoning and references citing them hold valid. I'm surely rooting for the outlook of the current financial and political systems he has as I think of it similarly.

One aspect I tend to differ a bit about is the source of dollar's devaluation. I'm not sure if I differ exactly, since I'm not sure of what he thinks of this issue. It's about the nature of bubbles in general across decades/generations. If we look at the history of bubbles, the only common thing that sparks them is when drastic growth picks up in both the economy and one or more other aspects that tend to dominate most personal and social behavior.

The two most commonly know bubbles from the recent times are the dot com bubble and the housing bubble, both in the US. I don't think many people around the world know or atleast talk about Japan's real estate and stock market bubble of the 1980s. The general opinion both in media and general public is that Japan has a fairly sound monetary system. No one talks about or reacts as much to rate cuts or hike happening there even though it's the world's third largest economy, accounting for almost 8.6% of global GDP. All the messes we know of are from the US which is effectively spreading waves across the world via whatever happens with the dollar like we felt in the global recession. Just the housing bubble there due to a banking and valuation fraud sent the dollar spinning in the air and all nations feeling the effects since they use it as a reserve currency and partially where the own currency derives value from. And as a result, if all of them inflate against each other even in small proportions over long periods of time (decades), we can clearly sense something might go wrong with the notion of money if the US screws up somewhere. Especially in how it's been managing its $.

With the two recent banking collapses in the US, we saw how the government panicked and announced that they effectively fully insure all deposits. But only for these two banks though. It's beyond the mandate of FDIC and the secretary Jannet Yellen stepped in because she sensed ""systemic risk"" to the financial infrastructure of the economy. Econ words for ""oh shit, stop that else the banking sector is gonna trip and fall."" There's a reason they're scared. It's because everything been lent in multiples both to the world (both corporations and foreign governments) and itself. And all that the banks are supposed to keep as reserve are with the FED where they get exchanged for treasuries where the government effectively take that for a fixed period and use it for whatever they wish. One of the things it does with that is lend and fund the functioning of multilateral institutions like the IMF. It pretty much gets that to perform its duty as a government where it's also been using that to exercise power over the world and one of its biggest forms is the military spending. Pretty much what the general international consensus is for what backs the strength of dollar - that it can control and surf through the world events. No wonder they've been involved with every major war of the last century. Anyways, I'm rambling all of this to make the point of credit bubble. That a lot more is being spent that what can be afforded for whatever real value there is to back it - the real economy (!monetary economy). What those US economists won't be allowed to call a disequilibrium.

Everyone would know from econ 101 that wherever there's disequilibrium, the side that's inflated has to revert. It's scary to say it but it literally translates to 'the dollar has to crash to represent what the real American economy can actually afford.' There are many Americans on our sub, it'd be interesting to hear if you can bare the cost of every other diplomatic engagement around the world - military, financial (debt) and health are those big chunks. If the citizens can't, the government's gotta be crazy. It pulls out funds for this both from taxes and as well as fed backdoor. The whole world also takes their word for granted for if they're accounting everything right and not in alignment with their incentives. What could go wrong I guess lol?

If the banks start losing value of the stock market like they already have, people will slowly but surely start pulling out. Would you keep your money in if the bank is losing over 10% its market value in a week? Or even a month? Forget it, even a quarter? It guess that's where time is to tell what's to unfold.

138,Created my own Indicator Set as a means for discipline,11vg38r,"In short:

Due to my lack of discipline and my gambling behavior, I am trying to create my own technical indicators to teach myself to not FOMO but to wait for the right signals. I am quite proud of the outcome and I want to share my positive feeling about it as well as the script itself.

I know it is not perfect and I still tend to overtrade.. but I try to see it as part of the learning curve to understand what strategy works best. And the need to have PATIENCE!

I am now working on a stragety script based on the ""TIRF"" to combine these signals in a meaningful way.

It turned into quite a joyfull hobby, experimenting with pine script. It is much easier then I first thought. I started after watching some interesting guides on youtube how they used ChatGPT to create ""insanly profitable"" strategies, which after backtesting myself is hughly overexagerated... But regardless I tried it myself. And to be honest ChatGPT really sucks in scripting consistently, I only use it as an assistent and actually write most on my own now.

I hope this script may be helpful to others as well. I am always interested to get some feedback on how to improve it. I try to explain the main aspects in the TradingView post as well as comments inside the script.

&#x200B;

Enjoy and have a great run in the future!

141,"SVB collapse is not an I told you so moment for crypto, don’t forget about FTX, Celsius, Gemini Earn, etc…",11veixr,"With the largest bank since 2008 collapsing and needing a bail out a lot of people are praising crypto and dissing the US banking system. But it’s really just not that simple. If you are holding your coins in a wallet, cold storage or not sure your coins can’t be taken. But it can be hacked and stolen or lost with no keys. 

In banking your money is relatively safe but if the bank goes under or you make an incorrect transfer your money is insured and protected.

In the world of exchanges for crypto it was a little of both. People will treat an exchange balance as a wallet and if it’s hacked and it’s a big exchange you should be covered. But FTX and Celsius have showed us this is not an option because people who companies that aren’t regulated can’t be trusted. And neither can banks who constantly gamble your funds.

This shouldn’t be an “I told you so moment” instead we need to look at the pros and cons of both the centralized and decrentralized finance worlds and in the future a new system that works is inevitable.

142,Who here is prepared to hold for decades?,11vef9a,"When I first got into crypto I thought this was whole space was super exciting. Buy things that are super volatile, watch them go up and down, get a dopamine hit reading posts on reddit and dream about what I will do if my holding achieves 10x returns.

The more I learn about this, the more I realize that if the long-term theses of Bitcoin and Etherium will likely take several decades to play out (if they actually do - this is still a risky investment). The majority of people who achieve life-changing wealth will be those who:

* Gradually accumulate blue-chips.
* Prioritize their emergency fund so that if something happens they don't need to sell their crypto.
* Prioritize security (storing assets in cold storage and appropriately managing their seed phrase) and be vigilant of scams so they don't lose their crypto.
* Avoid selling on emotion just because they are deep in the red.
* Continue to hold while the media tells them Bitcoin is dead (again)
* Continue to hold while their family and friends, who they made the mistake of telling, ask them about crypto and laugh at them following a bear market.

We will start families and watch our children grow up. We will move house and have to be careful to not lose our seed phrase. Adoption will take place and Bitcoin will keep ticking while our bodies age and the world changes around us. There will be scams, controversies, and short-lived fads. There may be years on end where the Bitcoin price stays flat or even slowly decreases. For all the highs, there will be a lot of nothing while we gradually DCA in and that hardware wallet sits in the draw untouched. It will be exciting. It will be boring. It will be brutal.

tl;dr: accumulate, don't lose your assets, keep calm and HODL.

Edit: as others have pointed out, don't be afraid to take profits, ideally when the price is relatively high and you can use the funds to impact your life in a positive way.

144,Keeping your crypto secure is nobody's job but yours. Here's how to do it.,11vdyok,"I've seen a few posts recently about people either losing their seed phrase, or an unauthorized user gaining access to their seed phrase. Here is my method for keeping my seed phrase secure:

First, you need a Ledger. If you're not keeping self-custody of your coins, you're missing the point of crypto. Crypto was born out of the distrust of banking and traditional financial systems after the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bailout. If you're letting a bank or exchange have custody of your crypto, you're giving away all of the unique properties of crypto that give it so much potential and value. Get a Ledger.

Next, your ledger will have a 24-word seed phrase. Obviously, this phrase should never be entered into any digital device, period. It should be written down on paper, in pencil (ink from a pen will run if it gets wet).

BUT, what if someone breaks into your house and steals the piece of paper with your seed phrase written on it? What if your house burns down? These concerns (and others) are why you *don't write your entire seed phrase on one piece of paper. You write parts of your seed phrase on three separate pieces of paper.* Here's what you do:

* Paper slip #1 = words 1-16
* Paper slip #2 = words 9-24
* Paper slip #3 = words 1-8 and 17-24

Now, the complete seed phrase is readable with *any two* of these pieces. So for example, if paper #1 burns up in a fire, you can recreate it with the data written on papers #2 and #3. If paper #3 is stolen, the thief only has 16 of your 24 words. They will not be able to gain access to your wallet with only 16 words.

You might ask, ""what if all three pieces are stolen, or burn up in a fire?"" *That's why you keep all three pieces in different locations.* I keep my Paper #1 stored safely on my property. Papers #2 and #3 I've given to two different people whom I trust with my life. They keep the paper I gave to each of them in their own secure locations.

If one of the papers is ever lost or destroyed, I can simply rebuild it using the other two papers. The two people I gave the papers to also know who has the other paper, so even if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, they could get together and recover my crypto, and figure out what to do with it. It wouldn't be lost forever just because I've been smooshed by a bus.

True, the other two people could conspire against me and recreate my seed phrase using the papers I gave them and steal my crypto. *That's why you need to give them to people that you TRUST.* Not only trust in terms that you don't think they would rip you off, but also trustworthy in the sense that you trust them to store your paper responsibly and not lose it.

Before I started investing in crypto, I researched all this stuff. To me, crypto was never going to ""go mainstream"" if a flood, theft, or fire could wipe out someone's entire holdings. I wasn't interested in crypto unless I could solve the problem of redundant and secure self-custody. To me, this ""three-paper strategy"" solves the issue of secure self-custody reliably enough that I'm confident that my crypto is as safe as the fiat in my bank (maybe moreso).

Don't lose your hard-earned money because of lazy security practices. Crypto is for the big kids. There's nobody babysitting your crypto and making sure bad people don't take it. There's nobody keeping track of it to make sure you don't lose it. You need to take responsibility for your own crypto, and the three-paper strategy is a great way to achieve that.",neocamel,80,26,0.7

Before we begin, this is my opinion, thank you for reading, and I’d love to see your opinion. Well let’s begin!

#START

A few weeks ago, busd was in some poopoo and since it’s a stablecoin, the price stays the same. So whether the marketcap is 1 billion or 100 billion, it’s the same/near price. 

Basically around 3-5 billion dollars worth of busd was taken out, and there’s a good chance most people panic sold it and just dumped it into BTC. And went back to sleep, thus the spike in BTC while the busd drama was happening. 

#MIDDLE

Exact thing happened to USDC, it lost a mc of 7.5 billion dollars, (I switched to usd recently, so this number might be a little off). 

Where would that money go to? BTC, and then fomo kicks in, and it goes up. That’s why in 2 days it went up 15-20%.

147,"We may never get ""hyper-inflation"" but we certainly have ""hyper-desperation"" for a bull run, right now!",11vbl4g,"Many of you may have seen Balaji's (ex.

A whole bunch of ""influencers"" and ""whales"" on Twitter are going gaga over that and creating all sorts of theories, touts and perspectives. For example, one said Balaji was right about Covid so he will be right about Bitcoin price signal. 

I see this as a **hyper-desperation among EVERYONE for a bull run**. A VC friend told me that most Venture Capital firms (especially in Silicon valley) are so deeply burnt with 2021-2022 Crypto melt-down that they are desperately want to just exit to market with invested sum, forget returns. Their LPs are behind them and have been hammering for a while. I am not saying we are not desperate, we would like a bull run as much as anyone but it's amusing to see this desperation from folks across the spectrum.

This puts market in a very strange position. There is a little bit of hope for better economic outlook than what most expected towards the end of last year but we are still dealing with the same old issues - war, inflation, FED's tightening, geopolitical tension etc. etc.

So hard to say where we are headed in this extreme desperation even from people who seemed to have some self-esteem, who are now openly shilling. But, somehow, I don't have good feelings, especially for retail investors. It's sad that what Crypto (Bitcoin) was born to fight (a few intermediaries/ centralized figures exploiting the masses) has become an issue for Crypto.

When I mentioned that my funds are currently in crypto, and I could sell them and deposit it in my account, they were stumped on how to document it.   I ended up pulling the funds  out of my 401k loan instead, as it was easier for them to document, and  then I paid off that loan with crypto.

It reminded me of my days in highschool where the teachers didn't like websites to be used for citing a source because there wasn't an MLA format for it.

157,A (hopium-filled) theory.,11v74hm,"So, I've been thinking about crypto a lot recently, and here's what I think.

A lot of the people I know who are very much into crypto have the same story: It's not about the politics or technicality of it: most of them have the same story, they got curious about it a few years back, bought a bit of it, and saw their holdings multiply in value 10x or more. And poof, they were hooked. They're now into it for the long haul.

I think that's at least one mechanism through which (long-term) adoption happens: people get some out of curiosity, or out of necessity (need to buy ""something"" with crypto), the market goes through one of its frequent ""explosive growth"" phases, and that's enough to strongly convince them to use it as a store of wealth.

In the past few years, use of crypto in the ""developing"" world has exploded. People use it to send/receive money from abroad (the market Western Union used to have a near-monopoly on), and they also use it when their country's currency is shit (which is the case in a lot of countries) seeing too much inflation. 

Now, I was thinking: at some point, we're going to go through another of these huge growth phases (People talk about the 2024 BTC halving as the next big one. Even if it's not then, it'll be at some point. Maybe). 

When that happens, a lot of people in the developing world who are holding small sums of crypto, are going to see their holdings explode.

Matias who's working at a hotel in Belgium sends money each month back to his auntie Sofia back in Uruguay. Sofia hasn't spent everything she's got last month, and it starts growing in value, and growing and growing...

I think if this happens to many millions of people around the world, you're going to see many of them starting to accumulate crypto (even if small amounts at a time), in hope that the same thing will happen again. And that could become a new massive motor for the market/for crypto in general.

159,Advantage of holding Bitcoin in time of crisis,11v6l1k,"The global economy is facing a crisis of inflation and other internal financial crisis, such as what we are witnessing right now with recent bad occurrences around the world in Turkey and Syria a lot of people have been mad homeless and government infrastructures such as banks have been destroyed as a result of the earthquake and other natural and man made disasters that has happened in various regions.

This situation has forced many into financial hardship and the unavailability of financial institutions and services, in fact in some countries a lot of financial crisis is currently being experienced.

With most depositors no longer have access to their money through to the high centralization of the financial institutions leaving all the power over their finances in the hand of the central banks.

This crisis has forced many to start looking for an alternative way to save the money, and bitcoin is the best store of value at this point, with Bitcoin, you have total control over your finances and Bitcoin help to reduce the bank to becoming just a Junction or bus stops were our money can just pass through to carry out a transaction or exchange aside from that.

162,Binance's respondes to US regulators... sort of.,11v5ynl," 

Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has recently come under scrutiny from US regulators and politicians. A group of US senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, sent a letter to Binance on March 2nd, requesting financial data and raising concerns about the exchange's activities. The senators claimed that Binance and its American arm attempted to evade US regulators, evade sanctions, and facilitated the laundering of at least $10 billion.

Binance responded to the letter with a 14-page document emphasizing the exchange's compliance efforts and recognizing past mistakes. Binance's chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillman, noted in the letter that the exchange has built solid Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering policies in recent years and leverages both internal tools and tools from established third-party vendors to scan user transactions and profiles in real time. Hillman also stated that between August 2021 and November 2022, Binance stopped over 54,000 transactions as a result of transaction monitoring alerts.

Despite Binance's emphasis on compliance, the exchange's response failed to address the senators' concerns about transparency. The senators had claimed that ""what little information about Binance’s finances is available to the public suggests that the exchange is a hotbed of illegal financial activity.""

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a probe into Binance.US in February regarding trading firms alleged to be connected to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. An investigative report has suggested that Binance was behind a transfer of roughly $400 million in funds from a Binance.US account to a trading firm managed by Zhao. The exchange has also faced regulatory scrutiny in other countries, including the UK and Japan.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are difficult to regulate due to the nature of cryptocurrencies, which are susceptible to being used for illegal activities, such as money laundering. Binance is clearly trying to comply with regulations, but it is operating in a murky and difficult space. The exchange has made mistakes in the past, which is not surprising given the complexity of the regulatory environment it operates in.

The situation with Binance highlights the challenges faced by regulators in the cryptocurrency space. The lack of transparency and anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies make it difficult to track illegal activities. While some countries, such as Japan and the UK, have taken a proactive approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, many others are struggling to keep up with the pace of innovation in the space.

It remains to be seen whether Binance will be able to satisfy the senators' requests or whether they will face further regulatory action. One thing is certain, however, the world of cryptocurrency is never dull, and the challenges faced by regulators in this space are likely to continue for some time.

163,"Deeper Network's crypto miner: a $130 ""free VPN for life"" that requires payment to use",11v5nno,"The Deeper network promises a magical product: For the low price of $130 to [$200](https://www.amazon.com/Deeper-Connect-Pico-Unlimited-Protection/dp/B09TFY1HBZ) or [more](https://www.amazon.com/Deeper-Connect-Mini-Protection-7-25length/dp/B09G27H7HQ), you can get a device that connects you to their network, and it's totally free after that payment. Or so they say. *They* won't charge you, they tell you.

Even better, because the network only uses devices connected in people's homes, this means you can access services like Netflix and Hulu, services that traditionally block commercial VPNs. It's much harder to block a VPN coming from legitimate residential addresses.

Deeper promises you this network of other nodes that will be available to you *for free and forever*, and in exchange for sharing your internet connection, you will get paid. But wait a minute. How will you get paid by other people who are using your node, if they don't have to pay to use it?

## ""Payments of DPR to use""

The Deeper CMO [addresses](https://youtube.com/watch?v=J-aSuNYmTlk&t=5m32s) this:

> So in order to use... **there's very little micro payments**, which is **payments of DPR to use**, but once we're reach a certain amount of nodes, **in order to use DPN you have to have small payments of DPR.** So if for instance Lou I'm using your node and you have bandwidth, you have great bandwidth, you set it at a price, and it's at 1/100th of VPNs cost, I connect to it, **I have to pay you some DPR**, and because you're sharing it with me you *earn* the DPR. **That's the marketplace.**

## ""Stopping users from only using""

Deeper's customer support goes even [deeper into depth](https://deepernetwork.cc/d/842-does-it-cost-dpr-token-to-access-vpn-from-pico-or-mini/2), explaining how users must forfeit some of their cryptocurrency to use it.

>**Once you use 50 MB** of data through a specific node a channel... **reserves 1 DPR** and lasts for 48 hours... This 1 DPR is pledged temporarily with the remaining portion returned to you after 7 days.
>
>...If i connect to 10 nodes and use 50MB's on each of them, **10 DPR would be temporarily locked for 7 days**, after which i would receive back 9.9995 DPR 10...
>
>This system encourages users to offer higher amounts of bandwidth while **stopping users from only using and not sharing**.

## Deeper seems be faking their network

Looking into reviews for the products, you will notice people complaining that IP addresses being used to do not belong to residential nodes. One user complains they connect to [DigitalOcean nodes](https://np.reddit.com/r/DeeperNetwork/comments/ux76i4/not_enough_nodes_too_early_in_the_game/), and [another user](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/review/B09G27H7HQ/R1D1ZKM7HKHQKO/) found their connection being rooted through AWS and Cloudflare nodes. 

This might just be speculation on my part, but if I was a company trying to make it look like my decentralized VPN was better than it really was, I might buy some $5 a month DigitalOcean nodes and set up my VPN on it, maybe grab a few from Amazon too, etc. When the hardware costs $130 minimum, it seems the price is inflated to account for a few months of extra VPN access for the people purchasing it. 

Many other reviews note the absolute garbage service, the lack of IP addresses, the slowness of network connections, etc. The device itself appears to not be made as a VPN at all, but rather a last resort for people who are trying to access blocked content... And if that's the case, trying to access streaming services like Netflix would be absolutely disastrous.

## A closed-source black box

To add insult to injury, the Deeper boxes are running some closed source operating system. Nobody knows what's inside of it, and as long as that is the case, I guess they can keep on pumping out expensive hardware. Their Unbox Therapy promo video contains a comment mentioning their CMO'ss promise to release the source code, but I can't find any video evidence of that ever happening.

# ETA: part 2

## The ""decentralized"" product is centralized

[In a single tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/helloericma/status/1635533786871119873), the CEO/CMO Eric Ma revealed he was able to shut down staking across every Deeper product. 

## It's totally secure... But download the security update

The CEO/CMO of Deeper, Eric Ma, took to Twitter to dispel rumors that the deeper product had been compromised. He [simultaneously](https://twitter.com/helloericma/status/1633352586073100295) insists that there are no security issues, but also promises security updates to prevent future security ~~breaches~~ *confusion* 

>There was recently **a FALSE report** of a security breach of AtomOS. Be assured your data and network is 100% secure...
>
>**We are, however, taking further measures** to further strengthen AtomOS so misunderstandings like this do not occur again.

Upon releasing the security update, [Deeper urged their customers to download and install it as soon as possible](https://twitter.com/deeper_network/status/1636325640629813249). It seems the security issue really was an issue.

## *Nobody* knows WTF is going on

From all the proponents of the deeper software, confusion is the top takeaway I've gotten from them. 

* Sometimes, I am told (by reading official sources) that using the DPN cost money.
* Unofficial sources tell me that the DPN is totally free for life for current users.
* Other people tell me that the official sources are talking about an app that doesn't exist, and that *it* will cost DPN... And that the official sources were talking about the *app* when somebody asked about the device.
* *Other* unofficial sources tell me that the information I have is outdated, but can't point to any updated documentation.

Long story short, the only common thread between all the sources I've seen here is that the official website and the official administrators are not to be trusted. And **for a project with closed source software, not being able to trust anybody is a huge red flag**.",lo________________ol,58,5,0.63

172,Bitcoin as a protection against failing banks? Thoughts?,11v226t,"With recent bank failures causing concern among depositors, many may look to alternative investments such as Bitcoin. But is investing in Bitcoin really a safer alternative than keeping money in the bank? In this post, I would like to explore why investing in Bitcoin may be a safer option for those worried about the security of their money while it sits in a 'safe' bank account.

First and foremost, traditional bank accounts are vulnerable to a range of risks that can lead to insolvency. Banks can fail due to bad loans, market fluctuations, or economic downturns. This can result in significant losses for depositors, particularly those with large sums of money in the bank. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not tied to any financial institution or government. It is a decentralized currency that operates on a global network of computers. This means that it is not subject to the same risks as traditional banks and is not vulnerable to bank failures.

Secondly, investing in Bitcoin may offer greater security than traditional bank accounts. Bitcoin transactions are secured by complex algorithms and cryptography, which makes it difficult for hackers to steal or manipulate the currency. In contrast, traditional bank accounts are vulnerable to cyber attacks and other forms of fraud, which can result in the loss of funds.

Thirdly, Bitcoin offers greater privacy than traditional bank accounts. Traditional banks are required to comply with a range of regulations designed to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities. This means that banks may monitor and report on their customers' financial transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is designed to be anonymous and untraceable. This means that users can conduct transactions without fear of being monitored or tracked. I understand that KYC has its disadvantages due to government regulation (at least in the US), but it is important to realize that the banking system has more information about their clients than a crypto exchange ever would (spending habbit, direct deposits, etc.)

Finally, Bitcoin may offer greater potential for long-term growth than traditional bank accounts. While the value of traditional currencies is subject to inflation and other factors that can erode its value over time, Bitcoin has shown remarkable growth even during bear cycles. While there have been periods of volatility and price drops, the overall trend for Bitcoin has been upward.

However, it is important to note that investing in Bitcoin is not without risk. The value of Bitcoin is subject to market fluctuations and is notoriously volatile. This means that investors must be prepared to weather periods of sharp price drops and uncertainty. Additionally, the regulatory environment surrounding Bitcoin is still uncertain, and there is a risk that governments may take steps to regulate or even ban the use of cryptocurrencies.

In conclusion, investing in Bitcoin may offer a safer alternative to traditional bank accounts in the face of recent bank failures. Bitcoin is not tied to any financial institution and is designed to be resistant to inflation, cyber attacks, and fraud. It also offers greater privacy and potential for long-term growth than traditional bank accounts. However, investing in Bitcoin is not without risk and investors must carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks before making any investment decisions.

Ultimately, the decision to invest in Bitcoin should be based on an individual's risk tolerance and investment goals. Those looking for a safe haven for their money may find Bitcoin to be a more attractive option than traditional bank accounts. But for others, the risks associated with Bitcoin may outweigh the potential benefits. It is important to conduct thorough research and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions.

Edit: A fellow redditor made the comment that I did not completely lead this discussion where I intended it to go. I pretty much think that large institutions can benefit from investing their money in crypto rather than having it in liquid bank accounts where a bank may fail at any moment (the past two weeks have been rough for the financial world and that does not appear to be ending anytime soon).

The host of CNBC’s financial TV show “Mad Money” has given guidance to investors numerous times, but often that advice has turned out to be wrong.

The South African entrepreneur ironically supported the “Inverse Cramer” strategy – a plan that helps investors bet against the stock picks of “Mad Money’s” host. The Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (ticker SJIM) was designed to perform in the opposite direction of the TV personality’s advice. Some cryptocurrency participants have recently claimed that betting against Cramer could be an appropriate investment strategy since his predictions on the future performance of digital currencies, such as bitcoin, have not been quite precise.

Reasons that could explain the rise in Bitcoin include investors realising that it might not be the best idea to park their money in stablecoins - given USDC’s woes - and swapping them for Bitcoin, Binance converting its crypto industry recovery fund from BUSD to Bitcoin, and even traditional markets expecting interest rate hikes to be lower. Of course, no one knows exactly but it’s fun to speculate the likely reasons.

Similarly, do you think Bitcoin’s current pump will be short-lived, as adrenaline-pumping it may be? And that we will witness prices below $20k again sooner rather than later? Or are you of the opinion that it has broken past the resistance level and will henceforth start crabbing at say, $24-25k?",cryotosensei,55,4,0.66
176,The high risks of crypto investments: Tales of fortune and failure,11v1r40,"When it comes to investing in speculative assets which a lot of coins are atm, important to remember that it's not all hookers cocaine and lambos. It's tempting to get caught up in the hype and the potential rewards, it's crucial to approach these investments with caution and do your research. Don't let survivorship bias distort your view of the risks and rewards. Remember that for every investor who makes a fortune, there are many others who lose money or are unable to cash out. Be realistic about the risks and potential downsides before making any investment decisions.

ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings): During the height of the ICO boom in 2017, many new tokens were launched with promises of revolutionary technology and high returns. Some of these projects did indeed succeed and made their early investors significant profits, but many others failed or turned out to be scams. However, because only the successful ICOs are typically reported in the media and discussed in online forums, there is a survivorship bias in the perception of ICOs as a whole.

Altcoins: Similar to ICOs, many altcoins (i.e. alternative cryptocurrencies) are launched with promises of innovation and high returns. However, because Bitcoin and a few other high-profile cryptocurrencies have seen tremendous success, there is a tendency to view altcoins through a survivorship bias lens. This can lead investors to overestimate the potential success of a new altcoin and underestimate the risks.

Hodling: ""Hodling"" is a term used in the crypto community to describe the practice of holding onto a cryptocurrency long-term, even during market downturns. While hodling can be a successful strategy for some investors, there is a survivorship bias in the perception of hodling as a universally profitable approach. This bias overlooks the many investors who have lost money by hodling through prolonged market downturns or investing in a cryptocurrency that ultimately failed.

Overall, it's important to be aware of survivorship bias when investing in crypto or any other asset. Remember to look at the whole picture, including both the successes and the failures, and consider the risks and potential downsides before making any investment decisions.

179,Let’s talk about Plutus,11uznm8,"I have been a user of Plutus. For those of you who don’t know, their main USP is a debit Visa with a cashback function in crypto. It - for me, I’m in the Eurozone - worked like this: I transfer EUR via SEPA, can transfer them onto the card, pay with the card and get cashback in their token, PLU. These tokens are locked for 45 days (I’m not really a fan of this policy, but that alone isn’t that terrible yet), after which I can sell them, on their platform, for EUR to top up my card. So far, so good.

Now, in recent weeks, they started to do improvements on their platform, as they claim. This involved that they suddenly removed the ability to exchange your PLU back for EUR… until July! This is assuming they keep that timeline, which time will tell.

I therefore asked how I am supposed to access my PLU funds in the next three months. They referred me to their option of withdrawal to a wallet, which I honestly cannot tell if it works, because it doesn’t work for me since they impose a 5.63 PLU minimum. This is a cashback platform, many users don’t have that much.

If it worked as they claim, again I can’t try it, it would only work once a week (on Thursday I believe), would cost around 3 EUR in gas fees, after which I would have PLU in a wallet, with follow-up fees to transfer it to a CEX and swap for hard crypto like ETH or BTC or potentially fiat.

I expressed my dissatisfaction with this situation, noting that these kinds of decisions appear like red flags to me, after which mods in their sub started deleting my comments in their official support thread for spreading FUD. All I was asking for was a way for accessing my funds. That’s really poor support, in my view.

I am not saying they are not legit, but practices like this are something that doesn’t increase my confidence. 

Time will tell, but I would urge some caution in doing business with them. We all had experiences with platforms that seemed good and then collapsed, and nobody saw any warning signs.

For me, the warning signs here are them suddenly disabling their main method of selling their token for three full months, only giving the reason they are working on improvements, imposing a minimum amount for withdrawal, and their horrible interaction and censorship of criticism in their official support thread.

181,Exploring the Underlying Values of Blockchain Technology,11uz9qw,"Blockchain technology is often associated with technical and financial innovations, but it also has important implications when it comes to societal and personal values, that are worth exploring. Values, whether they are externally imposed or self imposed, refer to principles or guidelines that help us guide our choices and actions, with the goal of living a meaningful and coherent life. If we hope for blockchain and cryptocurrencies to revolutionize our financial and social systems, we must give more importance to the underlying philosophy of this movement. In this post, we will explore how blockchain technology intersects with the (overlapping) values of trust, authenticity, decentralization, permanence, justice, self-responsibility, and community.

**Trust and Transparency**

Trust is a fundamental value that involves a belief in the reliability, integrity, and honesty of others. Blockchain technology promotes trust by enabling transparent and secure transactions that are verified and validated by a decentralized network of participants. Unlike traditional centralized systems that rely on intermediaries such as banks or governments, blockchain networks are designed to be transparent, decentralized, and trustless. This means that participants can interact directly with each other, without the need for intermediaries, and trust that the transactions are authentic and secure. Besides peer-to-peer financial transactions, blockchain technology can be used to verify the authenticity or ethical status of products, such as organic food or luxury goods, by tracking their origin, production, and distribution through a tamper-proof and transparent ledger **\[1\]**. Blockchain technology can also be used to create digital identities, such as passports or licenses, that are verifiable and secure, without the need for centralized authorities **\[2\]**.

**Authenticity**

Authenticity is another important value related to the functioning of blockchains. Authenticity involves being true to oneself, expressing one's unique identity, and seeking genuine connections with others. Blockchain technology enables authenticity by providing an immutable ledger that ensures the integrity and verifiability of digital assets and transactions. The immutable ledger ensures that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, thus ensuring the authenticity of the data. For example, blockchain technology can be used to create digital art or media that is authenticated and verified, enabling artists to sell and protect their creations in a secure and transparent way (NFTs, Reddit Avatars **\[3\]** etc). Blockchain technology can also be used to create self-sovereign identities, where individuals have control over their own personal data and can share it in a verifiable and secure manner **\[4\]**.

**Decentralization**

Decentralization is a value that involves empowering individuals, promoting self-organization, and respecting individual agency and autonomy. Blockchain technology promotes decentralization by enabling a distributed network of participants to validate and verify transactions, without the need for centralized authorities. This decentralized network ensures that no single entity has control over the network, thus ensuring its resilience and independence. For example, blockchain technology is a foundational aspect of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications **\[5\]** that enable users to interact directly with each other, without the need for banks or other intermediaries. Decentralized networks can also be used to create social networks that are owned and controlled by their users, rather than by centralized corporations, reducing the risk of algorithmic bias and censorship **\[6\]**.

**Permanence**

Permanence involves seeking a sense of continuity, stability, and meaning in life. Blockchain technology aligns with this spiritual value by providing an immutable and permanent record of transactions that cannot be altered or deleted. This ensures that the data recorded on the blockchain is permanent and cannot be lost, modified or erased. Blockchain technology can be used to create permanent and transparent records of land ownership, reducing the risk of disputes and fraud. It can also be used to create permanent records of medical records, enabling patients to control their own data and share it with healthcare providers in a secure and verifiable way **\[7\]**. As we will discuss bellow, permanence, paired with transparency, is a central force in reducing corruption and tracking down criminal activities.

**Justice**

Justice, as we know, involves promoting fairness, equity, and respect for human rights. Blockchain technology promotes justice by enabling transparent and decentralized systems that ensure equal access and opportunity for all participants. Blockchain technology also promotes accountability, by providing an auditable and verifiable record of transactions that can be used to hold individuals and organizations accountable. A potential application of blockchain technology in this direction is in the creation of transparent, pseudonymous and accountable voting systems **\[8\]**, reducing the risk of electoral fraud and ensuring that every vote is counted accurately. The nature of the blockchain favors justice when it comes to crime by providing a clear and permanent ledger on which to track down transactions related to crimes **\[9\]**, whether it be payments, funding, laundering or theft. No one can hide on the blockchain. In a more preventive vision and as discussed in the beginning of this post, blockchain technology can also be used to create decentralized supply chains that ensure fair labor practices and ethical sourcing of materials.

**Self-Responsibility**

Self-responsibility is probably one of the heaviest values related to blockchain technology. Blockchain networks are designed to enable individuals to take control of their own data, assets, and identities. This promotes self-sovereignty, self-determination, and self-responsibility, which are important values for personal growth and spiritual development. By providing individuals with secure and verifiable digital identities, blockchain technology enables them to participate in digital ecosystems without having to rely on centralized authorities or intermediaries. This requires individuals to take responsibility for their own digital footprint, privacy **\[10\]**, and security **\[11\]**. By promoting self-responsibility and permanence of data, blockchain technology can encourage individuals to take ownership of their own lives and become more engaged and proactive members of their communities.

**Community**

Community is another value that is closely tied to blockchain technology. Blockchain networks are designed to be decentralized and open, which enables the creation of new communities and the strengthening of existing ones. Blockchain technology creates new opportunities for people to connect with each other, share their ideas and values, and collaborate on projects that align with their spiritual and social goals. For example, blockchain technology can be used to create community-driven platforms for crowdfunding, where members can support each other's projects and initiatives **\[12\]**, as well as community tokens to reward meaningful contributions to communities **\[13\]**. Blockchain technology can also be used to create decentralized marketplaces that enable small businesses and entrepreneurs to connect with their customers directly, without the need for intermediaries. By promoting community building and collaboration, blockchain technology can contribute to the growth and development of more vibrant and constructive communities **\[14\]**.

**Conclusion**

By promoting trust, authenticity, decentralization, permanence, justice, self-responsibility and community, blockchain technology has the potential to contribute to a more conscious, just, and interconnected society. As we continue to explore the potential of blockchain technology, it is important to remember that its ethical implications are just as important as its technical and financial innovations. By integrating conscious and ethical values into our technological innovations and encouraging open and insightful dialogue, we can create a more balanced and meaningful future for ourselves and for future generations.

\~

**TLDR: Blockchain technology promotes the values of trust, authenticity, decentralization, permanence, justice, self-reasonability, and community; a set of values that can help us move towards a more conscious financial system and world.**

186,[SERIOUS] Do you think the crypto market will keep recovering as it is now? More in description.,11uxqas,"During and after the events related to the Silicon Valley Bank, we've seen the crypto market improve and it's begun to rally in the past few days. The ignition might have been people panic-selling USDC for BTC and ETH, but the growth has been sustained after that.  
I am however worried for the mid-term future:  
\- inflation is still high (both in the US and in the EU) and has kept eaten away at people's purchasing power and savings (I'm talking 10% to 100% increases in the price of all goods, from food to furniture - where I live milk is 30% more expensive than last October, meat is 20% more expensive than 1 year ago, some kinds of home furniture are **60%** more expensive and so on)  
\- despite the above, the rate hikes will seemingly continue for the foreseeable future despite there being no excessive spending to stop; JPow has gleefully commented on how the job market is still ""very tight"", meaning more or less ""we can hike the rates some more, we can afford to have more unemployed people around""  
\- salaries for a lot of professions are NOT keeping up with inflation, and since there already is no overspend to correct with rate hikes I would expect to see even less spending in the future, with people retreating into just spending the bare minimum  
\- the tech sector, which crypto is fairly strongly tied to, has been experiencing regular layoffs since circa the start of the year and it doesn't look like it's stopping anytime soon

With this rather bleak picture as the background, is it really possible for crypto to stay at the current prices, or even recover further?

187,Arguments countering the environmental concerns of Bitcoin,11ux4wh,"I’ve had a few encounters where the environmental concerns of Bitcoin was used as an argument against using Bitcoin and over time I’ve come up with a few counterpoints. Especially now with SVB big in news and some news outlets attempting to use it as a blow against Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency. However, I figured I post my counter arguments in the r/Cryptocurrency hive mind to help improve my arguments for Bitcoin or point out any flaws in my reasonings. 

Some of them are direct responses and some are a bit left-field. 

Direct responses to concerns of Bitcoin using the same amount of energy as entire countries. 

1. The massive energy consumption of the Bitcoin network is by design as a security feature. This means that any rogue entity wishing to hack the Bitcoin network will need to utilise massive energy resources in order to affect the blockchain; this ties in to the security of the network. Other Layer 2 alternatives are much less energy consumptive. 

2. Bitcoin’s energy usage is opportunistic and can in theory be entirely run on renewable energy and is increasingly being done so. It is up to governments to subsidise renewable energy programs and make these cheaper than non-renewable sources.

The following is a bit more left field, and not sure how strong it would make for an argument. 

3. current major fiat currencies also have a carbon footprint associated with them on top of just the equipment needed to run the servers to process transactions, but also in the value major floating currencies have in relation to each other. The value of a major currency against another on a floating foreign exchange market is determined by speculators making bets for or against how well a country is doing economically, usually against the US dollar as the global currency, the value of which is largely tied to oil sales. The economic output of a country itself heavily relies on energy consumption to function. Obviously if Bitcoin was used as a national currency then this argument wouldn’t hold anymore.

* I bought $100 of BTC, and received 0.00468369 BTC, which at the time of purchase, was worth $95.37.  $4.63 of my initial $100, gone.
* When I transferred to my ledger wallet, I paid a fee of .0002 BTC, which at the time was equivalent to $5.48. 
* So I spent $100 to end up with $89.89 of BTC in my Ledger wallet.

Algorand was slightly less terrible, mostly due to (much) cheaper network fees. I spent $100 to add $95.46 worth of ALGO to my Ledger.

So 10.11% of my BTC purchase went to fees, and 4.63% for ALGO. Both of those fees are unacceptable if you ask me.

So needless to say, I did NOT find a cheaper way to buy crypto than CoinBase Advanced Trader. Does anyone have any suggestions for the cheapest way to put BTC and ALGO into my Ledger?

190,"The so-feared and “first-ever“ Death Cross, had exactly no influence on the markets and Bitcoin and that was actually pretty predictable.",11uwu2f,"One very popular Technical Analysis here on this sub is probably the Golden Cross for some reason which is probably a mix of memes and simplicity of it. The Golden Cross basically means that the 50 day Moving Average crosses the 200 day Moving Average, meaning that the short-timeframe upward volatility is over the long-timeframe one and thus its often seen as bullish.

The opposite of that is the Death Cross, which is usually the 200 daily Moving Average crossing the 50 daily Moving Average from the upside. And here already the scrutiny around the latest “first-ever death cross“ hype begins:

Golden Cross and Death Cross are officially just used on the daily charts but the past days some tried to use it on the weekly charts showing that we have a first ever Death Cross there. This is not how it works.

We can also see from this chart that on the first glimpse it seemed like the Death Cross is actually playing out but in reality it was just the early uncertainty around he banking collapse which we all know instead resulted in a rally as of now to even $27k.

This is the trick about TA, sometimes it actually makes sense and many many of the other times we just simply use it in a wrong or “unknown“ way.

You don't only calculate ATH base on the last price but rather the marketcap. One example, a coin that went over hyper inflation during the last bull

GRT ATH: 2.4$

market cap: 2.8B

GRT now: 0.16$

market cap: 1.3B

Some coins have 2.5% other 10% or even 100%, if you compare only the price you are in for a bad time when you realize that that **easy x20 is just a x3**.

ChainGPT caught my attention, being the first advanced AI designed for blockchain and crypto, paving the way for accessible and accurate sources of knowledge and making it easier to navigate Web3.  It's a must-have AI tool with features, solutions, and utilities that include smart contracts development, risk management & AML, chart & technical analysis, advanced AI trading, blockchain & market analytics, code explainer, knowledge & guidance, code auditor, and source of news. There's also a new feature that allows you to ask questions to crypto experts, which should be interesting.

The beta prototype was recently upgraded, so you can explore it if you're interested. 

What are your thoughts on this technology? It has integrated AI and blockchain into a single platform and personally, I think this project is one that will remain relevant in the space because the blockchain industry is still in its early stages, and as technology evolves, the need for advanced AI models that can handle complex tasks and analysis will continue to grow.",Suzxy,17,6,0.88
193,...and now i know why bitcoin maxi's exist.,11uwi6m,"back in 2021 i fell for the hype and bought a bunch of ONE and LRC. of course we all know what happened. LRC turned out to be meh and tanked. i think ive even heard of this one guy who sold his condo to go all in on LRC during its ATH.  REKT.

as for ONE, turns out the guy running it didnt give a shit and prioritized hype and clout chasing over security. and to this day he has claimed no responsibility.

LUNC? a total gamble. but hey, at least i admit it.

LUNA? another shitshow created by the same bullshit artist. 

so i sold all that crap at a loss, tossed it into bitcoin or ethereum, while it was $15k and $800. and kept DCA'ing throughout into those two, mainly bitcoin. just small amounts at a time.

and now, ive made my losses back from the LRC/ONE shitfest, mostly thanks to bitcoin, and also thanks to ETH.

now as you can see, im no maxi since i like those two both. but for guys who only stick to orange, i can now see why.

so instead of shitting on maxis, understand them.",Novel-Counter-8093,90,21,0.66
194,$1 Million In Next 90 Days? Ex-Coinbase CTO Bets His Net Worth,11uwend,"Well here is some grand hopium for y’all.

Balaji S. Srinivasan, former CTO of Coinbase crypto exchange is betting to on Bitcoin (BTC) price to breach $1 million in next 90 days.

Bitcoin News: Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency is riding on massive bullish sentiments amid the ongoing crisis in the global banking sector. Investors are in rejoice as Bitcoin price marked a whopping surge of 35% over the past 7 days. As the Bitcoin price rally continues, the Former Coinbase CTO is expecting Bitcoin to reach $1 million in the next 90 days.

Ex-Coinbase CTO Bets Bitcoin To Reach $1 Mln

Balaji S. Srinivasan, former CTO of Coinbase crypto exchange is betting with “James Medlock” a reported neoliberal over Bitcoin price to breach the enormous $1 million figure. However, Isaac Haxton, American professional poker player decided to jump in to grab the opportunity.

Haxton in a tweet stated that he can send one Bitcoin to escrow on the behalf of James Medlock if he is donating 70% to GiveDirectly. However, the Poker player added that he’ll take all of the downsides if Medlock loses and none of the upsides if he wins.

To this Ex Coinbase CTO reacted that they can do it via smart contract, however, escrow will also work. He mentioned that the rules that the escrow person would need one BTC address and one Ethereum address, while the assets would stay on-chain for 90 days.

Balaji mentioned that if Bitcoin stays less than 1 million in 90 days after the bet, then Haxton will win and get to keep one BTC and $1 million in USDC. However, if Bitcoin price breaches $1 million in 90 days then Ex Coinbase CTO will get both Bitcoin and $1 million USDC.

Bitcoin price is up by over 2% in the last 24 hours. BTC is trading at an average price of $27, 524, at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume is up by 5% to stand at $44.3 billion.",memmox,49,3,0.59
195,Fear and Greed Index?,11uwc9m,"What is fear and greed index even good for? Lots of people seem to live and breathe according to it, always mentioning it whenever there is any movement up or down.

To me it just seems to reflect what people think after something happens, meaning it has no value at all.

Quick look at a date here:

I chose December 29 - 2020 because it was the last time it hit the current values before the bullrun. It was a short time after a pretty quick rise, so what was the Fear and Greed showing? GREED, extreme greed.

29 Dec, 2020 - Fear & Greed at its highest. But did it predict anything of what was to come? Or just state that the price was rising so people ""think"" the price will go down and that's just all there is.

&#x200B;

So, if you do think this index has any value, why? I'm trying to figure this out. Because to me it just looks like if the price was rising in the past few days, it will just be put to greed and if it was going down then fear, that's all. I don't need no index to tell me that.",TheOtherCoolCat,29,3,0.59
196,Crypto Amounts,11uw6lv,"Hello fellow Crypto hodlers. I was talking with some friends the other day about BTC and how much would be a good amount to have before the next big bull run. I thought it would spark an interesting conversation if I asked that question here but on a broader scale. Please let me know what y’all think! 

What would you consider a good amount of crypto, of the more popular projects, to be holding? Or any projects you feel like discussing? 

I listed a few examples below. Obviously owning as much as possible is the goal, but for majority of us having a full Bitcoin just isn’t in the cards anymore. This is not financial advice in anyway, just wanted to spark some conversation.

Sorry for the poor resolution but it says:

\- Are you interested in learning about blockchain, cryptocurrency, security, technology, or following along with tutorials? Binance Academy has all that and more, and also have enough of benefits by investing with a token coin and get %80 of your investment weekly, are you ready?

There are more than enough redflags with this message, but to break it down

\- Typos  
\- Lots of buzzwords  
\- Improper formatting of numbers (%80)  
\- A high promise of return on investment

Be wary of messages, chat requests, etc.  To be safe, just don't respond or simply block.  It's great to learn about crypto, it's great to want to get a strong ROI when investing, but it sucks to be taken advantage of.",TiredRightNowALot,255,81,0.86
198,In 2021 they predicted…,11ufz3e,"A post put out by Cryptoslate in December of 2021 that stated they believed we would have 1 Billion crypto users by 2027

Well..  a year in from those predictions, how are we doing?

According to https://www.zippia.com/advice/cryptocurrency-statistics/

There are approximately 420 million crypto users.  From hodlers, mooners to gamers.  420 million.

This is up from the approximately 300 million users as per the same source in about 15 months, which is about a 33% gain.

Using the 33% in the trailing 15 months, and a straight over year over year 33% growth, we are expected to hit 1 billion users by 2026 which is a year sooner than expected.

This is also not accounting for things like Reddit avatars which will help drive growth to new users.

Another interesting comparison is the internet usage compared to crypto as seen below.

https://cryptoslate.com/internet-vs-crypto-adoption-chart-predicts-1-billion-users-by-2027/?amp=1

If we look here, internet took roughly 35 years from inception to 1 billion, crypto looks to be 12-14 years..

199,Would you rather…Risk vs Reward with a 10 year prediction,11uvww7,"We all know that Bitcoin is king and leads the market. I’ve seen questions here before asking about receiving X amount in BTC vs Y vs Z. How about if you could receive a higher percentage of 1 BTC, but in some projects with a little more risk. Let’s say you could receive any of the following, BUT you had to hold, no selling or swapping, for 10 years. 


A. $27,000 - 1 BTC

B. $30,000 - 16.5 ETH (~10% more) @ $1,800

C. $34,000 - 28,000 MATIC (~25% more) @ $1.20

D. $40,000 - 125,000 MOONs (~50% more) @ $0.32


We’ve seen over the years a lot of projects enter the top 10, only to fall out and some completely die. I’m curious what members of this sub would choose. 

Would you stick with 1 Bitcoin, knowing it’s the safest and still a lot of potential? 

Would you take approximately 10% more in ETH knowing it’s currently #2, but a little more risk?

How about MATIC? Would you take 25% more, but risk it following a similar fate of prior top 10 projects and significantly falling?

Would you be a full degen and take 50% more in MOONs? Will Reddit still be around and prominent in 10 years? The hype is strong with MOONs, but do you have full faith in it? 


Personally, I think I’d go with ETH. I think it has secured its spot as a “safe” project, and will continue to stay in at least the top 4-5.",blackenedavocado,35,3,0.8
200,Now that we are on the upswing I calculated how much a coin would be worth with a 1K investment if it ever reaches back to its all time high.,11uvax1,"Updating this now that we are on an up swing again. The game here is if you believe that a certain project would ever reach is All Time High ( ATH ) again, how much would an 1K investment be if it every did. 

One caveat here is ALGO since the ATH is a bit nebulous due to a spike price about 3 years ago so depending on who you ask the ATH was more recent than that.

201,"Don't go out there hunting for airdrops, you'd be much better getting them spontaneously",11uv7sh,"I have spent a long time during summer 2021 doing various tasks to qualify for different airdrops, and I totally regret it now. Not only did I spend so much time tweeting and liking stuff on Twitter to earn nothing in the end, I actually exposed my wallet to the danger of hacks by interacting with various contracts, especially those from new crypto projects. 

Airdrops are a rabbithole that sucks your soul even more than crypto does. And in the end, it really depends on your luck(some have a secret criteria, and some give airdrops to some lucky participant, etc).

On the other hand, you can make money from airdrops just by being a regular defi user and using new blockchains when they launch. Not only does that allow you to learn more about the project and make better investment decisions, but it allows you to make money from some random airdrop.

Personally, I'm pretty sure I'm illegible for the Arbitrum airdrop, and I didn't really aim for it, instead I became illegible by tipping fellow users here and recieving the monthly airdrops in this sub. Add to that, I used the Arbitrum network to safe-custody my ETH( I can't really afford to use the mainnet, even though it is better for safekeeping).

What about you fellow redditors, do you think crypto airdrops are worth it? And if so, did you make a decent income participating in them?",Sylerb,47,2,0.58
202,If the United States fell into an economic civil war,11uv5b5,"How do you believe it would effect the crypto markets.

I asked our good friend chatgpt and this is the generic response generated.

""An economic civil war between the blue and red states in the USA would have significant repercussions not just for the country, but for the global economy. The crypto market, in particular, would be impacted as investors would become increasingly risk-averse and seek to safeguard their assets. This could lead to a decline in crypto prices as investors move to more traditional safe-haven assets. Additionally, such a conflict would create a highly unstable economic environment that would be difficult for any market to navigate. It's essential to note that such a scenario is unlikely, and the best course of action is for all parties to work towards finding common ground and implementing policies that benefit the country as a whole.""

Hopefully we can do better here to predict the implications.

*Lol, that Balaji post triggered me I gotta say. He went full on CIVIL WAR. But if they just stopped cooperating economically outright, who knows. If some states started dropping the USD because of hyperinflation caused by the fed. Maybe Miamicoin(yes its a scam) was the canary in the coal mine.",Trokariloz,26,0,0.41

204,March Madness of Crypto,11uv0ih,"Like many Americans, I usually watch several games from March Madness every year. For non-Americans, it's a 64-team college basketball tournament that is single elimination. I also typically fill out a bracket of how I think things are going to shake out. This post is just proposing that r/CryptoCurrency hosts a Cryptocurrency March Madness bracket next year. We could fill the spots with the top 64 coins by Market cap and then let users make brackets and track who wins. 

How does it help? I think it will help market and grow the sub. People like these types of competitions overall, which is why we see so many companies marketing around the bracket. Even Starbucks NFT journey this month is modeled around this,. I think it would drive user activity and create a new source of fun in this sub. 

Also, there could be a prize for the winner to motivate more people to sign up and participate...MOONS perhaps?

We obviously are already too late this year, but something to at least start thinking about for 2024.

205,"One of the most positive trends in Crypto: Shrimp, Crab and Fish holders are holding more coins, while more manipulative holders like Whales and Exchanges are holding fewer coins.",11uuyix,"When it comes to Crypto as a market it is often about who drives the prices the most, or in on-chain metrics it would mean who holds the most supply and thus has the most manipulation-power on the markets. It usually was, and is still, very clear who is in that position: Whales and other large holders like mining companies and exchanges.

But this trend seems to be changing over tome, especially this bear market there seems to be a very big shift of power from the bigger holders to the smaller ones, you for the basic understanding here are the definitions of the different holding groups:

* Shrimps, under 1BTC
* Crabs, 1 to 10BTC
* Fish, 50 to 100BTC

\-Sharks,500 to 1k BTC

* Whales, 1k to 5k Bitcoin

(Obviously there are more but those are the important ones for this post)

Here we can see the new Yearly Absorption rates which are calculated by dividing the supply the group holds through the total circulating supply of Bitcoin. We can see how Especially Shrimps and Crabs have been increasing at record pace which is highly unusual for the bear market as the only past increases there have been during bull markets.

And especially the supply on exchanges is on a literal free-fall and nothing seems to stop it as Exchanges for the first time ever were unable to buy during a bear market but instead lost their coins at a record pace.

Also here Whales are having a decrease of supply which is rather in line with the last bear markets and actually even lower this time as even they are holding for the long-term.

This all just shows how the supply is being taken from the “richer“ holding groups and are being transferred to us Shrimps or Crabs. Which will bode very very well for the next bull market as exchanges will be able to use less manipulation on the markets, though they will of course try. Don‘t know about you but I am the most excited to know how this will play out in a bull market…",partymsl,36,14,0.73

210,Taking profits,11uu0pn,"What is your strategy for taking profits? I want to have one before the expected BTC-fueled 2024-2025 bull run.

Looking at past performance, BTC peaked at the following times:

Nov 2021: $69k
Dec 2017: $20k
Nov 2013: $1.2k 

So if I’m making my plan based on timing history says take profits Q4 2025.  If I’m basing it off of price points, here’s what those bull run highs were compared to bear market lows:

2014 low: $111. 2017 high was a 180x gain from that point.
2018 low: $3.1k. 2021 high was a 22x gain from that point.

So if I’m basing it off price from BTC’s $15k 2022 bear market low, the 2025 peak should be between $330k-2.7m.  Now, I don’t think BTC will go that high. I think the most likely case is another lower run, in terms of increase %.  I’d put the range between a 8x-20x gain, which would be 120k-300k.

I know history doesn’t repeat, but I think it’s reasonable that it will rhyme.  I think the best plan is to not take any profits until Q2 2025 at the earliest, and no lower than 120k.

214,Forgotten your vault password? This may help you...,11utmha,"There was a recent post from a user who had forgotten the password to their moon vault and lost their moons in the process. As someone who has experienced this first hand (RIP 10k moons) I shared a quick tip that I wish I'd known before creating a new vault

There are (some pretty specific) requirements when creating your vault password which you may have forgotten. They are as follows:

\-12 characters

\-1 special symbol

\-1 capital letter

\-1 digit

The important thing to note is that **these requirements aren't made clear when trying your password.** You may be inputting your 10 or 11 digit password, not realising it requires an unusually long 12 character minimum. And also a special symbol

So if you're inputting your regular password and it doesn't quite meet the requirements then try chucking a number (maybe 1, or your birthyear) and also a special character (maybe ! or # ) until you pass the 12 character threshold

216,The ultimate buy high sell low strategy guide.,11ut03c,"Do you want to lose money quickly and efficiently in the crypto market? Look no further than the buy high, sell low strategy. This is the perfect way to say goodbye to your hard-earned cash in no time at all.

To begin, start by investing in cryptocurrencies that are already experiencing a surge in value. Don't bother researching the project or the team behind it, just go with whatever is popular and seems to be going up. Once you have bought in, sit back and wait for the prices to skyrocket even further.

Once the prices have peaked, it's time to sell, right? Wrong! Hold on to your investments even as they start to fall. This is the perfect opportunity to lose even more money. Keep telling yourself that the prices will bounce back, even as they continue to plummet.

When the prices hit rock bottom, and you are left with nothing but worthless tokens, that's the perfect time to sell. Congratulations, you have just lost a significant amount of money, and you've done it with remarkable efficiency.

Some may ask, ""What if the cryptocurrency rebounds and goes back up in value?"" Don't worry, the chances of that happening are slim to none. Just accept your losses and move on to the next hot cryptocurrency, ready to repeat the cycle all over again.

217,"From being a doubter, I am starting to believe more and more that the anti-crypto bank-related theories have real merit",11usj77,"The FDIC decided to close Signature Bank because they represent “extraordinary risk”. Signature representatives claim that the FDIC shuttered their door due to a anti-crypto stance. What is at least somewhat interesting is, Barney Frank who sat on their board, is an ex-Congressman, and was one of the two men responsible for overhauling the US banking system post-2008. Frank asserts that regulators targeted the bank to send an “anti-crypto message.” He also spoke about his further post-2008 proposals, as part of the Frank-Dodd act it is inferred, that would have protected more depositors and prevented this situation we find ourselves in today once again, but these proposals did not pass in Congress. The irony is that the exact measures that the Fed, Treasury and FDIC have taken today are exactly what he proposed over a decade ago. I’d think this is the guy to know something about something.

Flash-forward to today, the CEO of JP Morgan had requested a meeting with Fed Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. This meeting occurred where they “brainstormed ideas”, with some input from the FDIC head as well. Can you imagine the heads of the FDIC, Treasury and Federal Reserve responding to a request for and hopping on a call to “brainstorm ideas” with anyone in crypto?  

Now I understand this is a bit unfair. The fiat banking system is indeed critical to the economy, but it understates either enormous power and influence, or some perverse incentive for  regulators. 

What does dig at me though, is the dozens of articles I’ve had to dig through to find that fact reports that JP Morgan, the Fed, Treasury and FDIC did have effectively a closed door meeting, that was all requested by JP Morgan. It just *stinks.*

Now out of their “brainstorming”, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are each depositing $5 billion in First Republic, the banks[ announced in a statement](https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/press-release/2023/bank-of-america-citigroup-jpmorgan-chase-wells-fargo-goldman-sachs-morgan-stanley-bny-mellon-pnc-bank-state-street-truist-and-u-s-bank-to-make-uninsured-deposits-totaling-30-billion-into-first-republic-bank). Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are depositing $2.5 billion each for a total of 30B or so. These deposits are *supposedly* to be treated like regular deposits, but we know that is 99.9% probably not true. Big banks are going to ensure priority on thor deposits.

Then there was the *initial* framing of bank failure as crypto’s fault, until they backpedalled when the public who seem still enraged from 2008, just weren’t buying it. Also, the near-collapse of First Republic and the cracking pressure on other non-crypto-friendly banks was just making it clear that wasn’t true. Besides that, buys in the crypto market are making it clear that media would probably just end up alienating their audience.

And then there’s the fact that the bailed out First Republic was said to be in a very similar situation like Signature Bank if not worse, but Signature was closed and First Republic was rescued. Interesting choice. Of course, there are the allegations that Signature asked Signature to stop crypto activity but frankly that is a fairly weak substantiation.

Now, we are seeing banks borrow record highs of 164B from Fed backstop facilities, which do actually come at some cost, which implies that there are actually a lot of stressed banks, probably somewhere close to the position of where Signature and First Republic were. *Maybe,*  it is just a *coincidence* that Signature was the one that happened to fail first and also happened to be a crypto-friendy bank, even though if it were only given just just one more working day  until Monday thereabout, with all the facilities by the FDIC, Treasury and Fed to sure up banks they would have almost absolutely pulled through. This is assuming they would have even failed without forced closure at all.

And I don’t think I even need to *start* on anything the SEC has done. Meanwhile banks get away with slaps on the wrist from the SEC after their several violations and frauds a year quota, still usually at a profit from the fraud or violation’s returns after losses from the fine.

Regulators aside, U.S. legislators demanded details on American banks’ connections to cryptocurrency in a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell back in December. Democratic senators Tina Smith of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts both specifically mentioned Signature Bank and Silvergate..in their warning about the connections between traditional banks and cryptocurrency. Ironically, it was the same Elizabeth Warren who to repeal 2018 rollback of critical Dodd-Frank protections from 2018. In yet *another* twist of irony, Warren again wrote a letter to seek answers for the Signature Bank collapse, which in reality, was a forced closure rather than a collapse but again the fact that it was a closure rather than a collapse is a key detail being omitted by the majority of news outlets.

On the point of news outlets, I also recently made a [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11tv3l4/moneyand_government_power_talks_forbes_has/)about a very “pro-crypto” and/or pro-decentralization article by Forbes, that also held government at fault for the current banking collapse, and how the Forbes magically backpedalled days later, and change the article to something that remove the blame on government and regulators.

At this point, you’d have to be illogical to at least dismiss the possibility of serious foul play, if not outright manipulation and abuse of power.

218,If you would become finance minister of your (or any) country what would change in crypto related laws?,11usizm,"Let's say you become finance minister of your country and you can make all finance related decisions. As we know in reality finance ministers doesn't make decisions alone and have limited power, but for the sake of this post let's say your power in terms of economy and finance laws related to crypto would be almost unlimited. What laws would you create?

I would reduce crypto tax to 0%  for taking out profit up to $500k yearly, 2% between $500k and $2mln and 5% for anything over $2 mln. State would get their fair share for doing nothing and it wouldn't be anything too much. Ofc profits taken would  only count if you would sell crypto for fiat, no crypto to crypto transactions would count as profit (I look at you US). Also airdrops or NFTs wouldn't count as profit untill sold for fiat either.

I would encourage crypto industry to grow and  people could invest and take profits safely. State doesn't need control or power over crypto, leaving it alone would be enough. I would  also encourage miners to move to my country and try to create pro crypto envirement. I would reduce taxes for miners that use renovable energy and blockchain programming  companies. I would  reduce taxes a bit for people that would like to take up to 10% their salary in BTC. I would also make BTC legal tender in the country with all big and medium businesses  obligated to accept BTC as a form payment. I would leave it optional for small businesses, cause forcing them to accept crypto when they barely survive in modern economy  would be bad. 

I would make crypto division in police to help people against scams, to get their lost money back and to educate. I would put in school curriculum some basic info about  BTC and crypto and open free blockchain courses on all public universities.

I would also give people a choice to save part of their retirement money ( up to 30% in BTC or ETH) in form of crypto. I would also make BTC and ETH long term ""federal"" reserves, maybe something like $20 billion in BTC and $10 billion in ETH. That is not that much money for my country.


I think that would be enough for crypto industry to blossom and my country would become one of crypto paradises. What would you guys change in crypto laws if you could become finance ministers?",Nuewim,35,10,0.75
219,Ditch the CEX: Four Promising Decentralized Exchanges (With pretty UI screenshots),11ushob,"Since the collapse of FTX, I went on a journey to mitigate my risk, and minimize my exposure to centralized entities. I have since proudly achieved full self custody of all my holdings, and do not rely on centralized entities *whatsoever* in my investment/trading approach. 

In my quest, I have also come across some really powerful decentralized exchanges. For most of us who use De-Fi, we know **Uniswap, Pancakeswap**, etc. as the go-to places to swap our tokens. 

However, there has been a lot of innovation in the DEX/DEX aggregator space as of late, and there are now platforms that make trading on a DEX seem like you are still using a sleek and polished centralized application.

Here are four of my favorite decentralized exchanges, to help you all on your journey to self custody. I will disclaim, I do not hold any of the tokens associated with these exchanges, and am not invested in any way - I simply have used the platforms and like what they have to offer.

**GMX (** [**https://gmx.io/#/**](https://gmx.io/#/) **)**

GMX is a decentralized perpetual exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and AVAX with up to 50x leverage directly from their self custodial wallets. It has a total trading volume of $112,878,515,563 at the time of writing. 

The exchange reduces liquidation risks through high-quality price feeds and allows users to save on costs by entering and exiting positions with minimal spread and zero price impact. Users can also open positions through a simple swap interface. GMX is currently available on Arbitrum and Avalanche networks.

GMX is an ecosystem consisting of two tokens: GMX and GLP. GMX is a utility and governance token that accrues 30% of the platform's generated fees, while GLP is a liquidity provider token that accrues 70% of the platform's generated fees. The reported APR for GMX on the site is 11.78% on Arbitrum and 11.08% on Avalanche, while the APR for GLP is reported 51.06% on Arbitrum and 42.25% on Avalanche.

dYdX is a decentralized exchange that specializes in trading perpetual contracts for digital assets. These contracts enable traders to profit from price fluctuations without owning the underlying asset and without the limitations of contract expiration. 

The dYdX protocol is based on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes smart contracts via the Starkware Layer 2 technology known as StarkEx. This allows for swift transaction processing on the platform. However, dYdX aims to decentralize the order book and matching engine fully by transitioning the protocol to its independent Cosmos-based blockchain in the V4 upgrade.

dYdX boasts an advanced, yet user-friendly interface, minimal fees, and efficient transaction processing, as well as the ability to offer up to 20x leverage on positions. 

These features, along with others, have established dYdX as a fast growing decentralized alternative to centralized exchanges (CEXs).

ApolloX positions itself as a pioneering hybrid cryptocurrency exchange that combines the best features of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Its launch in 2021 has empowered users to engage in secure and seamless trading on both the ApolloX Centralized Exchange (CEX) and Decentralized Exchange (DEX) with leverage of up to 150x. The platform offers an extensive range of spot and futures markets, along with a comprehensive suite of trading tools and a robust ecosystem to facilitate broader access to crypto and blockchain technologies. As part of its ongoing development, ApolloX announced in 2022 a token burn program and its transition to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), known as ApolloX 2.0.

221,Another post on how to secure a seed passphrase,11us5zp,"Vitalik's post on multisig wallets and wallets with social recovery has been reposted and looked into __ad nauseam__ now, so I will just assume that whoever reads this has already read it (if not: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11tijiv/how_i_think_about_choosing_guardians_for_multisig). There is, however, a third possibility along with multisig and social recovery, which has the great advantage of being completely chain-agnostic: Shamir's Sharing Secrete Scheme (SSSS). This is nothing new at all, many people will probably have already heard about it (although that probably doesn't mean all of them know exactly how to use it)... This post is for those who don't know and/or have only a vague idea and would like to know more. Even more importantly, this post might be helpful for those who split their passphrase into three, four, pieces hidden at different locations, or are thinking of doing so: SSSS is a mathematically secure way of doing it.

So, what is it? Essentially, SSSS allows one to create N shares from a secret (i.e. a passphrase) such as M shares suffices to reconstruct. N and M can be any, with N equal to or larger than M, clearly. The scheme has the following properties:

- any M shares out of the total N can reconstruct the secret, i.e. you don't need to worry about their order or having a particular share, unlikely the case where you - say - split your passphrase in three word groups A, B and C, where you will have to make sure to have a copy of each and to put them in the right order

- at any time, if you have the secret, you can generate new shares, in case some are lost, bringing the total number from N to N' (M shares will be needed to reconstruct the secret anyway)

- if someone gains M-1 shares, they cannot simply bruteforce the last one, because that will be as expensive as bruteforcing the secret itself

You can use such a setup however you like, either just hiding the shares in secure places you have access to, or distributing them to guardians, or some hybrid setup as well.

Finally, a few words on how to actually do it. I will only discuss what I consider the possibile best way and this will not be an extensive guide, just an outline:

- if you don't have it already, get Tails OS, the amnesiac live Linux distro. Tails is a well-respected privacy-focused Linux distro that can be booted up from a USB drive or a CD and runs directly in the RAM on your computer (i.e. the volatile memory), meaning that whatever you do in it will NOT be written to your hard disk or seen by the OS on it. Caveat: Tails must be installed on the USB drive/CD using a computer that you trust not to be infected, you must boot in it on a computer whose hardware and firmware you trust were not altered maliciously. For more info about Tails, how to install it and use it, see here: https://tails.boum.org/.

- Once you have Tails and you are comfortable enough with it, boot in it __in offline mode__. You don't need any additional software, the utility to use SSSS is already included in Tails.

- Fire up a terminal, then look up this man page to learn how to split a secret into shares and how to recombine: https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssss. Play with it until you're comfortable enough to do it with your actual passphrase. Caveat: The tool works for secrets up to 1024 bits and if you write every word of your passphrase in ful,l you will most likely exceed that limit; however, writing only the first four letters for each word will be sufficient to identify the exact word in the bip-39 wordlist. 

- Make sure you can reconstruct your passphrase using the shares.

- Write your shares down on the medium you prefer (paper, metal, etc.) and secure them (store them in safe locations, distribute them to guardians, hybrid strategy).

222,I am interested in how the community feels about IOTEX,11uqveh," As the title states, I am just interested in how the overall crypto community views IOTEX? I have tried to look into IOT in general and the main two cryptos I have found are IOTA and IOTEX. 

I read some info that said IOTEX is working with the US NAVY but I'm not sure if it's true or not. Or even if it matters. I would think that it shows a great deal of trust and potential for growth if they are indeed partnering with the military. However, I am also aware of the great amount of waste, cronyism, and failed ventures with the military in the past. 

So anyway, how does this crypto look to everyone? Does it have potential? Can it compete with IOTA? Is it a scam? All honest opinions welcome and thanks in advance.

223,Since the bullrun is either upon us or imminent here is an easy to follow 10 point plan for DYOR when evaluating a new project.,11uqsds," 

* **Understand the basics**: Learn the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and their use cases. Familiarize yourself with key terms, concepts, and how the technology works.
* **Project fundamentals**: Research the project's whitepaper, website, and any other relevant documents. Look for: 
   * a. Problem and solution: Understand the problem the project aims to solve and how it proposes to do so. 
   * b. Use case and market potential: Assess the project's target market, use case, and potential for adoption. 
   * c. Tokenomics: Evaluate the project's token distribution, supply, and utility.
* **Team and advisors**: Investigate the project's team members and advisors, their experience, and previous successes. A strong team with relevant experience is essential for a project's success.
* **Community and social media presence**: Check the project's social media channels (Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, etc.) and observe the community's sentiment, engagement, and size. A large and active community can be a sign of strong interest and potential for success.
* **Development activity**: Examine the project's code repository on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. Look for consistent development activity, code quality, and contribution from multiple developers.
* **Partnerships and collaborations**: Assess the project's strategic partnerships and collaborations, as they can be an indicator of potential growth and credibility.
* **Roadmap and progress**: Review the project's roadmap and achievements. Ensure that the team has been meeting deadlines and delivering on promises.
* **Competitors and market analysis:** Analyze the project's competitors and its position in the market. Consider the project's unique selling points and potential challenges.
* **Regulatory environment**: Understand the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the project's target markets. Be aware of potential legal risks and restrictions.
* **Risk management**: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and diversify your portfolio to mitigate risks.

Remember that cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky, and past performance is not a guarantee of future success. Always do your own research, and consider consulting a financial advisor if you need professional guidance.

I'll be expanding on these each in the coming days. Since I'm the dope who lost all his moons I have to shitpost my way back on to the rocket ship. So here is the first of many contributions.

224,Coinbase card,11uqrl5,"Hey everybody.. trying to get a feel on the sub for who uses what and to what degree? Maybe a little discussion on rewards. 

Coinbase obviously offers to US users rewards on purchases made with the Coinbase card. Users load fiat onto the card with a fee > users make everyday purchases with no transaction fees > users earn 1-4% on different cryptocurrencies. 

This months rewards being:
1% on XLM
0.5% on BTC, ETH, MATIC and USDC


Keep in mind that when you load your card with let’s say $50 - you pay a deposit fee of 3% (at time of writing $50 USD is a $1.50 fee) 

Say I spend my $48.50 on groceries- I’ll earn “1%” (.48 cents) in XLM - less than a percent of $50. 

When you load the same card with $1,000- you pay a 2.5% deposit fee.  

Spend $1,000 on gas and groceries- earn 1% (10$) in XLM.

Unless you scale this to a large deposit to get better deposit fees OR get better reward rates (3% and higher) this seems almost negligible or even provides loss for a lot of retail investors. 

Do they ever offer 4% back on BTC or ETH? Or is it always random alt-coins? Which are subject to even greater volatility. 

Understandably this brings use case to cryptocurrency and everyday payments, but some people may use this card at a disadvantage and thought it could be discussed and maybe some people do benefit from it. 

In my opinion retail is NOT depositing their whole paycheck onto the Coinbase card and only investing “little” amounts- $1,000 and less.

For reference, the total amount of users who were taken into account are 11601. As you can see the vast majority has gained much less than 100 Karma points. 

To make this even clearer, I will report the main quartiles and the mean (I'll also put some additional info in brackets, for those of you who are not familiar with quartiles):

\- 1st Quartile: 4 (25% of eligible users gathered 4 or less karma points)

\- 2nd Quartile (Median): 14 (50% of eligible users gathered 14 or less karma points)

\- 3rd Quartile: 53 (75% of eligible users gathered 53 or less karma points)

\- Mean (or average): 116,8

I want to close with a last piece of info, which is what happens if we consider the top 1% karma points earners:

\- 99 percentile: 1848 (meaning that 99% of users gained less than 1848 karma points)

227,Quick summary of the SEC vs XRP lawsuit,11upb0d,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and its co-founder Chris Larsen in December 2020, alleging that they conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP tokens. The SEC claims that XRP is a security and therefore subject to SEC regulations, while Ripple Labs and its executives argue that XRP is a currency like Bitcoin and Ethereum and therefore not subject to securities laws.

The lawsuit has been closely watched by the cryptocurrency industry, as a ruling against Ripple could have far-reaching consequences for other cryptocurrencies. As of March 2023, the lawsuit is still ongoing, with both parties engaged in a discovery process to gather evidence and prepare their cases. In September 2021, the SEC filed a motion seeking to compel Ripple to produce additional documents related to XRP sales, which Ripple has objected to on the grounds of privilege. A hearing on the motion is scheduled for April 2023.

In the meantime, the XRP market has been affected by the lawsuit, with some exchanges delisting or suspending trading of XRP in response to the SEC's allegations. Ripple has also faced legal challenges from XRP holders who claim to have suffered losses as a result of the SEC's actions. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the lawsuit, Ripple has continued to develop its products and services, including its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform, which uses XRP to facilitate cross-border payments.",maurinet79,19,5,0.72
228,Advantages crypto has over today’s banking system,11up4hm,"1. Decentralization: Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized,meaning they are not controlled by a central authority Making them less vulnerable to manipulation and interference.

2. Security: Cryptocurrencies use advanced encryption techniques to secure transactions and keep user information private

3. Faster Transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions can be completed in seconds or minutes, whereas traditional banking transactions can take days or even weeks to complete.

4. Lower Fees: Transactions typically have much lower fees than traditional banking transactions. This is because crypto doesn’t require middle men like banks to process transactions.

5. Accessibility: Anyone with internet connection can use crypto regardless of their location or financial status. This makes them accessible to millions of people who may not have access to traditional banking services.

6. Greater Transparency: Crypto provides a high level of transparency, allowing users to track every transaction and ensure that their funds are being used as intended.

My wife wants me to sell now that I am close to break even (not a chance).  I am a long term investor.  I do see the importance of staying diversified though.  It would have been too hard on me if my entire retirement dropped 70%.

Why?

\- They allege that Ripple company executives illegally sold Ripple to investors without first registering it as a security

Of course Ripple disputes this, they say the token should not be considered an investment contract and is used facilitate cross-border transactions between banks and other financial institutions.

In December of 2022 both sides submitted their final rounds, and the hope is that a judge will rule and avoid trail.

The case could settle as soon as June, but the only ruling Ripple would accept is that it is not a security.

Everyone's favorite SEC man Gary says that he views almost all crypto as a security.(Fuck YOU GARY Fuck You!) He only views Bitcoin as not being a security due to “no group of individuals in the middle,” meaning investors aren’t “betting” on an intermediary.

The SEC basically crushed Ripple from a $120 billion crypto to now a $20 billion. Still in the top coins but not where it once was. Due to its strong following it had continued to succeed but it cant be purchased by US traders until this lawsuit is over.

**Ethereum** - the second most popular cryptocurrency. Decentralized network that allows people to make and execute person to person smart contracts. These contracts allow people to execute transactions between each other.

235,"A hacker returned the ""life savings"" to one of Euler Finance's users",11unya8," A fascinating story happened to one of the users of the recently hacked DeFi protocol, Euler Finance.

He sent a message to the hacker that he had lost all his savings. And the hacker returned the money. In his message to the user, he stated that it was his life savings, which was 78 ETH (130,000 USD), which he had placed in the Euler Finance protocol.

It appears that the hacker took pity on the user and immediately transferred 100 ETH to his wallet. It is not yet known if the user will return the ""surplus"" 22 coins.

In the comments, community members noted that the user did not lose 78 ETH, but 78 wstETH. This token costs 10% more than regular Ether, so the user initially lost not 78, but 85 ETH. However, he still received an additional 15 ETH.

A few days ago, the Euler Finance DeFi protocol was hacked using an flash loan attack. The hacker managed to withdraw various assets worth nearly $200 million.

The creators proposed to the attacker a return of 90% of the stolen funds and keeping 10% for themselves. Otherwise, they promised the hacker ""problems"" with the law and stated that they would compensate anyone who provided information to catch the hacker, up to $1 million.",plug_and_pray,60,15,0.7
236,Crypto did for financial education what school never tried to do,11unohu,"
Tldr: crypto and the bear market are the gateway for financial education, or at least financial curiosity, for the new generation. 

I will speak for my own personal experience but I think some, if not most, will agree. Especially my generation.

I'm 30 years old and I have a decent job. But I NEVER cared or even bothered to improve my financial literacy.

How does the FED work? At what rate are they printing money? What are bonds? How big is public debt? How does inflation work? What's the current rate of inflation? What financial products does the government and banks provide? What's the risk? Etc etc..

Big mistake. Everyone and I mean everyone should know what's going on with monetary policy. It's the policy that most directly impacts your life.

I'm portuguese. And at least in my country they teach 0 about economy and how money works. Let me say that again, they teach 0.

If you never bother to do your own research and get some financial education you will become an adult with no idea how money really works and who controls it.

Now enters crypto. I get skin in the game. While the bull goes on me no care no much.

But a big bear comes along and ""wtf is happening with the world? Why is inflation so high, how much did they print, why are banks collapsing, what does that mean for my crypto and my job/salary?""

I learn about risk. About rate of inflation. About burning. About securities. About reserves. About bonds. About yield. Etc etc..

Although I still feel scared about how much I don't know. At least now I can have an interesting conversation with other people about finance and current events. I can learn more. I know the terms and who runs what.

And this is a snowball of learning. I may never make any profit from crypto, but I will come out of this a more conscious and educated person.",RealVoldemort,169,137,0.79

241,What is the argument for BTC now? Where does its value come from?,11umt4c,"I've been around long enough to have experienced two pro-Bitcoin arguments/justifications. 

Firstly, there was the decentralised currency argument. It was argued that BTC has value as one can transfer value across the world, cheaply, without an intermediary. However, with limited adoption (apart from El Salvador), moderately high fees and slow transactions, this argument has fallen by the way side. 

Replacing the currency argument is that Bitcoin is a Store of Value (SoV). This argument held up very well during Covid, with Bitcoin's incredible price action. However, with higher interest rates and inflation, Bitcoin's price fell through the floor, while more traditional SoVs, like gold, held their price action very well. I've noticed that the SoV argument has become less and less used in day-to-day justifications. 

So, I am genuinely interested in what you believe causes Bitcoin's fundamental value? Is it still the SoV use case? Currency? Something else?",Laughingboy14,74,10,0.66

|Optimism |$998.31m|114|$691.38m|$67.91m|$883.8m|

Arbitrum is currently ranked fourth in TVL between all chains.  You can see the info at DeFi llama here [https://defillama.com/chains](https://defillama.com/chains) 

  

Biggest difference between these chains native tokens appears to be that the ARB token will only be used for governance while OP token can be used to pay for transaction fees although eth is the default on Optimism and Matic is used for all transactions on the polygon network.  

I'm not sure how much this will affect the possible price.

You can see possible prices for the ARB token when compared with other chains marketcap here. [https://imgur.com/a/qObls2T](https://imgur.com/a/qObls2T) this is using only the available token supply at drop of 1.275 billion.

Although the total supply of ARB tokens will be 10 billion the initial supply available for trading will only be 1.275 billion.

243,"Selling Shovels in the Cryptocurrencies Gold Rush - Paid courses are, mostly, scams.",11umfay,"Greetings from Portugal.

During the California Gold Rush of 1849, very few prospectors became wealthy. The majority of individuals who made money back then were those who ""sold shovels"" to the prospectors who led hard lives panning for gold, along with jeans, tents, pickaxes, and other goods and services. 

In contrast, the crypto bitcoin markets are examples of recent gold rushes. But crypto changes a lot, haves lot of different paths and **takes some work to learn the diferent concepts.** **Tools and shortcuts that promisse profits with little work became appetizing.**

With that, there are a lot of people that Sell courses rather than buying Bitcoin. Build a tool to enable users mint NFTs rather than speculating on the cryptocurrency market. Some of them really good. Most of them is not.

And I say most of them are scams because of the simple fact that **nodoby can predict the future and there are too many factors that can change the prices.**

There is excellent free and paid content available. There is dreadful paid and unpaid content available. I've seen several extremely well-done courses that are excellent for beginning investors. A course is likely to be awful if it makes any kind of return on investment.

Given we are now moving back to the war portion of the war-peace geopolitical cycle, using the dollar and the traditional monetary network to sanction enemies is going to become more important. Does Bitcoin weaken the West's position? It's obvious to most people that the West has a growing number of enemies whose values are antithetical to freedom - mainly Russia, China and Iran. Therefore the problem Im outlining is going to become more into focus.

249,What we can learn from Autocracies,11uksvw,"TL:DR at the end

Autocrat leaders and their countries are often under critique from media outside the own country. As we all know, autocrats don’t like being critiqued so they try their best to discredit the information. This is often done by depicting other countries and their news outlets as enemies of the own country. By framing the source of the information as the “opponent”, the autocrat then can discredit the information as an attempt from the enemy to weaken the country, its political structures or whatever. The dangerous thing about this is that once “unfriendly” countries are framed as “the enemy trying to negatively influence us” all information from this source is potentially seen as an attempt to do harm, no matter the subject.

This is a crypto subreddit, why should I care?

Probably you already know where I want to go with this. We need to be cautious not to fall into behaviour as described above. We all want crypto to succeed and in order for that to happen we need to listen to people who criticize crypto. We need to talk about the cons, as well as the pros. Not every critique is FUD and meant to harm the crypto space. Obiously, from time to time there is misinformation. But that does not mean that we should discard all information not praising crypto. We should try our best to be open-minded and this post is my attempt to bring a little bit more open-mindedness and constructive criticism into this sub.

Although we see Bitcoin as a long-term investment and will DCA steadfastly into it, no matter its price action, it’s a nice feeling to watch it pump.

We know that the concept of being a ‘whole coiner’ is just our monkey brain being comfortable with a nice round number. Indeed, integer bias is well documented. Still, the notion of accumulating one whole Bitcoin is an option that people gravitate towards because achieving this milestone will make you one of the exclusive 980k people who have done likewise. To many of us, it means finishing a stacking marathon we have begun years ago. (Of course, the quest to accumulate the second Bitcoin begins soon later.) Fir better or for worse, it is a tangible manifestation of our conviction and commitment.

That kind of behaviour is bad for investor that should use brain to make their decisions. Don't let people talking about bullrun or greed of others dictate what you should do.

- There's always the risk that Reddit might end the project because of their IPO. Actually this could happen for a variety of reasons but the IPO is the most likely one. Or maybe government regulations. Either way, moons would be kill.

- when moons are listed on a major exchange it will be easier to sell them. Everyone expects them to rise but it could could also lead to people dumping their moons and causing the price to drop.

- another risk is that whales might dump their moons. This could cause a significant drop in price and affect the overall market. The distribution of moons is not very fair and there are a few very big players that will be in the territory of life changing gains very soon...

I'm still bullish on moons overall, and absolutely love the project but please let's not get carried away and stay careful. Nothing is guaranteed ever with crypto.

Since the dawn of crypto, there have been two main investment narratives for this novel asset class:
1. Crypto is a high-risk asset that sells off in times of fear in close correlation to speculative tech stocks.
2. Crypto is a safe haven asset that will rise in times of fear because it is not dependent on establishment finance and governments.

We should be careful not to create a false dichotomy as these two narratives likely have always coexisted in influence.  The vast majority of prior evidence suggests that 1 is the far more prevalent narrative, but two days this week show us that people have not given up on 2.  If crypto is going to grow into the digital safe haven that purists have envisioned, now would certainly be a sensible time to do so.  I, for one, will be watching charts very closely next week.

259,Don't rely on revoking tokens. It's too late and will not going to prevent you from being drained by most scams. The best practice is to approve only the amount needed for dApp and use a separate hot wallet.,11uioig,"Revoking is useless against the majority of scams.

**If there were a malicious dApp, you'd be drained immediately after approving unlimited spending before you even had the chance to revoke it.**

Revoking is only good against dApps that started out honestly but later either had a bug exploited or decided to rug pull later on.

And sometimes revoking isn't even easy to do. When Arbitrum One first launched, there was no revoke tool and you had to manually revoke tokens through each token contract's *approve(spender, amount)* function.

**Instead, the best practices are:**

**1) Don't interact with sketchy dApps**: But that's a separate topic.

**2) Approve only the necessary spending limit**: During the approval request, [you can edit the allowance](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6055177143579-How-to-customize-token-approvals-with-a-custom-spend-limit) in your wallet's software client. Once you've finished your swap or trade, the remaining allowance amount will automatic decrease by the amount used and drop to 0.

**3) Use a separate hot wallet**. Keep most of your funds in a cold wallet where they're safe and never interact with dApps.

It doesn't hurt to regularly check for tokens to revoke, but please don't rely on it.

**Hardware devices**: If you have hardware devices to secure both your hot or cold wallets, that's even better protection. But not everyone will need one since it's expensive and not everyone has a large account.

Contrary to common advice, if you only have one hardware wallet, it's better to secure the hot wallet first, not the cold wallet. Cold wallets are already safe from most attacks since they don't interact with anything except for the hot wallet. In fact, delete your cold wallet's software client if you're not using it. You should already have its seed stored elsewhere in multiple locations.",FluffayPenguin,12,3,0.61

In fact, Nov 15th 2021 was the last day the sentiment scored higher that this (72). Not coincidentally, back then BTC was trading near its all-time high. This was at a price of $67,566.83 on Nov 8th 2021.

Another tool often used as an indicator for overall sentiment and trends is the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart. 

The chart was developed as a meme, and has had a recent version upgrade to better ‘fit’ the charts. Nevertheless, also here we can see bullish signals. 

For the first time since Sept 12th 2022 the chart has climbed out of the ‘BUY’ and ‘Basically a Fire Sale’ categories. We have now entered the ‘Accumulate’ territories. To those fighting the FOMO, at this point in time the Rainbow chart indicates the maximum price of BTC in the ‘HODL’ phase at $62,350.58. This would need a 126% price surge, before we would enter the phase named ‘Is this a bubble?’

Their strategy is simple. They hold some value stocks. But split also some money into possible ten bagger stocks. 

I am also invested into stocks. But I don’t think its worth it, to hope for ten bagger stocks.

In my opinion its better to buy value and dividend stocks for the more or less safe haven. But use the planed ten bagger money inside the crypto space.

Every bullrun we see much more than 10x in many coins. Within few weeks people made 20-50x in crypto. But shareholder have to wait many years for their ten bagger moments. Meanwhile they could buy and sell crypto in several cycles…

What do you think is the reason for act like this? For example my friends told me, crypto is still suspicious for them, moreover they are lazy to get more information. But it doesn’t mane sence, they also spend a lot of time to finde possible ten bagger shares…

262,Self-custody Vitalik propose (having guardians and using multisig) is not self-custody. It is basically a bank in all but name.,11uhph1,"When Vitalik advocated for self-custody I was all for it. Decentralisation, responsibility and self-custody over your crypto was one of our main goals. It is important to understand in crypto we and only we are responsible for our money and we should have all control. Only you and no one else can use your crypto. That's can be both advantage and disadvantage, cause it require you to be careful. But it can't be done otherwise, if someone can't take responsibility they should just stick to th banks and leave banks in full control over their own money. But that would be complete oppositiom of all ideals  of crypto.


Now when I hear Vitalik say that by self-custody he mean having guardians over your money and using multisig for your wallets I am confused as hell. Cause it is exact opposite of self-custody, it is centralization with little power over your money. Basically a bank in all but name or at least what teenagers  purchases are ( before age of 18 kids can have a card or make big purchases but parents are guardians and have control including revoking all transactions). It is not any self-custody.

I am fan of Vitalik, but doesn't mean everything he say or do is right. I also had mixed feelings about him trading shitcoins (even if he got them for free probably better was to just ignore them or burn than sell, he doesn't need money) or playing with USDC when it fell to $0.9, especially when so many of people in crypto look up to him as some authority and may try to do the same.  In regard of his opinion of self-custody I think the same and I am concerned why he do something harmful to the space. Did he already forgot the reason why he created Ethereum was centralisation he saw while playing WOW as  teenager?

If you use guardians or multisig to your own wallets you lose control, you can't just send crypto in or out, you need other people's approval. Even if they are your family would you let them control your life? Or maybe better make your guardian some random you don't know, your financial advisor,  guy from bank or your  lawyer... That would backfire easily especially after your death. Your family would tear each other apart fighting for approving  using multisig  to share your crypto. Not first time not last time when familes fight about money. At least when you have full control over your crypto you can give keys after your death to one person  divide it in way you like.

Remember it is not self-custody if you keep money or crypto in bank, exchange or give your keys to anyone else. Self-custody as name suggest is only when 1 person, the owner of crypto have keys and absolute control.",Nuewim,28,0,0.29

 \- BTC will lead as usual

 \- Since margin/futures trading is more widespread now, part of the BTC profits will be used as well as margin on shorting BTC with leverage after the bullrun peak, taking part of the potential inflow of cash getting to altcoins.

 \- Altcoins rally will still be good, but a lot less than if there were no margin or futures trading, mostly since not everybody will get into margin/futures trading and still prefers the normal buy/sell of coins.

Educating our youth about Bitcoin may be a radical move and is probably frowned upon by the mainstream educational authorities, especially since almost all countries in the world are developing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in some way or another. Nonetheless, Mi Primer Bitcoin, a BTC education advocacy, has launched an English diploma program related to Bitcoin in El Salvador. It is projected to reach out to more than 10,000 students - quite an impressive feat.

“Not your keys, not your coins” involves a learning curve that people inducted into the world of Bitcoin must conquer. It is composed of a mindset shift since you must be ready to accept full responsibility of your Bitcoin as no one will come to your rescue when you succumb to hacks and scams. Still, the idea of having full autonomy of your assets is intoxicating. Bitcoin may be the only reliable non-custodial way of managing your finances that is available currently.

The scale varies from 0, which represents extreme fear, to 100, which represents extreme greed. This score is based on several factors, like volatility, market momentum (volume), social media sentiment, Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends. 

Today, this index shows **Greed with a score of 64 out of 100**. This Greed level makes sense as Bitcoin pumped 80% since the bear market low and the entire crypto market rose 59% from the low and people are very optimistic about the market right now.

Hypothetical crap….

What if the government bailed out crytpo firms??   They say they wouldn’t, but what if?

Imagine, a dark(er) day(s), FTX goes down, the gov offers a bailout simply in the name of their citizens and the protection of their hodl’d goodies..  If others go down, more bailouts.. RH, CB, WS, whoever.

Instead of regular repayments, the government then takes it in crypto…. This event coupled with the already hodl’d holdings of bad guy crypto funds, puts the government as one of the largest holders of various coins.

Do they even need to centralize this at that point?  They could in essence act as the largest whale controlling and manipulating the market as they accumulate, confiscate and get repaid for various bailouts…

Could they ever take enough to rock the system or have any sort of control?  Saying this happened, couldn’t they theoretically drag the price down to the point of launching their own digital currency which would then look like a rockstar standout?

271,"Basics of crypto storage, Web3 and security",11uewx9,"As someone who has been in crypto for close to 6 years I see people who are just getting into it making some of the same mistakes over and over. Here are a few things I think everyone should do in their first few months owning crypto

1) learn about and invest in a hard wallet 

2) be overly cautious or even paranoid about signing into your wallet/where you store your seed phrase

3) try and use some of the tech that your investing in 

I’m sure we have all seen the posts that have gone around for as long as crypto has existed that follow the theme of “I lost (a large sum of money) because my wallet was hacked or I gave out my seed phrase” that’s shits scary especially when your balls deep into crypto. 
The best way to avoid situations like that are first investing in a hard wallet also known as a physical place to store your crypto(not online) and make sure your seen phrase is 100% offline. 

After you get your hard wallet your going to set up an online wallet somewhere like MetaMask in order to interact with platforms like sushi swap or coinbase. That online wallet will serve at a sort of passage between your hard wallet (cold storage) and the outside world on the internet. Your hard wallet should never come into contact with anything on the internet besides your own MetaMask. 
This is to prevent people from being able to get into your larger stores of crypto that is kept on the hard wallet. In addition to this when you create a seed phrase for the love of god don’t put it in your notes app or google drive, people can target and hack those platforms and then they have all your crypto. Write it on paper and keep it in a safe place or better yet memorize it. 

When it comes to the first point I made above I think everyone should try to understand and even build something on web3 in order to better comprehend the space that so many of us are dumping our hard earned fiat into.

272,I would like to start a company which stores commodities and tokenizes them. What lengths do you think I will have to go through to convince people its actually not a scam?,11uewtl,"List of commodities that might work:

A. Industrial Metals

1. Copper
2. Zinc
3. Tin
4. Aluminum
5. Nickel

B. Forest Products

1. Hardwood, board feet

C. Other

1. Rubber
2. Amber
3. Oil

I wouldn't do all the above, likely just specialize in one or two. Obviously shelf-life is a concern, so I like industrial metals and rubber. Oil too!

I think an important feature of these types of tokenized commodities is that they are 100% redeemable...in person (what do you think about that? Perhaps an appropriate redemption fee?)

Depending on the commodity type, an ERC20 token or ERC 721, would be appropriate. I like the way PAX Gold does it, as an erc-20 token, but if you want to redeem you need at least 400 PAXG to actually take possession. I think that if you held a tokenized barrel of oil and you wanted to take possession of it, you should be able to do it! Same for a bar of copper.

It's like a threesome payday for me in the next week, with fiat mining payday coming as well. Heck, I might even upgrade my daily instant Ramen to a medium-rare steak for once!

But, there is a bigger point to make here - and it's the potential of how decentralisation and Web 3.0 can reward the ordinary man on the street who participates.

Those who participated in cc/sub, making comments and posts got rewarded with moon distribution. This is arguably Reddit's main way they have gave back to its participants. Imagine if someone like Zucker decided to launch their shitty Libra coin? Think there's any chance of US, the users being rewarded? Nah, it'll just be a cash grab by Zucker.

Second, the Arbitrum drop only happened because THEY also decided to reward the USERS in the ecosystem. Arbitrum also decided to be decentralised, put decision-making in a DAO and the founders renounced control of the token. Look at VC-infested coins like Solana. Did users get anything when they launched - NO, it was the VCs who profited from distribution and dumped on the retail afterwards.

A web 3.0 future, where **USERS** are the ones who get **Rewarded** for their participation, and not greedy corporates or their buddies is the ideal vision for all of us. Kudos to Reddit and Arbitrum for showing the way, and hopefully more will follow suit in the future.",Every_Hunt_160,53,17,0.72

So, no doubt everyone was nervous about the USDC depegging event a week ago. I certainly was.                   

But here's why: I work in the industry and one of the companies I work for has a treasury in USDC. Last weekend I was looking at the charts for a stablecoin that was created by a company that was ""playing by the rules"" and had made no wrong moves.                  

People at the company floated the idea of using other stablecoins, but noted that the situation wouldn't be that much better if we went with tether.                  

But the thing is, I started thinking about, ""Well, what if USDC depegs again, but the depeg is longer-lasting? People will lose confidence in the idea of a properly-collateralized stablecoin.""                

That's why I think bitcoin started pumping this last week. When you trust a stablecoin you're trusting two parties; 1 - the blockchain it's on as well as... 2 - the method it uses to match itself to the USD.               

Maybe my thesis is wrong. We'll find out soon enough.           

#EDIT: I'm dumb. I forgot to substantiate my claim in the OP. Please see below.                

If there is a day when stablecoins see a failure to maintain their 1:1 pegs on the dollar, due to whatever reason, then DeFi protocols are at greater risk of collapse than bitcoin.

What if we see something like the SVB situation on a larger scale?""

* **Racing**: Race against other players on a dangerous camp and get to the finish line first.
* **Vibe Collection**: Collect the most vibe objects on the map faster than everyone else.
* **Shooting**: Shoot other players and KO more than everyone else.

Every mode has many different maps. Some are dev-created, and some are user-created, so there's a huge variety.

## The Characters - Blankos

[Right Blanko is the free one every gets at the start. Left Blanko is a free giveaway from the marketplace.](https://preview.redd.it/ne3f12u06eoa1.jpg?width=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c551573948c781d01ab4ff5be73aa0d300f4355d)

You start out with a newbie Blanko. Each Blanko has its own special properties, moves, and abilities. The vast majority of the paid ones are about $5-10 and are minted through the Mystical marketplace store. The most expensive ones can be hundreds of dollars. You earn \~10 Blanko Bucks per game you play, which takes about 10-20 minutes to finish. You need about 1000 BBs for the cheaper paid Blankos, so it takes 100 games to get there. It's totally not worth your time unless you love the game.

Each Blanko can be leveled up and given perks (like Call of Duty) for additional special abilities like flying higher, spinning longer, recharging faster, or having a shield.

## The 4 Modes

There are a lot of veteran players here with high-leveled Blankos and special abilities. They will dominate your free Blanko, so don't expect to win your first several matches.

It takes about 3-5 minutes to match with other players in a Brawl, which is a set of 3 games with randomized modes and maps. Some maps are poorly designed while others are amazing.

**Racing**

This is like those Mario 64 / Mario Galaxy racing games where there's a bit of platforming. Every map is different. This is my favorite mode.

[Racing - Like Mario Kart, but worse and with platforming](https://preview.redd.it/osm7wlo56eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc3441a2a927047d9fa4786ee3e80a459c1bd817)

**Vibe Collection**

You're put into a room with lots of vibe objects. Collect them faster than everyone else. Some of the better maps require a bit of difficult platforming, but most are bland. This is my least favorite mode.

[Vibe Collection - Get as many lightning objects in the limited time](https://preview.redd.it/w226h1oa6eoa1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9f4216e39fcbcb13543cf5626ad00c20fc410e9e)

**Shooting**

It's a standard Death Match. Collect guns and ammo in a room, and KO more people than everyone else. There are only 3 main types of runs (handgun, semi-automatic, and rocket launcher). This mode is broken. People were killing me in 3 seconds while I could shoot them for 10 seconds in a row while not doing any damage. I later found out that there is considerable lag and the players were abusing this by constantly jumping up and down, which somehow ruins the hitbox.

**Junction**

I'm not exactly sure what this is. It's an open-plaza of many locations. I think it was intended as a meeting place for people to hang out when not playing. However, it's empty like most of Decentraland. It would be really cool if they added gameplay modes here, but there's currently nothing to do here except explore by yourself.

## The Blockchain Element

This is one of those traditional games that doesn't need a blockchain. You wouldn't even notice if they replaced the blockchain with a traditional database.

All sales are done in fiat. You can't connect your wallet to the blockchain or marketplace.

The Blankos and player items are minted on the completely-private Mythical blockchain. This blockchain is only used for the 2 Mythical games: Blankos and Rivals (an NFL fantasy-league-like collection game). It's so private there isn't even a blockchain explorer.

The only connection to a public blockchain is through the Ethereum bridge. You can bridge your Blankos to the Ethereum mainnet using Mythical's website, and then sell them as NFTs on OpenSea.

## My Ratings

**Gameplay**: 3/5 - There are plenty of more-enjoyable traditional multiplayer games. There's nothing special about Blankos.

**Blockchain**: 1/5 - Barely uses the blockchain and would do just fine without one.

When I was younger, I used to play games so much I probably went 2 full decades where I completed a new game every week. Nowadays, I don't have that much time, so if a game doesn't interest me after a day, I just drop it. Blankos Block Party is one of those games I drop. It barely qualifies as a blockchain game, so I wasn't curious enough to stick around.

Blankos is more fun than many other crypto games I've played, but that's an awfully-low standard. It's like playing Mario Party, but sober and with random strangers. The only reason Mario Party and Wii Sports were fun for me when I younger is because I played with my roommates, and they were stupid fun when we were all drunk.

283,The Reddit app is suggesting to back up your vault via cloud using Google drive. I highly suggest you do not do this.,11ua50d,"Since the introduction of Reddit vaults, each Reddit user in this sub has the ability to open up their own decentralized wallet called a Vault and collect community points on the blockchain such as Moons or Bricks via upvotes every month.   
Since this wallet is self managed it is truly your keys your crypto and you're responsibility to keep your own seedphrase backed up and secured.   
The best way to back up and secure your seed phrase is to write it down on paper and store in a safe location, although some may find the 2 minutes of work a little annoying and some users don't do this at all.   
Reddit has an option of backing up your seedphrase on the cloud via Google drive, ironically metamask mobile and coinbase wallet also has a similar option of backing up your seedphrase via Google drive or icloud.   
Seedphrase backup via cloud is one of the worst ways to store your private keys, since it's on the internet this allows a path for hackers or scammers to gain access to your seedphrase.   
People trying to steal your crypto are relentless these days and spend a lot of time and energy into trying to steal your funds via phishing, social engineering, sim swapping, scrapping data breach lists on the darkweb, some groups have turned this into a full time business, hell even North Korea does it.   
It won't happen to you? We recently had someone in this sub lose 300k of crypto because they had their seedphrases on their Evernote cloud account.   
If you carry a substantial sum of Moons or crypto please backup your seedphrase on paper and no where near the internet.

285,"I have developed a new validation protocol, PON",11u9o7s,"Proof-of-Nudes (PoN) protocols are a class of consensus mechanisms for blockchains that work by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of nudes in the associated cryptocurrency. This is done to avoid the computational cost of proof-of-work schemes.

Proof of Nudes uses a manual validation of nudes to verify transactions, requiring a potential attacker to view more nudes than humanely possible. This incentivizes validators to view as many nudes as they like. PoN is more energy-efficient because people are already viewing nudes so it's a kill two birds with one stone kind of thing.

The first coin that will use this technology is called SPANK. SPANK can be mined by submitting your nudes to the validators called BANK.  SPANK BANK validators will rank the nudes from 1-10 and after 20 validations are complete, the average rank will determine how many new coins are added to the blockchain and given to the miner.

286,Your Hardware Wallet CAN be drained- even IF you keep your seed phrase secure! Are you safe? Please learn how to Revoke Allowances!,11u9jf4,"I see more and more people here reporting that they have been hacked, so I figured I'd write this post.  **TL:DR** is on the bottom for those impatient crypto souls :)  If even one person is saved, my late night rambling is worth it. I'm not a pro by ANY means, but I've been around the block long enough to know a thing or two, and lost a few dollars here and there ;)  The goal of this post is to be as straight forward as possible, like if I was explaining this to a 5 year old. If you're experienced, you may find it a little boring.

Most new investors dabble in shitcoins available on DEX's while looking for those 1000x gains. They dig through telegram and discord channels looking for the next ETH. Not only are they new, and inexperienced, but now they're digging in the deep end of the pool. This is where the risk lies. The scammers love the deep end of the crypto pool...

Most **crypto investors think that by having a hardware wallet and keeping their crypto on one, they are immune to being hacked and robbed.** If you are one of those people (like I was in 2018), **you are wrong**. The old school wrench attack is not your worry here. **Not revoking allowances is...**

For starters, did you ever interact with ANY smart contract using your hardware wallet? If so, you gotta do some ""clean up"". By that, I don't mean disconnecting from a dapp in MetaMask. That won't help you, even if it makes you feel better.

**\*\*\*This token approval allowance check has to be done for every blockchain\*\*\***

*You can use etherscan or bsc scan to manually verify allowances on both chains if you do not feel confident using revoke dot cash. I know I didn't feel confident using it myself, until I verified the website through multiple sources.*

&#x200B;

Go to revoke(dot)cash and paste your wallet address,

or go to:

https://etherscan(dot)io/tokenapprovalchecker

*Better yet! To be safe, go to the legitimate etherscan website you always use, click on ""More"" in the right hand top corner, and under ""Services"" you will find the ""Token Approvals"" that will lead to the exact same link, as above :)*

*As to revoke(dot)cash, I wrote it like that so anybody can just type it in themselves without worrying about clicking on random links from reddit :)*

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*DON'T JUST GOOGLE THOSE LINKS, PHISHING LINK DO SHOW UP!!! STAY SAFE!!!\*\*\***

What did you find?

Uniswap? Curve? 1inch? Maybe a shitcoin contract you interacted with 2 years ago?

Should you revoke allowances for an old school dapp such as Uniswap or Curve? **You bet you should!** What if THEY get taken for a ride due to a bug in their smart contract? Your money will be at risk.

Disconnecting your wallet from a dapp app doesn't keep you safe. This is a great explanation of why that is the case:

## Revoking approvals vs. disconnecting apps: what's the difference?

It's easy to confuse these two processes, but they are fundamentally different:

* **Disconnecting your wallet** from a dapp involves cancelling permission for it to see your public address and your token balances, and, depending on what you originally consented to, stopping it from initiating transactions (although *not* executing them) and viewing past activity.
* **Revoking an approval/allowance** means a dapp can no longer access the contents of your wallet and move them around.

*Source:* [https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4446106184731-How-to-revoke-smart-contract-allowances-token-approvals](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4446106184731-How-to-revoke-smart-contract-allowances-token-approvals)

Here is a screenshot I will use as a reference:

https://preview.redd.it/h45o0oyo2eoa1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1b39d7ae26519ae61dfca1ce794944c739030e1e

Shitcoin galore, mostly :D

Now imagine there is USDC here, with an **Unlimited Allowance**, and an **Authorized Spender you don't know**. That contract **will be able to drain** your funds even if they are on a **hardware wallet, hot wallet, metamask, paper wallet-** you name it.

You **won't even have to approve the transaction**, you already did it once before if it says **Unlimited**.

Chances are, you didn't even know that you approved the smart contract to drain your wallet. Hey, I didn't know! I just clicked next!

Look at the Angela token authorized spender- would you trust that smart contract with your money if instead of some Angela shitcoin it was authorized to spend all your USDC? You sure wouldn't!

One day you wake up, and **your money is gone**. It happened to a few people here recently. One guy lost like **$250k**. **His money was in a hardware wallet**, safe, secure, locked away. It didn't matter. That's some life changing money to a lot of us regular working folks. People jumped from roof tops over losing much less.

Most of us are not experts in Solidity. If the wallet says we gotta approve a blind transaction, we do. Obviously, most of us can't read code, and the people stealing from us know that's our greatest weakness...

**TL:DR**

**So to reiterate,**

Check ALL your addresses

Revoke ALL the allowances (do this monthly, or even more frequently)

Most of all, **DO NOT USE YOUR HARDWARE/ HOLDING WALLET TO INTERACT WITH SMART CONTRACTS!**

Your safest bet is to transfer your assets you are gonna play around with to a hot wallet, and interact with the smart contract you gotta interact with from that wallet only. No exceptions.

It's really easy to lose your money in this space. Crypto is not very user friendly yet. One wrong click can make you go broke.

Learn, invest, and **stay safe** :)

287,Thoughts on Diversification When Investing Small Amounts,11u9evm,"I wanted to have a discussion about diversification of assets when only investing small amounts. I myself, and I think many others on here, want to be a part of crypto, but unfortunately cannot invest too much. I obviously know the benefits of diversification when having large amounts of money invested in something. But my question is, is it still worth it to diversify if you're only DCAing maybe $100 or $200 a month? Or with that small of an investment, should I just stick to investing in one of the bigger, ""safer"" assets like Bitcoin and just call it a day? 

Also, if you think diversification is still important, how would you go about it? Would you split a $100 DCA into smaller chunks and buy small amounts of a few different assets, or alternate every month (buying $100 of one asset one month, and buying $100 of another asset the next month)? 

Obviously I'm not going to automatically do what people on here say, but I just wanted to get an idea of what everyone thinks of this. Thanks for any responses!",grundlesquatch,42,8,0.72

I bet at least one of us has been socially engineered into disclosing our key phrase during a game of drug fueled charades... I'm not judging and you shouldn't either, criminals are wily and use many tactics to get the goods. The goods being our sweaty bags of tokens.   


The FTC has some things to say about scammers such as: ""**Never mix online dating and investment advice**. If you meet someone on a dating site or app, and they want to show you how to invest in crypto, or asks you to send them crypto, that’s a scam. ""   


They might even ask you to pay for sex with crypto, don't do this unless prostitution is legal where you plan to do the dirty, because if it's not the police won't help you get your money back if your hooker doesn't put out, and that would be doubly sad.    


Or ""**A scammer pretends to be a celebrity who can multiply any cryptocurrency you send them.** But celebrities aren’t contacting you through social media. It’s a scammer. And if you click on an unexpected link they send or send cryptocurrency to a so-called celebrity’s QR code, that money will go straight to a scammer and it’ll be gone. ""  


If Willy Nelson starts texting you asking for some THC coin it's maybe... okay probably, a scam.  


""**Scammers impersonate well-known companies.** These come in waves, and scammers might say they’re from Amazon, Microsoft, FedEx, your bank, or many others. They’ll text, call, email, or send messages on social media — or maybe put a pop-up alert on your computer. They might say there’s fraud on your account, or your money is at risk — and to fix it, you need to buy crypto and send it to them. But that’s a scam. If you click the link in any message, answer the call, or call back the number on the pop-up, you’ll be connected to a scammer. ""     


Scamazon 1984, Microsoftcore, and Feds Expressing Themselves are not companies that will ask you for crypto, don't send anyone claiming to be them your keys or anything else.  


""  **Scammers impersonate government agencies, law enforcement, or utility companies.** They might say there’s a legal problem, 	that you owe money, or your accounts or benefits are frozen as part of an investigation. They tell you to solve the problem or protect your money by buying cryptocurrency. They might say to send it to a wallet address they give you — for “safe keeping.” Some scammers even stay on the phone with you as they direct you to a cryptocurrency ATM and give step-by-step instruction on how to insert money and convert it to cryptocurrency. They’ll direct you to send the crypto by scanning a QR code they give you, which directs the payment right into their digital wallet — and then 	it’s gone. ""

Crypto investing always seems to have a negative reaction in the press and most stories people share are either massive losses, forgotten passwords and being hacked. 

It’s a stigma I think we need to move away from and we should be focusing on more positive attributes of crypto as it becomes more main stream.

What investment have you made in crypto that you either did well on, are a firm believer in or think has a good usage?

292,My opinion on bank crisis (why I think it is not related to crypto).,11u6t63,"I will try to explain it as short as I possibly can.
First of all, we all know that banks are literally detached with system and states (without a state, credits, fundings, and obviosly sistem itself-banks wont be able to operate). They are protected by law and state (they have legitimate power to chase us for our money obligations related to them-which is system related). They are privileged. In return of that, they have to listen everything that the state itself and government says. That is why money printing and laundering (as all of us are highly conscious they do) is allowed to them with state's eyes closed. System can make profit out of them and use it. They can cover their dirty money that way. I would call it ""legalised mafia work"".
That system is working that way many years back and it is not a secret. It had to break at some point, as we all are aware that crisis is worldwide and economics is in total destruction, inflation is literally highest in the room.
Crypto, on the other side is for my opinion on the completelly other track. Common attacking on it exists because people's eyes are opening and they can't lie us an hide from us like they used to be. People are waking up and realising that crypto is much bigger than they thought it would be and much more reliable and dependable than banks and stocking money in banks, so they decided to give it a try. 
So, why would government make the stocks of crypto go incredably up if they know that it is something that they can't control like any other thing and we know how much war-likely they are opened to crypto. Doing everything to sabotage it and convince people that crypto world is world of lies and thiefes, and not their. So why would they intentionally make the stocks go up? Makes no sence to me. They know we arent fools and that none would believe them in their ""good intentions."" Maybe they figured out that it is something much bigger then the system and now they try to find a way to get along with it ""without notice"" and to ""join it"" so they could make higher profit and control every platform or market.
But I still dont thing that the prices going up has to do anything with them directly. Makes no sense to make something you want to destroy (its value) more worthy. No conspiracy, just an interesting coincidence in timing.

293,My Reasoning for Why the Banking Collapse Wasn’t Aimed at Crypto,11u5gcd,"The last couple of days articles about the banking collapse being caused to try and take out crypto have been all over this subreddit. There are a couple reasons that come to my mind right off the bat for why this would not be the case. 

Looking at the banks and how they were either structured or run by the executives higher interest rates were eventually going to kill them. Signature Bank for example was locked in to short term 3-6 year loans at extremely low rates compared to now. If we take a look at Credit Suisse the bank had not only under performed for over a decade but it has been paying billions in fines at the same time! 

Taking a look at this from another example is good old fashion heard mentality. Over the last week now rumors have run crazy resulting in regional banks, that have lower capital requirements, having billions in cash taken out. Well if all of your friends and family are doing it and putting their money in one of the big 4 then odds are you will to it’s just human nature. 

This final reason I saved for last because it is just plain sad but does anyone think Powell would be that smart? Causing a bank run which only cause crypto banks to fold would be challenging but theoretically could be done. Powell just isn’t that smart though to do that and to think he is just look at the state of the economy! The guy cares a lot about his reputation and legacy something that with this run is even further blown up compared to just a week ago. I hate to say it he just plain couldn’t pull that off if you are asking me.

297,[Satire] Craig Wright use article 49.3 to be recognized as Satoshi Nakamoto,11u4535,"*Repost, the tag was wrong, apologies!*

This is the BIG news of today !

After the use of article 49.3, decided on Thursday by Emmanuel Macron, Craig decided to do the same to be finally recognized as Satoshi Nakamoto by the French Autorities. He declared it on twitter early today:

[As you see, he proclaimed it on twitter](https://preview.redd.it/oyinvb4h8doa1.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9087236cd3e5c6da34939159ba15db4ac2df94af)

**What is the 49.3 Article ?**

*""The Prime Minister may, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers, engage the responsibility of the Government before the National Assembly on the vote on a finance or social security financing bill. In this case, this project is considered adopted, unless a motion of censure, tabled within the following twenty-four hours, is voted under the conditions provided for in the preceding paragraph. The Prime Minister may, in addition, use this procedure for another bill or a bill per session.""*

**How does it works ?**

*""During the vote on a bill or a private member's bill, the Prime Minister may decide to engage the responsibility of the Government. In this case:*

1 - *The use of Article 49.3 of the Constitution is subject to prior deliberation in the Council of Ministers.*

2 - *The bill or the proposal of law is then deemed adopted unless a motion of censure is tabled within 24 hours and signed by at least one tenth of the members of the National Assembly.""*

People throwing cobblestone to the policemen. They can't believe it.

298,Crypto rallies as banks collapse and the St Louis Financial Stress index is yet to show signs of systemic financial system stress.,11u448p,"In the wake of the collapse of banks with large crypto exposures and crypto related services, along with the US federal government backstopping depositors crypto has rallied. In the last week Bitcoin has rallied 33%. Ethereum 21.86%

Banking and financial system stress are intrinsically linked to the use and value of cryptocurrencies. So what is the current health of the overall US and global financial system?

Oddly enough the St Louis Financial Stress Index, which has registered the Russian default and collapse of Long Term Capital Management, the dot com bust, September 11, 2001, obviously the 2008 financial crisis, the Greek credit crisis and concern over US financial situation involving rating agencies downgrades of US treasuries, a collapse in oil prices during 2015-16, and Covid-19 shutdowns have yet to register the recent turmoil in the banking sector.

It should be noted, however, the most recent update to the index today only accounts for conditions up until March 10th.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI4

This was developed after the 2008 financial crisis to gauge the amounts of systemic financial stress in the system. You can see it surge through the financial crisis, a rise during the Greek credit crisis and concerns over US government financial situation when treasuries were downgraded by rating agencies in 2011, being a bit above zero during the oil plunge in 2015-2016, and a surge during COVID -19 shutdowns promoting the fed to intervene in treasury markets.

So far it seems nothing about the latest banking issues are showing up in the index but I also just realized that the latest numbers are only up until March 10th. It will be interesting to see if there is a rise in the index next week.

*The STLFSI4 measures the degree of financial stress in the markets and is constructed from 18 weekly data series: seven interest rate series, six yield spreads and five other indicators. Each of these variables captures some aspect of financial stress. Accordingly, as the level of financial stress in the economy changes, the data series are likely to move together.*

*How to Interpret the Index: The average value of the index, which begins in late 1993, is designed to be zero. Thus, zero is viewed as representing normal financial market conditions. Values below zero suggest below-average financial market stress, while values above zero suggest above-average financial market stress.*

What will the index look like next week? And how will this index correlate work both on chain blockchain activity and prices of crypto related assets?",Justin534,13,4,0.63

You need a reddit account to create a vault. Your vault must be created in the mobile app.

When you create your vault, you need to SECURELY record 2 things:

1. Your vault password (you need this to access your vault via reddit on another device and work with items in your vault)

2. Your vault seed (you need this to import your vault into a wallet - more on that below).


**If an attacker gains access to your reddit account, unless they also have one of the pieces of information above, they DO NOT have access to your vault.**

Likewise, if an attacker has access to your vault seed, they have access to EVERYTHING in your vault, without having any access to your reddit account.

You can actually access your reddit vault outside of accessing your reddit account at all, by using a 3rd party wallet. (Metamask is super popular for this).

To access your vault in Metamask [follow this guide] (https://www.reddit.com/user/nanooverbtc/comments/wkfivm/instructions_to_add_arbitrum_novas_network_and/).

Let's go back in time. What happend in **2013** & **2010**? 

&#x200B;

**2010**

 ""On August 15 2010, it was discovered that block 74638 contained a transaction that created 184,467,440,737.09551616 bitcoins for three different addresses. Two addresses received 92.2 billion bitcoins each, and whoever solved the block got an extra 0.01 BTC that did not exist prior to the transaction. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed.

A new version of the client was published within five hours of the discovery that contained a soft forking change to the consensus rules that rejected output value overflow transactions (as well as any transaction that paid more than 21 million bitcoins in an output for any reason). The block chain was forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the ""bad"" block chain, the ""good"" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691 at which point all nodes accepted the ""good"" blockchain as the authoritative source of Bitcoin transaction history.

The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain. Therefore, the bitcoins created by it do not exist either. While the transaction does not exist anymore, the 0.5 BTC that was consumed by it does. It appears to have come from a faucet and has not been used since.""

[Source\_2010](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident)

&#x200B;

**2013**

**What went wrong?**

""A block that had a larger number of total transaction inputs than previously seen was mined and broadcasted. Bitcoin 0.8 nodes were able to handle this, but some pre-0.8 Bitcoin nodes rejected it, causing an unexpected fork of the blockchain. The pre-0.8-incompatible chain (from here on, the 0.8 chain) at that point had around 60% of the mining hash power ensuring the split did not automatically resolve (as would have occurred if the pre-0.8 chain outpaced the 0.8 chain in total work, forcing 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain).

In order to restore a canonical chain as soon as possible, BTCGuild and Slush downgraded their Bitcoin 0.8 nodes to 0.7 so their pools would also reject the larger block. This placed majority hashpower on the chain without the larger block, thus eventually causing the 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain.

During this time there was at least one large double spend. However, it was done by someone experimenting to see if it was possible and was not intended to be malicious.""

&#x200B;

 **What went right ?**

\- The split was detected very quickly.

\- The right people were online and available in IRC or could be contacted directly.

\- Marek Palatinus (Slush) and Michael Marsee (Eleuthria of BTCGuild) quickly downgraded their nodes to restore a pre-0.8 chain as canonical, despite the fact that this caused them to sacrifice significant amounts of money.

\- Deposits to the major exchanges and payments via BitPay were also suspended (and then un-suspended) very quickly.

\- Fortunately, the only attack on a merchant was done by someone who was not intending to actually steal money

315,Better fraud/scam protection is needed for easier mass adaptation of crypto.,11tymc1,"**Problem:**

One of the biggest issues I see (and also complaints) with crypto is that it is too easy to get scammed. I don’t think this happens disproportionately in crypto, since thousands of people are scammed every day on their debit cards. The real issue with crypto is unless you are paying for some kind of recovery service (that doesn’t happen to just be another scam) you are completely out of luck and lost all your money. 

**How it’s handled now:** 

Transaction fee’s and insurance really. When a claim is filed with a bank they attempt to reclaim the funds from the merchant, if they can’t the bank and visa (or whoever) split the cost. Visa covers this from the fees they charge on every transaction and the bank covers with overdraft and other maintenance fees. 

**How crypto can address this:**

Provide a similar service. Maybe not to the extent that visa or the banks can offer but what about a blockchain insurance company. They could set up a wallet to promote better security and offer transaction protection for a small additional fee. In the event your assets are lost due to fraud they either have on hand investigators to track down the funds or they outsource. Because they cover these costs they could offer 80% back (whether they can successfully recover or not) and use the 20% of the funds they do recover to help fund this pool. 

It definitely isn’t a perfect solution but I genuinely think there’s the basis for a good idea there. I’d love to hear other people’s thoughts!

**Edit:**

To add there are many options that do not involve centralizing (although I don’t see why a centralized option would be a bad thing). 

Things like two factor could be added as a wallet feature as well as built in black listed addresses where scams could be reported. You could also have one with customizable controls only allowing certain types of transactions or addresses. There’s definitely a lot of room for improvement between where we are and centralization.",robbie5643,83,5,0.63

But the current price-levels may be worth a lot more than we though. One way to “measure“ the importance of a level is to see what percentage of the whole circulating supply has been bought there. Areas where a lot of the supply was bought up act as the most important support/resistance areas.

318,[SERIOUS] The Banks Are Just As Suspect As Crypto Exchanges During The FTX Collapse…They Are Just Sanctioned By The Fed To Do It,11ty5ha,"If you’ve continued to follow the fallout of [Silicon Valley Bank](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/15/1163269781/silicon-valley-bank-svb-collapse-history](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/15/1163269781/silicon-valley-bank-svb-collapse-history)) (SVB), you’ve no doubt been made aware that [FRC is fighting for its life](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1144753/first-republic-bank-fighting-for-its-life-as-rescue-reveals-bad-news](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1144753/first-republic-bank-fighting-for-its-life-as-rescue-reveals-bad-news)). FRC is the 14th largest bank in the United States and it’s collapse would signal that SVB was not a lone actor, and there are number of banks that were using deposits on long term bonds that are now worth a whole lot less than they paid for them and is bringing their solvency into question if a second full on bank run were to occur.

The market is aware of the risk, and they have reacted appropriately and their stock has tanked as a result.

But that’s okay, because a number of banks have decided to [provide FRC with liquidity](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-banks-to-infuse-first-republic-with-30-billion-to-stabilize-troubled-lender-192748893.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-banks-to-infuse-first-republic-with-30-billion-to-stabilize-troubled-lender-192748893.html)) on uninsured consumer deposits so they are able to pay their customers in the event a bank run were to happen.

**Does this remind anyone of anything that happened in crypto over the last 6 months?**

CZ and Binance decide to sell FTT and tweets about it, the token crashes and because FTX holds most of its $$ in FTT FTX has no money to pay back deposits.

**A bank run happens on FTX.**

FTX collapses, crypto crashes and the entire crypto market and the stability of every exchange and all stablecoin come into question.

So what happens next?

The crypto community ask for proof of reserves, we want to know how much money is in the accounts and whether everything lines up with what exchanges and stable coins have been saying.

Rumours start to fly as we see exchanges sending money to each other, millions of dollars are being passed back and forth between exchanges and there are no reason given by the exchanges, just regular bookkeeping and accounting.

Eventually the news moves on and people forget about the scandal and the subsequent questionable transactions.

This is the exact same story, but on a much larger scale.
[Jamie Diamond, Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen]([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-the-30-billion-rescue-of-first-republic-bank-003752506.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-the-30-billion-rescue-of-first-republic-bank-003752506.html)) get on a call in a panic because they are worried about the liquidity of FRC. If FRC fails, the confidence of every “regional” bank is called into question, and even some of the large national banks will be a cause for concern.

They then come up with a plan to get **11 BANKS!** To contribute to the liquidity pool to help save FRC.

\- JP Morgan (JPM) **$5 billion**

\- Citi Group (C) **$5 billion**

\- Wells Fargo (WFC) **$5 billion**

\- Bank of America (BA) **$5 billion**

\- Goldman Sachs (GS) **$2.5 Billion**

\- Morgan Stanley (MS) **$2.5 Billion**

\- U.S. Bancorp (USB) **$1 billion**

\- Trust (TFC) **$1 billion**

\- PNC (PNC) **$1 billion**

\- State Street (STT) **$1 billion**

\- Bank of New York Mellon (BK) **$1 billion**

**This is the same scenario that the crypto exchanges went through, liquidity was gone, they kept each other afloat, only this is at a much larger scale. The only difference is that banks are heavily regulated by the fed, and are required to be more transparent with their actions so we know about it. Whereas crypto exchanges could do this behind the scenes making it mostly hearsay.**

I think the questions you should be asking are;

A) What is the **real** fallout going to be if FRC collapses, contagion etc into the banking systems and the banks that fund crypto

B) Why is the FED so involved and keen on saving these bad actors? What happens to interest rates and QT if it does, and how much liquidity will be pumped into the market to save the economy again?

C) How will crypto be affected  as a result?

D) Is the liquidity crisis actually over for crypto exchanges?

I'm sure there are many more to be asked, but it is something the crypto world needs to keep an eye on.

**tl;dr**: If FRC collapses, it could be the second large domino and could mean crazy things for the crypto market, but im not sure which direction it will go. If exchanges, stablecoins and reserves are not impacted by the collapse or contagion it could cause the value to skyrocket. If there are big players in the space impacted, it could result in a massive crash and failures of Stablecoins or Exchanges.",Tallfuck,24,3,0.55
319,Day Trading Can Be a Recipe for Disaster,11txo44,"
Cryptocurrency exchanges have become a popular destination for investors looking to make quick profits by day trading. But what most people don't realize is that these exchanges aren't always on your side.

In fact, many exchanges actually encourage day trading, even though studies have shown that 80% of day traders lose their money in the long run. Why? Because these exchanges make money on the volume of trades, not on the actual earnings of their users.

But history has proven time and time again that holding onto well-known investments is key to building long-term wealth. Instead of chasing quick profits through day trading, consider holding onto solid investments that have proven themselves over time.

keep in mind when you tempted to jump into day trading, remember that the odds are stacked against you. Instead, focus on building a strong portfolio of well-known investments that will stand the test of time.

It’s an invasion of privacy but most of all it’s inconvenient and a waste of times and extra steps that are unneeded. With crypto you can literally step over the bank so they don’t squeeze you for fees everywhere.

I've never been a large player in this game but I had a few k worth of usd in it. My money wasn't spread on big guys btc, eth and so on. I had it fixed on one particular player. I won't disclose the name but it sits comfortably at 5000 rank on coinmarketcap now. Way away from public attention, lol.

Anyways, I figured that if I want to make a shot in here, I should aim for something rather cool and outstanding in the field. That was my main reason to shift my side money towards it.

And to be honest I am glad with my choice (atleast was glad...). Up until earlier this year  when I checked my MEW balance (my ether wallet) and saw zeros. My initial thought was that the coin went balistic towards the ground and reached zeroes and became useless piece of trash. As I got myself back to grip I inspected it closure since I knew that sometimes apps updates and show nonsenses but not this time.

My funds were sent to a newly created wallet (at this date it has 2 transactions - one in, one out). Then was sent to pancakeswap and swapped to other token and in some other currency got into this wallet ( 0x870CdF31020A7D10F604A41bA90b87A76F0a2903 ).

I don't wan't to disclose the invested project name, or my wallet name or any exact date since some of you will be quick to judge that the project was shite and so on, this post is not about that.

And I know that I will never recover the coins I had therefore f.ck this particuliar wallet owner. 

What I can do is to learn from this story and move on, probably put some money aside and atleast buy some of my original stake again before the bull season stars. 

A few more interesting aspects that I should mention - since 2022 october I started to get messages from facebook and twitter.

Facebook would message me once a month or so with a  

""Did you log in to Facebook from somewhere new?. It looks like someone tried to lon in to your account on 17 october at 13:14 using an unknown device"". 

I didn't pay attention since I am kinda nobody and no one should be interested in hacking to my social media account. 

 And from 2022 december I would get emails from twitter with captions like:

,,We noticed an attempt to log in to your account. ______ that seems suspicious. Was this you?""

Suspicious login details would be: Springfield, Safari on Iphone.


First of all, I am from Europe. Secondly, I hate iphones. 

During the period from 2022 october till 2023 january I kinda ignored all the messages thinking that the failed attempts proves that these people don't know my passwords and cannot do anything at all. Yet the story laters shows differents things.

Worth to mention, that I held my crypto wallet on my smartphones, did frequent antivirus runs to check for any risk. I don't see any real threats where I could get some spyware or something.

As you can see, Forbes as dropped off the part about this banking failure being once again, just like 2008, the fault of government policy and regulators. Clearly, somebody with a lot of power got upset and forced a change in the title, which little ole Forbes quietly complied with. And we call US media ""free"". Right.

Remember all these media houseshave a process where articles have to pass through editors to be published in the first place. This piece would have had to have been approved already, such that it's someone else later on, likely external to Forbes, who had their feathers ruffled and demanded change.

In total there are 329,704 cards, one for each Redditor who has appeared on a Moon distribution CSV file from rounds 1-37.

**These are NOT NFTs**, just a fun visual card you can look at. All the values on the card are stored in a database I maintain, so your card has fixed values that won't change unless I want them to (#centralization). Of course, anyone who knows photoshop or what ""inspect element"" means can fake the stats, but you can always verify if they are being honest by entering their username into the tool.

I'll explain some details later on, but for those who just want to see their own card, the website page is [ccmoons.com/card](https://ccmoons.com/card)**.**

Here are some randomly generated cards that I liked:

If your avatar doesn't appear, this means that you haven't earned any karma in the previous 37 moons distributions, or you don't have an avatar.

Each card has the following attributes:

* HP
* Attack
* Defense
* Speed
* Overall (the average of HP, Attack, Defense, Speed)
* Type (Normal, Water, Flying, Grass, Ground, Fire, Fighting, Electric, Fairy, Ghost, Dragon)
* 2 Moves (e.g. quick attack, hyper beam, surf, etc.)
* Rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Ultra Rare, Legendary)
* Moons: Moon balance at the time I ran the script
* Karma: Sum of all karma on Moon distribution files

# How are the Stats generated?

Each stat has its own custom formula, based on information about your Moons holdings, Moon transactions/tipping, karma, subreddit activity, and account age. I won't divulge the exact formulas, but generally speaking more moons, tipping, transactions, karma, and account age relate to higher stats.

There's also a random component for each stat. Each user has a base value stat from the formula, but to introduce an element of luck, the final statistic is drawn from a Normal(base\_stat, 15) distribution.

**The average of each statistic is \~50.** But this includes many users who were hardly active, so I expect most people who see this post to have higher stats than 50.

# How is the Rarity generated?

Rarity was completely random! A ""weak"" card can still be Ultra Rare or Legendary

|Rarity|Number of Cards|
|:-|:-|
|Basic|N/A (if an error occurs or you didn't earn karma from rounds 1-36, a default card will appear)|
|Common|164,552|
|Uncommon|131,985|
|Rare|24,904|
|Ultra Rare|7,932|
|**Legendary**|**330**|

# How are the Types generated?

Types were completely random with some being more common than others. The type of the card also determined the card's styling (background image + card texture)

|Rarity|Number of Cards|
|:-|:-|
|Water|49,390|
|Normal|48,827|
|Grass|33,038|
|Fire|32,911|

|Fairy|16,512|

|Dragon|6,597|

# How are the Moves generated?

Moves were generated randomly based on your type.

331,How I've Been Investing in Crypto with Low Income.,11tti1b,"Greetings from Portugal. So a great part of us are in the age of 20-35, which means that with the actual inflation you either live with your parents or after you pay rent/house there isn't much money left. That's my case in portugal where I live with my girlfriend and rent is 50% of total house income.

That's why most of us became interested in cryptocurrencies, to have more financial stability.

With this, I believe it's it's helpful for a lot of us learning how to invest with low income. Even for those who have good money but don't wanna risk much.

In my own experience, **if I had saved money, I would feel less guilty about occasionally resuming bad habits I gave up, like smoking and eating fast food**, because these activities are no longer as detrimental to the economy as they once were, and since we are all human, we do deserve to spend money on fun activities. It's all because to that important investing year.

**Then what I did and still do is investing 10% of the money I have left before payday.**

One strategy I use is to **divide my investment into two parts: one for long-term holdings and one for short-term investments.** For my long-term holdings, I invest in well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. For my short-term investments, I seek out smaller, emerging cryptocurrencies with the potential for rapid growth for my short-term investments.

I hope this has benefited other low-income people, especially those who are from nations with uncertain economies.",Not_a__Lawyer,28,10,0.66

I know that losing the custody of the tokens is never good, but I would like to know what are the best ways to stake USDT.

Appart of the normal way where I could deposit on binance or coinbase and stake USDT direclty, I thought in (not sure if possible), to take a loan and using my USDT as collateral but instead of staking and lose the custody of the tokens get like ADA or other coin that we can delegate and never lose custody of it.

The upcoming Ethereum upgrades (Shanghai and Capella Upgrades, collectively known as Shapella) are expected to complete in mid April 2023 and will enable staking withdrawals for the first time since ETH staking was introduced.

You can continue staking with no action required, and your assets will be secure during this upgrade period. If you’d like to withdraw your staked ETH, here’s what you need to know: 

We expect you'll be able to submit unstaking requests from your Coinbase account within 24 hours after the upgrade.

The time taken to process unstaking requests is determined by Ethereum protocol. We anticipate the Ethereum protocol will take weeks to months to process requests immediately following the upgrade, so you may need to remain patient during this time. You’ll be able to view an estimated processing period in your account.

For those seeking immediate liquidity, Coinbase offers a utility token, cbETH, that lets users unlock the value of their staked ETH.

With this upgrade, customers will become liable for taxes owed on any staked ETH (ETH2) or cbETH rewards earned leading up to the upgrade and after. 

When these upgrades are complete, Ethereum will have officially shifted from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, making it more secure, scalable, and energy-efficient.",BushyOreo,23,8,0.72
336,How much Bitcoin is really worth considering inflation?,11trmer,"**Hey fellow redditors,**

**As I saw news about FED's pumping $300B into US banks, and pushing BTC over 26k$, I was wondering, is that really true price of the BTC?**

**So, I took annual inflation report and did some math. If someone doesn't know, inflation is around 6%.**

**Assuming an inflation rate of 6% per year, we can use the following formula to calculate the real value of $26,000 today:** 

Real value = Nominal value / (1 + inflation rate)\^n

Where n is the number of years since the nominal value was measured.

Assuming the nominal value of $26,000 was measured one year ago, we can plug in the values:

Real value = $26,000 / (1 + 0.06)\^1 Real value = $24,528.30

**So the real value of $26,000 one year ago, adjusted for 6% inflation, is $24,528.30 today.**

**And if we want to convert this to the value of Bitcoin, we would need to look up the exchange rate of Bitcoin to the US dollar at the time the $26,000 nominal value was measured. Assuming the exchange rate was 1 BTC = $26,000, the real value of 1 BTC today would be:**

Real value of 1 BTC = $24,528.30 / $26,000 = 0.9442 BTC

**So if inflation was 6% and the nominal value of Bitcoin was $26,000 one year ago, the real value of Bitcoin today would be approximately 0.9442 BTC.**

**Let me know what are your thoughts on this, is this correct or I do something wrong here?**",AncestralMano,61,3,0.56
337,Ethereum Developers Have Scheduled The Shanghai Upgrade For April 12 - Shanghai Coincides With Regulatory Scrutiny Which May Analyze The Upgrade,11trddr,"Shanghai has been considered a crucial upgrade as it will allow ETH to be unstaked. Since staking was enabled in November 2020, ~15% of ETH supply, or USD 29.67B, has been committed to staking. 

Risks most typically associated with Ethereum upgrades have been of a technical nature. For example, upgrades can involuntarily introduce critical bugs into software. In 2019, Ethereum developers delayed the Constantinople upgrade after an audit firm discovered bugs in the new software. However, recent regulatory developments have attracted attention to Ethereum’s governance processes. 

The New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) charges against KuCoin for allegedly operating an unregistered securities venue, include the assertion that ETH is a security. The NYAG alleged that ‘ETH’s development and management is largely driven by a small number of developers who hold positions in ETH and stand to profit from the growth of the network and the related appreciation of ETH.’ 

Court documents also describe Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), and claim that ‘Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation retain significant influence over Ethereum and are often a driving force behind major initiatives’ which are material to the asset’s price. Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation are said to have played ‘key roles’ in the shift to PoS. 

This week Gensler said PoS tokens implicate securities laws. Gensler explained that blockchain networks often have ‘a small group of entrepreneurs and developers’ and that ‘[t]he investing public is investing anticipating a return, anticipating something on these tokens…’ that have been staked. Gensler’s answer was prompted after he was asked by reporters about CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam’s view that ETH is a commodity.

In a 2018 speech, former SEC director Bill Hinman said ‘putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions.’ According to Hinman, ‘[o]ver time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required.’

Takeaway: The NYAG and Gensler have asserted that Ethereum’s governance processes, i.e. managing upgrades, deciding what to include in upgrades, etc., may impact the token’s regulatory status. 

Hinman alluded to similar consideration when he asserted that ‘sufficiently decentralized networks’ may allow associated assets to not be regulated as securities. While taken together, the NYAG charges, Gensler’s latest remarks, and Hinman’s speech may indicate a lack of consensus, they do also underscore that regulators are interested in networks’ governance processes. 

Upgrades, such as Shanghai, may give regulators an opportunity to assess the perceived decentralization of a network.",xof711,12,1,0.56

341,"Bitcoin returns are almost 50% YTD in 2023. They are great now, but the hardest part is realising that for traders who lost 65% in Bitcoin in 2022, they are not at down 15% from 2022 but rather still almost ~50% down",11tqdub,"I must say I am quite surprised. The markets and this sub has seen so much jubilation since prices and returns are up. Maybe it is just that their voice are drowned out or that they have left the sub due to disappointment, but I have not come across much at all of a dose of reality for hodlers. 

Bitcoin lost around 65% of it’s value from the beginning to the end of 2022. We went from around $46,311.75 to $16,547 thereabout, which amount to about 65% in losses. Yes, 2023 has absolutely started off with a bang, but it is a bang after the dim embers of 2022. We gained nearly 50% thus far for the year, and while they are great numbers, rolling over from 2022, they are just a drop in the bucket in recovery.

If you held on last year from beginning to end, you would have lost 65% of your investment.  If you held on from the start of 2023 till today, you would have gained almost 50% YTD. But remember, you gain *50%* **on 35% remaining from 2022, that is to say you only truly gained \~17.5%. So, you are still down almost 50% from the start of 2022.**

This may be obvious to more experienced traders among us, but many new traders stumble into this pitfall. You make risky bets and if/when you lose, you think you can make it back but there’s a reason investment brokerage and exchanges are so profitable. If you lose money, it takes monumental effort and time to make it back just to breakeven. And ironically, big losses tend to make traders take even more risk and lose even more.

Everybody gets wrapped up in the percentage returns, especially on the media and advertisements telling you all the money you can make but never advise how bad a single loss can set you back. Because most just advertise for platforms that want your fees with total disregard to whether you win or lose. And this is  exactly how they also get you with leverage, leverage(without really in-depth information, extensive research and a strong market edge which very very few traders do/have) is a losing gamble. And even then it’s still risky which is why firms typically hedge by trading the opposite site in another instrument. You will only win with leverage until you lose but trading platform get their fees either way.

I know this whole post is obvious to some but it is definitely not to all. Don’t just dismiss it.All you see in media is the allure of short-term big percentage returns but not the full reality of risk and even a single loss. I think it very much needs to be said.",OneThatNoseOne,113,101,0.81

Just BTC alone has an abysmal 464 coins currently listed as active shorts compared to 106,000 longs according to datamish.com and the same trend is continuing across the board.

Generally speaking that's heavily bullish sentiment because it shows even the investors and companies ""in the know"" don't think this rally is close to failing anytime soon and won't risk losses on shorting hedged and especially unhedged positions.

That's off the heels of a fresh apparent bear trap that assumed the prices would fall due to the collapse of SVB which was known to be friendly to tech startups and crypto specifically. And they aren't the only ones struggling.

While this ecosystem was once dominated by whales, this is now becoming less and less the case. 

# Criticism of Bitcoin 

The main criticism of Bitcoin is that the digital currency will not be fairly distributed. People often argue that if Bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency soon, a very small group of people will hold all the power.

In a way, this is understandable and makes sense for outsiders to see it this way. It is still difficult to explain that Bitcoin is actually the fairest way to launch a new monetary system. Everyone had a chance to participate from the very beginning.

What we are seeing now is that ""people"" are taking an increasingly large share of the entire Bitcoin. While it was still an ecosystem dominated by whales before, we are now seeing more and more small holders who own relatively small amounts of BTC.

# Bitcoin shrimps and crabs

In particular, the so-called shrimps (<1 bitcoin) and crabs (1-10 bitcoin) are currently consuming large amounts of bitcoins. According to Glassnode, shrimps are buying over 100 percent of the annual production of the primary cryptocurrency. In the case of crabs, this is 119 percent

So even if miners sell 100 percent of their production, these two cohorts are still buying more bitcoins. Of course, they are buying this Bitcoin from the market.

As a result, fewer bitcoins are available for sale, and the relative scarcity of the digital currency is increasing. The more bitcoins shrimps and crabs buy, the harder it is to acquire it. Ultimately, this could only have a positive impact on the price.",plug_and_pray,178,156,0.82

SVB -> same.

Credit Suisse -> skipped the dumping, go straight to pump

Conclusion: if God can grant you a wish, you better wish for everyone to go insolvent, crypto business or not, then every crypto bro (whose money is in hardware wallet) will be rich!

Am I right?

P. S. I feel that there is a greater chance that Binance is more insolvent than Credit Suisse as there is not much regulation on it and Binance got rich by being a risk taker so they had this company culture. So I guess the next huge pump will be the fall of Binance?",vnaeli,23,1,0.55

And now a year on I’m more confident in my understanding of crypto. During the frenzy of the bull market it was hard to see what was what.

So after a year of soul searching I’ve re-discovered what drew me to crypto in the first place: decentralisation. In particular, decentralised money.

So these past few months I’ve decided to take it back to basics and focus on sound money and coins that offer store of value. As such I’ll be focussing on BTC, LTC, and XMR. 

I may be totally wrong and will probably miss out on those moonshots but I feel more comfortable DCA in my crypto “principles”.

355,Ingenious scam AD fake a Cointiply promotion to steal users funds,11tln3b,"Cointiply.com is  legit website that offers a ""crypto faucet"" and PTC ads, together with some others way to earn small amounts of Crypto. For ""small amounts"" I mean that every click on the faucet (1 hour cooldown) gives the users more or less 0.0020 USD. After getting to a total of 3.00 USD users can withdraw the earned money in BTC, DOGE , DASH or LTC.

Now, one way to earn some ""coins"" on the website is to click on ads.

Some scammer found an ingenious way to create a new kind of scam. He created an ad and managed to get it listed on the website, faking a promotion on the website and promising to ""double"" the amount deposited via [Coinbase Commerce](https://www.coinbase.com/commerce) presenting it as ""official"" promotion of the website itself.

&#x200B;

[Official website dashboard - PTC ads with the \\""fake\\"" one that is even \\""featured\\"".](https://preview.redd.it/vmvnnw2pj9oa1.jpg?width=1894&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3c64e11d07d9b150d242e05db3bc284f12927248)

Now when you get on the fake ad it's even present the Cointiply logo.

The website request a payment via Coinbase in many different coins. I though that this could be a scam, but to confirm it I sent 2,50 USD in MATIC that I had in an alternate account to prove it. I even got a recepit for it.

&#x200B;

[Recepit with a scam \\""email\\"" - probably used to scam users again](https://preview.redd.it/k1f3atxvj9oa1.jpg?width=1853&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e61946997e61ae2d32e6f41933f14a32dd388eb0)

Now, I think also the email that is on the bottom of the recepit is used to scam the users even more, because they will send an help request there, when they will not get the money on the account.  I didn't tried to write to the email.

I reported this to the Cointiply support and this was the asnwer:

>*​I am sorry to inform you, but there is no double deposit bonus. That advertisement is a scam that is using our likeness. We are fighting to remove that scam when it pops up. If ever you see an ad claiming a double deposit bonus from us, please do let us know where you saw it so we can try to get it taken down, as I have already done so with this one.

357,Why you're witnessing history with crypto like the internet and online shopping boom.,11tl7m4,"The parallel between crypto and the early stages of this is crazy. For starters, crypto started as an idea that is meant to protect people from bank failures, and although it can't fully do that yet, it is the idea that stands. That idea started with Btc. Then you have Ethereum and a host of other projects building massive ecosystems.

The crypto world has literally been through it all and is still going through it all, but even amidst all the chaos there is NFT markets that have started gaining some traction and a collectors desirability. I feel like crypto is gonna be that big catch all thing that'll connect the internet to the real world and services and so on like the payment systems will be connected to that like a massive interlinking web.

Some say this stuff is weird like the metaverse and all those other dystopian sounding ideas, but humans and their curiosity is infinite. Crypto is another massive page in our history that is being written right now. 

If I had to speculate I'd say that by 2030- 2040ish crypto will be fully integrated as many different ideas. And contrary to what everyone says about Btc being old and better stuff existing, it kinda has that Mcdonald's level branding and notoriety that will pretty much see it always exist in one form or another. I think we'll see games and crypto payments pretty much be the norm by that time. Btc will be accepted at most major stores like VISA and so on.

358,I don't believe US banking regulators are trying to kill crypto. Here's why.,11tl7l4,"I've seen a number of posts now about how the Fed and FDIC are hostile towards crypto. But I have not seen any articles, statements, or regulatory actions that have convinced me this is true. Please post links to the reasons why you think this is true if you do.

What I have found, however, are a few misleading headlines and accusations that this is occurring. I know that the head of the SEC believes that many cryptocurrencies are securities. I would also suggest, not all, but there are many cryptocurrencies which meet the definition of a security in my mind. There are literal corporate bonds trading on blockchains right now. Which is awesome! And they are securities.

What I've also found is if you just read certain articles or headlines and take them at face value it could seem like the Fed, FDIC, and OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) are hostile to cryptocurrency. Most people have concluded this based on a joint statement issued by these regulators. Here's that statement:

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230223a1.pdf

If you read the first section of this statement you will read the following: 

*Banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation.*

I don't see anything hostile about this statement. I think the opposite.

The second section is titled ** Liquidity Risks Related to Certain Sources of Funding from Crypto-Asset-Related Entities**

Again I do not see anything hostile to crypto. It basically says crypto is volatile and risky. Deposits from cryptocurrency related customers might have abrupt inflows and outflows. If a bank holds reserves for a stablecoin and there are a large amount of redemptions that bank could see a large outflow of deposits.

The next section is titled **Effective Risk Management Practices**

This section basically just says this is how banks can manage these risks.

1. Analyze deposits from crypto related entities to better understand what dives the in or outflows of those customers, and identify which deposits might have unpredictable volatility.

2. Identify how interconnected those deposits are.

3. Stress test those deposits and have contingency plans if there are large outflows.

4. Make sure to do your due diligence on crypto related customers and understand that if they misrepresent their business or risks of the business there can be large outflows.

There is absolutely nothing I've seen in this statement that is hostile towards crypto. All it says is ""Hey banks!! Don't screw up again on another unregulated financial asset. Manage your risks!""

After 3AC, FTX, Celsius, Terra Luna/UST, Voyager, Blockfi, etc I think what would be wreckless is for financial regulators not to issue a statement like this.

Regulators are concerned about how much any bank exposes itself to crypto not IF they are exposed to crypto. After all the failures we've seen in the crypto space I can't blame them, can you?

I also realized I have no idea what the Comptroller of the Currency is and I still have no interest in finding out 🤷‍♂️

359,"[NO MOONS] Vitalik shares his thoughts on how to use Guardians, Multisig wallets (like Gnosis Safe), and Social Recovery wallets",11tks1t,"Vitalik just posted this to the Ethereum subreddit. It's a good read.

No Moons since I'm copying directly from it:

--------------------------

Multisig wallets (eg. [Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/)) are an easy and safe way to store funds, and can give you most of the key benefits of **self-custody** - namely, your funds not being subject to disappearing because a centralized entity that seemed trustworthy turns out not to be at all - without the risks of having to be personally responsible for your entire security setup. I use a multisig wallet personally to store the bulk of my funds, as does the Ethereum Foundation.

A close cousin of multisig wallets is [social recovery wallets](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html), where a single key can be used to sign transactions but if that key is lost, a group of keys held by other people can be used to recover the funds. Social recovery wallets are much easier than multisig wallets to use, especially with the rise of [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) account abstraction and upcoming wallets like [Soul Wallet](https://twitter.com/zengjiajun_eth/status/1636496326723768320) that will make the technology user-friendly. In general, once social recovery wallets become mature enough, my recommendation will be to use social recovery for hot wallets that store a small portion of a person or organization's funds, and multisigs for cold wallets that store a person or organizations's savings.

Both multisig wallets and social recovery wallets rely on a concept of **guardians**: a set of N addresses, typically held by other people, of which any M can approve an operation (eg. one could set N=6 and M=4). In the case of a multisig wallet, each transaction must be signed off on by M of the N guardians. In the case of a social recovery wallet, there is a single key that can sign transactions, but if that key is lost, M of the N guardians must sign a message to reset the key.

**Two key questions in using multisig wallets and social recovery wallets securely are: (i) whom do you choose as guardians, and (ii) what instructions do you give them?** This post will outline how I think about this issue. The ideas here should mostly apply equally to multisig and social recovery wallets being used to secure funds for individuals and for organizations.

### What do we want out of guardians?

* Minimize the chance that they lose their keys
* Minimize the chance that they collude to steal your money, or get coerced into doing so
* To the extent that the above two risks are unavoidable, the risk of each guardian should be maximally _uncorrelated_ - you want to minimize commonalities that risk situations that will disable or compromise too many of your guardians at the same time.

This answer is simple and short, but it guides all of the choices that I make with regard to guardians.

### It's okay for some of the guardians to be your own devices, but not too many

It makes natural sense to have at least one guardian be a wallet on one of your own devices - it doesn't reduce decentralization to do that, and after all, it _is_ your money. Once you go above one guardian controlled by yourself, however, you get into a tricky tradeoff: you get to trust other people less, but you're also concentrating more power into yourself, which can create a risk if you get hacked, coerced, or incapacitated or die.

My rule of thumb is that enough guardians should be controlled by other people that if you disappear there are enough other guardians left to recover your funds. That is, **you should control at least 1 guardian, and at most N-M guardians**. Also, each guardian should be on a separate device (laptop, phone, old phone, etc).

### Choose guardians who do not often talk to each other or ideally do not know each other

Ideally, the guardians should not know who each other are. This greatly reduces the risk that they collude, and furthermore there is _no good reason_ for them to know each other. If something happens to you, they will still be able to find each other, because there are obvious standard protocols that naturally come to people's minds in such a situation (eg. contact your family).

Also, you want to **minimize correlations between your guardians as much as possible**: don't choose two guardians who live in the same city (or ideally even the same country), or two guardians who use the same type of wallet, and have a balance between different operating systems.

### Guardians should ask a security question before approving an operation

When you ask a guardian to approve an operation for you (in a multisig, this would be any transaction, and in a social recovery wallet, this would be resetting your account's key), they should not simply say yes immediately. This would be a disaster for security: if someone hacks into your chat account, they could scan your messages, figure out who your guardians are, contact each of them and ask them to confirm, and thereby steal your funds.

My preferred protocol to avoid this is to instruct guardians to **ask a security question**. That is, when you ask for a confirmation on your operation, the guardian should ask you something that only the two of you and very few other people know (eg. ""the last time we met, what kind of food did we have?""), and only confirm the operation if you give the correct answer. A natural alternative is voice or video calls, but in the age of AI deepfakes this is weaker evidence than before, and so you may want to combine the voice/video call with asking some kind of security question.

### If you're doing ""degen"" stuff, make sure to have guardians who can respond quickly. Otherwise, this doesn't matter

If you're doing degen stuff with on-chain contracts, you may need to act quickly: pull money out if a contract gets a vulnerability, move money around if you are close to being liquidated, etc. If your needs include this, then you want to find guardians who can act quickly on short notice (and therefore also, guardians in different time zones, so enough guardians to complete a transaction are awake at all times) to protect your funds. If you do not do these kinds of things, however, then speed is not particularly important, and in fact may even be slightly harmful, because convincing people of the need to act urgently is a common social engineering tactic used by hackers and it can be good to have people who are by default mentally averse to that.

### Test each guardian at least once a year

Make a test operation at least once a year. Ideally, make two test operations each year, using half your guardians for one and the other half of your guardians for the other. This makes sure that your guardians haven't forgotten or lost their accounts.

### Advanced: privacy

One of the challenges with guardians today is that the tech does not yet exist to make it possible to protect your financial privacy from your guardians. However, this is a technical problem that can be solved technically: instead of guarding your account directly, the guardians guard a ""lockbox"" contract where the link between your account and the lockbox is hidden. Making the link stay hidden until a recovery needs to be made is pretty easy: for example, your account could have as a guardian a CREATE2 contract that only the lockbox can create. Making the link stay hidden _even after_ a recovery, however, requires more advanced ZK-SNARK tech. Hence, this is a problem that I expect will slowly be solved over the next few years.",Maleficent_Plankton,20,13,0.71
360,I'm glad I didn't give up last year,11tjyg7,"I know we're still not in some crazy bull market yet but it's almost unbelievable to me seeing us pumping up this high. These are prices that seemed unattainable after how low we got. 2022 was a tough year, and seeing my portfolio continuously take a hit was mentally draining. I started investing in 2021 so I had no experience on how to navigate a bear market. There were moments where I got frustrated or sad but I kept DCAing into Bitcoin regardless. Got myself a hardware wallet after reading about victims of Mt. Gox and previous exchanges that went under (thankful for past me doing that) and hunkered down on buying every week regardless of whatever happened. Then FTX's collapse came near the end of the year and we saw Bitcoin drop to 16k. At that point I was looking at a purely down chart and my portfolio was hit even more. Thankfully I didn't put my crypto on anywhere like Celsius or FTX but seeing it down so much hurt. Is it over? Was this effort all for nothing?

I'm thankful I didn't give up. For the first time I'm able to see some unrealized profit from my Bitcoin buys last year.

I think this current scenario that we are seeing play out is more significant for crypto than many of us realise - this is the first time we are seeing a narrative form for the mainstream that traditional banking systems are not as safe as we have all been led to believe and that crypto, whilst still in its infancy is a real option for wealth storing instead of the banks.

Seeing a lot of people getting hacked with big chunks is devastating and begs the question, Are they playing it SAFE? I don't think so. 

The ways people most likely get SCAMMED - 

1. Fake customer support/airdrop/wallet recovery phishing site 


2. Connecting wallet with a Fake Dapp/mining site/investment platform.


3. Through social engineering - mobile hacks, note hacks, file hacks, mail hacks, etc.


Let's find out the best way to avoid these and keep your crypto safe. 


1. DO NOT hold large chunks in hot wallets ( anything above $10K deserves a hardware wallet). 


2. DO NOT use the same wallet for holding and dapp connections. Use separate wallets for separate purposes.


3. DO NOT interact with a Dapp/nft minting/ airdrop site without doing proper research. 


4. DO NOT hold all coins in one wallet. Spread among exchange and different wallets like ledger, Trust wallet, metamask, Citadel, Exodus, or any other industry-established wallets.


5. DO NOT use the same seed phrase in different wallets.


6. DO NOT hold seed phrase on a notepad, keypad, or something. Keeping offline is BEST with some change in the seed which can only be cracked by you. 


7. DO NOT share seed phrase with anybody, anywhere nor even support will ask for it.


8. DO NOT download unpopular crypto games, or earning apps on your device.


9. Do NOT open random doc files on your device. 


10. DO NOT use mining dapps. 


11. Always keep your wallet app locked.


12. Always remove approval of random dapp after connecting to it. 


13. Always write down seed in two different places. 


14. Always stay away from show offing your funds to near persons. 


15. Always follow the above-mentioned things.


16. Always remember nobody cares if you get hacked. Don't have fake hope of getting assets back.

369,Are we in for a bullish couple of months?,11teq0s,"I’ve been bearish since the start of the year (team 12k-13k mid 2023, I really want that discount now that I’m not on the verge of bankruptcy). Recent events have changed my views, however.

Tuesday’s CPI data shows that J.Pow might just have to hike the fed rates yet another 50-75bps next week. We’ve all seen how the rising interest rates have strained banks with SVB’s recent failure (hence the bankruns and the crypto/gold pumps).

The way I see it, this could go one of two ways:

1. Rates get hiked (as they should): potentially more banks fail, and people find safe haven in crypto
2. J.Pow pulls the rug to save the rich: we fall into recession, crypto dumps, and fiat becomes even more worthless (and I don’t get to buy eggs again this year)

I feel like scenario 1 is more likely to happen, and the bull run might just continue for a while.

371,"Keys, keys, keys",11tdrxr,"I've always been confused about the different types of keys, mnemonics, addresses that one can have in crypto. Recently I've been educating myself on the topic. Here's a summary of the differences between these terms, along with the number of keys or addresses that can be generated from each one:

* **Seed phrase:** A string of words used to generate a master key. An unlimited number of accounts, private keys, public keys, and addresses can be generated from a single seed phrase.
* **Master key:** A top-level key derived from the seed phrase. An unlimited number of accounts, private keys, public keys, and addresses can be generated from a single master key.
* **Account key:** A key derived from the master key, used to generate a distinct set of private keys, public keys, and addresses for a specific account. An unlimited number of private keys, public keys, and addresses can be generated from a single account key.
* **Private key:** A secret key used to sign transactions and access cryptocurrency funds. A single private key corresponds to a single public key and a single cryptocurrency address.
* **Public key:** A key derived from a private key, used to receive cryptocurrency funds. A single public key corresponds to a single cryptocurrency address.
* **Address:** A unique identifier used to receive and send cryptocurrency funds. A single cryptocurrency address corresponds to a single public key and a single private key.

In summary, the seed phrase and master key can be used to generate an unlimited number of accounts, private keys, public keys, and addresses. Each account key can generate an unlimited number of private keys, public keys, and addresses. Each private key corresponds to a single public key and a single cryptocurrency address.

377,How can governments destroy or limit the adoption of Bitcoin?,11tckia,"Let’s say you were the US government and you’e becoming ever more concerned with the growing influence of cryptocurrency and it’s bold claim that it will one day replace fiat. It is in your interest to persevere fiat and kill crypto. 

You also quickly realize that trying to shutdown all crypto projects is a fool’s errand as there are thousands of them in different buckets - defi, NFTs, stablecoins, etc. So you set out to make your job easier and destroy faith in crypto and the rest will fall. To do this, you decide to destroy or limit the influence of Bitcoin. If you can take down the original crypto, surely faith in everything else will vanish. 

What you (the government) have done so far:

Go after the crypto-friendly banks. Increase interest rates. This will indirectly cause bank runs. Seize the banks, reassure depositors will be made whole again but those pesky investors are on the hook for their loss. Slowly continue waging war on crypto-friendly banks. 

Future campaigns:

1. Monetary - Tax the hell out of crypto. 30% is for chumps. Raise it to 60-70% on crypto capital gains. And only do it for crypto, stocks are your friends. Software like TurboTax have already separated the two out for you nicely, the groundwork has already been laid. 

This will break the backs of crypto investors. Some won’t report their crypto profits (or losses, who are we kidding!). But if they’ve already reported their crypto activity in past years, we’ll they’re not so anonymous now. You have their wallet addresses. 

2. Access - shutdown crypto exchanges. For all of the talk of “decentralized”, let’s be honest most crypto users have their money on exchanges. Not you keys, not your coins. You won’t get those who have their assets on cold wallets, but those are in the minority. Also shutdown ledger sellers. That’ll make it hard for new users to have cold storages. 

The more technically competent crypto users will not be affected by this. But it will slow down or even freeze adoption since crypto adoption relies on the mass less technically savvy public to have easy interfaces to work with crypto. 

So there you have it. That’s what the government is doing or will probably do in the future to try to kill crypto. 

It is in our interest, those of us who want to see mass crypto adoption one day, to think of these possible roadblocks and try to find solutions for them.

378,A reminder that stable coins like USDC and USDT are a risk if holding them for self custody,11tc522,"While stable coins like USDT and USDC have risks of de-pegging like we recently saw when USDC dropped to $0.86, I wanted to inform some people that there are other risks associated with them.

Unlike traditional crypto that most people are familiar with, like BTC and ETH, where you have complete control of your coins (your keys, your coins), USDC and USDT do not share this same feature. 

USDC and USDT can be frozen at will from the company issuing those stable coins. So practically its like saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" when holding them. So in the event that they are legally required or feel its in the best interest, they can freeze your funds in whatever wallet those coins are held in, and can make them wortless while issuing new coins to replace them. This is good news for exchanges when they get hacked, but also bad news for anyone who wants 100% control over their crypto.

So just remember that even if the stable coin is guaranteed 1:1, you could possibly still fall victim to a frozen account for whatever reason they find necessary.",tranceology3,30,9,0.68

By my opinion, people have a very short memory and are debating that crypto enthusiasts should not talk negative about the banking system, as we need it to by crypto with their debit cards, and we need them to cash out.

Well, we are using a lot of staff and we are doing a lot of things that we see them as negatives, but we have no other choice, cause this is how the civilization is directed atm, but that didn't stop as to call their BS as it is. Banks are just being used to control civilians, in a very effective way. Banks have no trustworthiness, as many times showed, they give 0 shit about people's money. I can remember just few instances on top of my head, without searching the web, how it was used for political control or how the depositors money just disappeared:

* Dissolution of USSR - all depositors money was gone
* Cyprus, banking crisis - they took 6-10% from the depositors for their banks bail out
* Canada, track drivers protest - they blocked supporters bank accounts
* Russia - Ukraine ""war"" - Russian's reserves frozen, Russian citizens money frozen in western banks
* China, bank run - took depositors money, tanks stopped the protest
* Silicon Valley bank collapse - yeah, whatever that is

381,Passive income through crypto.,11tapww,"A lot of people are holding crypto or buying crypto with the hope that it will appreciate in value greatly and they can retire. 

It seems simple and has worked in the past: If you bought $1000 worth Bitcoin 10 years ago it would be worth over $500,000 today. [Using the Bitcoin time machine you can compare to some other investments as well.](https://imgur.com/a/RqkNwtU)

However past results do not always guarantee future results and the question often asked is ""How big can the crypto market cap get?"" If you are pessimistic you might think it cannot grow much further. So how to profit off crypto?

One method is to use the various forms of passive income that the crypto space offers.  

There are several ways to earn passive income through cryptocurrencies and here are some of the most common ones:


**Yield farming**: Yield farming is a way to earn interest on your cryptocurrency holdings by lending them out to other users on a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. The interest rate varies depending on the platform and the cryptocurrency you lend, but yield farming can be a lucrative way to earn passive income. It's worth learning about impermanence loss as this is not a risk free way of earning money. 

**Masternodes**: Masternodes are servers that support the blockchain network and provide additional functions, such as instant transactions, privacy features, and decentralized governance. By running a masternode, you can earn rewards in the form of cryptocurrency. However they normally take a large amount of capital to set up. If you had a lot of money already you might want to find a safer form of investing. 

**Dividends** : 
Some cryptocurrencies offer dividends to their holders. Dividends are typically paid out as a percentage of the network's transaction fees or revenue. Examples of cryptocurrencies that offer dividends include NEO, Vechain, and Kucoin. Not much to say about this, similar to dividend investing on the stock market.

   **Staking**: Staking involves holding a certain amount of cryptocurrencies in a wallet or exchange to support the network's security and transaction verification. By doing this, you can earn rewards in the form of more coins. Staking can be done with several cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Cardano, and Polkadot. Staking can be tricky and you should be aware that when the price of the original coin goes down you can still be losing money while staking. Also there are some coins with insane APR's and they generally turn out to be scams. 


**Airdrops**: Airdrops are free distributions of cryptocurrencies to holders of a particular token or coin. Airdrops are typically used to promote a new cryptocurrency or reward existing holders. I'll add faucets under this heading as well. In the early days of bitcoin people were literally giving away whole coins!

**Crypto mining**: Mining involves using computational power to solve complex mathematical problems that verify transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain. By mining cryptocurrencies, you can earn rewards in the form of more coins. Depending on your set up though you might end up spending more money on power then you earn in crypto. Also takes some capital to start as well.

382,Good development teams of cryptocurrencies projects should NOT be visionaires.,11taohy,"Greetings from Portugal.

Crypto companies have been hiring a lot of employees to diversify their businesses and make the best of the opportunity during bull market. That's also the reason we saw a lot of job cuts during bear market and increased pressure from investors.

Cryptocurrency development requires a deep understanding of technical details. **While visionaries may have great ideas for how the technology could be used, they may not have the technical expertise to actually develop a functional cryptocurrency.**

And trying to have a multi ideia team would increase costs and elevate the dificult of execution. This could ultimately lead to a stagnant project that fails to meet the needs of its users.

383,Why I think it may be safer and more worthwhile to put your crypro in exchange sometimes.,11taao9,"Firstly, When I want to withdraw my crypto, the exchange I used asked for app password, hardware authenticator, and phone otp. Then sent a email to me. And before that you need to create withdrawal white list for the account you are sending to.
While I heard of people losing tens of thousand easily when people access their seed phase to their wallet.
And I won't lose access to my crypto on exchange  like I would when I lost my seed phase of my non custodian wallet. As my exchange account is tied to my identity, my email, my hardware authenticator and phone number beside the password.
I could also earn a decent interest rate with the cryto exchange earn program.
So do you agree that if we could find 
reputable and good exchanges, it would be relatively more efficient and safer to put 50% of our cryto investment into the exchange? Or why not?

384,How concerned are you with recent SEC's take on Proof of Stake?,11t9tf8,"By now, you all are aware of SEC aka Uncle Gary's ""recommendation"" to treat all Proof-of-Stake chains as Securities. This can trigger a lot of unnecessary poking into various projects. Unfortunately, every major chain except Bitcoin is PoS so the scale of this disruption is non-trivial.

The optimistic side of me wants to believe that all SEC/Gary wants is to create better policy/ regulatory framework for these blockchains so that bad actors can't mess up with investors (especially Retail investors) but if history were a reference, none of us like the case of Ripple/ XRP -  once a shiny toy of Crypto world, now dragging its feet in the dust with SEC.

It's less about the downside risk of project success, it's more the unfortunate dragging year after year that kills the interest in dev community and momentum. A lot of these major chains are still very early (except Ethereum, maybe) so an SEC intervention/ poking can really hurt them.

Time will tell what happens next but I don't have a good feeling about where it's headed. Probably there is something to be done by these Blockchains to not add any fuel to Gary's fire but I think it would take two to tango and SEC needs to act believing that retail investors do want these projects to succeed, not at the risk of being scammed, but by taking measured risks and methodology to innovate and grow.

On a separate note, this will place more trust and confidence in Bitcoin and smart contracts built on it so probably that's blessing in disguise, or may be even a bull flag for BTC pending some macro relief/ stimulus.

This will cause further liquidity issues at banks, yet shows exactly how irresponsible banks are due to their fraction reserve philosophy, which should be criminal, in that it is lending out money they do not have.  Yet, somehow since its banks and they can’t fail, its allowed?

The exact reasoning they are trying to limit withdraws for crypto related activity is because crypto such as bitcoin is a competitor to what banks are.  Storing your money.  When bitcoin, in a digital wallet, in your pocket is just as good if not better due to future valuations.  

By setting limitations, banks are proving exactly why bitcoin was created in the first place.  Everyone deserves financial independence and banks locking your money in their control should just speed up adoption, even though they are trying to accomplish the exact opposite.

Saying it now, buy as much as you can now while you are still able too before further limitations come into effect.  It’s obvious banks and governments are terrified of crypto with recent events.  They will stop at nothing to retain absolute control.

Right now its limits, next week its a complete block temporarily to “stabilize financial markets and trust”, and next month it will be entirely locked out of on ramping through banks.

I see them as the first follower of the crazy lone dancer at a festival who starts a movement, as explained in this [YouTube video about leadership lessons from dancing guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ). In this analogy, Robinhood is the crazy dancing guy because no serious investor trusts them.

According to the video, a leader needs the courage to stand alone and look ridiculous, but what they're doing should be simple enough to follow. That's where the first follower comes in with a crucial role: publicly showing everyone how to follow. The leader embraces the first follower as an equal, and it becomes about them as a group. It takes guts to be the first follower, as you stand out and risk ridicule yourself. However, being a first follower is an under-appreciated form of leadership because the first follower transforms a lone nut into a leader. The second follower is a turning point because it proves the first follower has done well. Now it's not just a lone nut or two, it's a crowd, and that's when a movement becomes public.

In the case of crypto trading, we're now seeing the start of an actual movement, just in time for the next halving bull run. More and more people are jumping in, and as they do, it becomes less risky to join. Those who were on the fence before have no reason not to join now. Eventually, those who prefer to be part of the crowd will join, so they won't be ridiculed for not doing so.

In summary, Fidelity is the first follower in the crypto trading movement, and we're seeing the start of a larger movement as more people join in, especially with all the banking woes happening currently.",techsupport261,11,6,0.75

But however, the year 2022 was the year of the Stabelcoins boom as over $15B of stablecoins were added that year alone to the exchanges, with the peak being $45B worth of stablecoins on exchanges alone. The peak of it being just before the FTX collapse in November 2022.

It is true that stablecoins will always be a part of Crypto and especially they are needed in DeFi, I was also once on an other opinion but realised that this is much more true.

People are terribly terrified and scary with the negative mindset, there is a guy with top comments who claim that total crypto marketcap is not likely to be reached in the next bull.

Is it that difficult to understand that crypto market cap needs to go higher than 3TR and BTC going to 100K to have the purchasing power that previous ATH meant at that time?

TLTR: crypto prices need to go significantly higher than previous ATH to offer you the same purchasing power that it did at the last time ATH.  100K would be the new 69K BTC.

403,A physical wallet is NOT the same thing as a cold wallet. A physical wallet will not mitigate your losses from scams and user errors.,11t4r7g,"**Hardware wallets have limited protection**

One thing in common among all the whale attacks mentioned recently in this sub is that none of them used a **cold wallet**. By keeping all their funds in a single active wallet, they lost everything at once.

A few of them used **hardware wallets**, but they still lost all their crypto. Even with a hardware wallet. You can still lose everything by:

* Getting scammed
* Interacting with a bad website
* Signing a bad transaction
* Setting unlimited approval, followed by a dApp hack.

These all user errors, and no hardware wallet will protect you from that. But if you kept the majority of your crypto in cold wallets, your damage would've been severely limited by the smaller amount kept in the hot wallet. The only thing a cold wallet will not protect against is if your whole computer or phone is compromised by malware.

**Follow the best security practices of good Centralized Exchanges (like Coinbase, not FTX): Their cold wallets only interact with their hot wallets.**

**There is a huge misconception that cold wallets and hardware wallets are the same thing. They're not!**

Cold wallets often use hardware wallets and gain even more protection with them. But hardware wallets can also be used to protect hot wallets. 

**If you want full protection, you need to have BOTH a hardware wallet and a cold wallet.**

A lot of media and hardware wallet sites (\*cough\* Ledger) have tried to dilute definitions by misleading customers into thinking that hardware wallets are the same thing as cold wallets. But legit sources like the Ethereum website, Metamask, Consensys, and Alchemy will never say this.

**Origin of the terms**

""Hot"" and ""Cold"" originate from hot and cold storage in IT Security. Hot storage is actively used. Cold storage is for archival data, kept elsewhere, and **not used except for backup recoveries.** You make backup tapes from hot storage, and then transfer them to a cold storage location like Iron Mountain.

A proper cold wallet uses the security principles from cold storage. Send funds from your hot wallet to the cold wallet. Only use the cold wallet if you need to take out some funds for use, and only send to the hot wallet. And whenever you use the cold wallet, double-check the transfer address and make sure you're using a malware-free computer or phone.

**The proper definitions from the UC Berkeley cryptocurrency course**:

* **Hot**: Any wallet you actively use. If you transfer to other accounts not owned by you or interacts with dApps, it's a hot wallet, even if you store the physical 
* **Cold**: A wallet that's used to hold the majority of your funds
* **Software wallet**: Seed is stored in a software client, encrypted by your password
* **Physical wallet**: Seed is stored in a physical device and air-gapped from the software client. Requires a software client.",FluffayPenguin,59,27,0.8
404,Defitaxes.us -- a website to do your defi taxes for free.,11t4047,"https://defitaxes.us

This is a website I made to help process your blockchain taxes. I posted this in r/CryptoTax before. I've been working on this cumulatively for about a year and a half now; at this point this is the best available tool to do your defi taxes (other tools are better for CEX). It is 100% free, and supports up to 50K transactions/wallet (10K on Solana).

It will NOT automatically process everything for you. It will try to make reasonable guesses about what kind of transactions you performed, and will also give you an estimate of how certain it is. It WILL occasionally be wrong. Your input is required to correctly classify many of your transactions, and there are tools to do it in a reasonable amount of time even if you have thousands of transactions (extremely ballpark estimate: 1 hour of work per 300 transactions or so, once you familiarize yourself with the available tools).

Centralized exchanges are supported via CSV uploads, you'll need to convert exchange history to my CSV format (same as cryptotaxcalculator's format). There are kits for coinbase, binance, bittrex, kraken, kucoin to help you convert.

&nbsp; 


Most important features:

1) Support for 29 blockchains -- including Ethereum, Solana, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Fantom. Basically everything  Etherscan team made scanners for + all Blockscout-based scanners + Solana, straight off the RPC.

2) Counterparty recognition -- I page-scraped Etherscan&co label clouds for counterparty names (and also Solscan). What this means is in many cases I can guess who you are transacting with, which will help you identify the transactions. No competitor has this.

3) Custom types -- this to my mind is the killer feature here. If you repetitively made the same kind of transaction many times, this allows you to apply the correct tax treatment to all of them at once. For example, if you claimed reward from some shitcoin.finance a hundred times, you need exactly three clicks to apply the right tax treatment to all of those rewards: click on one of those transactions, click on ""select transactions with the same operation & counterparty"", and click on provided ""Claim reward"" custom type. No competitor has this.

4) Rebase & discrepancy detection -- my site will query debank for your balances and compare it to what it calculated. If there's a mismatch, that means it's a rebasing token. I believe only Koinly has something similar.

5) Intuitive UI -- every transaction is color-coded by how certain I am of processing it correctly.

6) It's completely free, and will stay that way until it gets some traction. Then I am planning to charge a tiny percentage of your assets.  
    
    
&nbsp; 


Biggest deficiencies -- at the moment:

1) Lack of protocol-specific support.

2) No way to import data from the other tax tools.

3) US-specific. People from other countries used it too though.
    
    
&nbsp; 


I am neck-deep in DeFi myself and this was a labor of love to make a website that can actually be used to do your taxes (I tried several competitors and found them all lacking). I've done my own taxes using it for two years now, and I've processed defi taxes for other people using it. I have several thousand transactions across a bunch of blockchains.   

Let me know what bugs and problems you encounter! And I also need help with it, let me know if interested!

1) I need a promotion guy (or gal). Someone with twitter following who can hawk this thing :) So eventually it can be a real business.

2) A second programmer to work on, basically, deficiency #1 -- churn out protocol support code so that most of our users' transactions get correctly auto-classified. There are hundreds of protocols. I just can't do it alone. Code's in python.

3) A token-maker? Maybe? I dunno.",Xirax,18,4,0.67

My strategy is to stop DCAing into a coin as soon as it becomes a profit bag and start accumulating Fiat for future dips or bear markets. I think that during this time I have accumulated enough coins to start accumulating Fiat to also buy things in real life like a new gaming computer.

This chart analysis from an analyst on Twitter shows how we perfectly bounced off the Weekly Moving Average 20 (blue) and now even regained the Daily Moving Average 50 (green) which has been a crucial support during our previous rally.

Also we regained crucial support horizontal areas of $22k, then the $23.9k support and now are looking to hold pretty solid support at $24k+. 

All of the current drop was also pretty expectable as we could clearly see how BTC was struggling at the $25k mark and now the banking crisis gave a good reason for a deep flush out of longs and now of shorts too. Because remember that all markets want to do is to equally liquidate longs and shorts. The runaway may now be “clearer“ for BTC to take off.",partymsl,24,7,0.68
410,How people earn money with Crypto,11t2kdv,"Hello guys.

I already saw many people here which asked how other people earn money with Crypto. Long story short. There are several ways to make money in Crypto Space.  
 

**First**: Trading (dex, cex, wallets)   
This is the most common way to get money. As long as people respect the rules :D Buy low! Sell high! (I know most of us use the other rule: by high, sell low)  
   
**Second**: mining (wallet, special software)   
Above all, this requires good hardware and a lot of investment... In my opinion, mining is not for newcomers... But OGs still make good profits!  
 

**Third**: Staking (dex, cex, wallets, project websites)   
As staking becomes more and more popular, good money can be made from it. In my opinion, one of the greatest things about staking is that you get paid with the coin/token you stake. Let's do an example of why I love staking! Cardano. Started in 2017. We all know what happened after the 2017-2018 bull run. All coins went to hell!   
Also ada went from 2018 ATH ($1.10) to 2020 ATL ($0.03).   
   
Here's the trick of staking. If you (some people I know have) bought 33k ADA for $1000 priced at $0.03. You invested $1000 at an APY of 0.05% = $50 per year (or 1.6k ADA).  
 

Now that's $0.3. That means first. Your $1,000 investment is worth $9.9k. In addition, your rewards have also increased in value. You still get 1.6k ada per year. But these Ada aren't worth $50 anymore, they're worth $480 a year. That means your APY of your initial investment is now almost 50%! (Whoever was smart and sold their Ada at ATH could do much better. But we're just looking at staking here)   
   
There are several other coins that have gone the same way.  
 

Note: Different coins and tokens use different types of staking. Some coins/tokens you need to send somewhere when staking. For other coins, you can keep the coins in your wallet and stake them in the safest way!

**Fourth**: Lending (On dex, cex) When borrowing, 10% APY is common. Again, you get the rewards in the coin/token you borrow. Sometimes other coins too.  
 

**Fifth**: Providing Liquidity Mining (on Dex and Project websites) You need a pair of tokens for this. You provide the liquidity on dexes that people use for their switches. Depending on how many people are providing liquidity, the APY can start above 1000% (rare for good coins) and something between 10% and 40% APY is normal.  
 

This APY seems to be quite high. But beware! The permanent loss could destroy your income! When your coin pair increases steadily. You can withdraw as many coins as you originally provided. But if a coin is more successful. You get less of the winning coin and more of the other coin. Here's a great example I have: SAND/ETH (no longer available) If you've bought SAND for less than $0.05 in the past... you've provided liquidity to SAND/ETH. Sand performed much better than ETH. In this case, you received less SAND when you closed the pair, but a lot more ETH. In the end the price in $ would be higher if you only have the SAND left. BUT while providing liquidity you also earned some SAND to sell. And getting more ETH is allways good!  
 

Liquid mining is perhaps the most complicated thing. But in my opinion it is a great way to earn passive income. As said, inform yourself about theimpermanent loss.  
 

**Sixth**: NFT flipping (project websites, NFT trading websites)   
This is almost the same as trading coins/tokens. You see, there are many ways to make money. In my opinion, trading is only good for experienced people. I prefer the passive income route. Like staking, lending and liquidity mining!

411,whats your favorite wallet app and why?,11t2emb,"Since a few days ago with all the banks closing and shit, I tried to find out which wallet app is the best out there. I wanted to ask you guys instead of google as i believe this sub to be a better source of information on that topic. What is the best one in your opinion?

I hear alot of people talking good about metamask and trustwallet. But are there any newer wallets out there that i should try? I mostly hoard bitcoin as i believe its the goat and will be for awhile so i dont really need to trade much. Im looking for security and an easy to use interface.

I would also use this post to say that the metamask logo looks dope

Netflix Explained: Cryptocurrency (2018)

For anyone who just wants a quick tour of the world of digital assets without going into details for hours, the 14-minute-long documentary Netflix Explained: Cryptocurrency is a perfect choice. It offers a brief explanation of the concept of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology – ideal for beginners in the crypto space.

Crypto (2019)

Popular among the mainstream audience, Crypto is a crime thriller starring Kurt Russell, Beau Knapp, and Alexis Bledel. The story follows a young Wall Street banker who gets caught in the web of fraud and money laundering involving cryptocurrencies and provides an authentic demonstration of the technology at work.

Netflix’s edge-of-seat crime documentary Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King traces the mysterious death of Gerald Cotten, the founder of Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX. The multimillionaire supposedly died in 2018, upon which it was revealed that C$250 million of investors’ money was missing or inaccessible because only Cotten had the password to cold wallets.

Cryptopia: Bitcoin, Blockchains, and the Future of the Internet (2020)

Anyways, on their official Telegram channel, customer service is asking me to provide my secret 12 phrase answer for my account. 

I have *NOT* (repeat - NOT) provided them anything. They are saying they need this to buy me my coins and deposit them directly into my account. 

Question is - Is this legit because obviously I am warned not to share my secret phrase with anyone. 

Thanks.

Edit: Thanks everyone. Maybe I should have added this: They asked me if I have installed Trust Wallet, I had not, then they asked me for the phrase password. At this point, even though my wallet is completely empty, they can hack into it later on and drain my account once I have some coins. Please explain if this is also correct.

Honestly just sounds like they want to ignore a majority of buyers in the uk in general rather than work around any of the problems associated with crypto.

416,"Bitcoin is about to have its 3rd green monthly-candle and has already achieved the highest 3-month gain since January 2021. Also, after each third green monthly-candle there has ALWAYS been a fourth.",11t15k2,"I think after 2022 and the bitter-cold bear market we had, it is high-time that we also lay back and enjoy once we got a small victory and that time is now. We should not really spend all of our time debating whether this is just a “bear market rally“ or an actual reversal. Let‘s just look at some hopium-filled stats:

[Picture and observation by BTC\_archive on Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/arhfgjcq25oa1.jpg?width=1199&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=170681a31e630989a2e09b559862dfb5c2908dee)

One of them is looking at our monthly candle chart. Here we can see how we are just on the brink of having a 3rd consecutive green month. Obviously half of the month is still left but a close above $23.1k would guarantee it, which seem very likely currently.

Another very interesting fact is that if you just take ANY three consecutive green candles, you will realize that there has never been ‘just‘ three green months but always at least four green months.

This one here shows the 3-month candle which is barely used but can be a good indication for a rough trend overview. Here we are about to have our best 3-month candle since January 2021, the very beginning of the last bull market, which had a massive 100% gain in three months.

I hope I was able to give you all some cool stats on the way (and of course some optimistic hopium). Let‘s enjoy the positive effects for a bit and not just debate.",partymsl,254,422,0.82

418,Don't Let Hackers Drain Your Crypto Wallets: Simple Security Tips to Keep Your Funds Safe,11t0wcb,"I decided to create this post because of the earlier post where a comrade was hacked and lost over $300K because of breaking some basic crypto security rules.

First of all, if you are reading this, I am sorry for your loss and I hope life or FBI returns you this loss in one way or another.

Now I am going to list some easy tips that I am not going to get tired of repeating:

* Enable app based 2FA like Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
* NEVER store seed phrases or Recovery keys for 2FA in whatever device that can be connected online. ALWAYS store it offline like in two paper notebooks.
* Use passwords managers like Bitwarden Open Source Password Manager.
* NEVER share your seed phrase.
* Use Brave browser which includes an integrated AdBlock to avoid Google Ads phishing sites.
* Always verify that the software are you downloading comes from the original website.
* Don't trust SMS or Emails, always check things from the original website.
* Control your greed. Greed is the principal reason that leads people to make mistakes and fall into scammers.

I just found a picture from CryptoPotato that explains some basics too in a cool way.

419,"Storing Your Seed Phrase (give me a better idea, I beg)",11t0j05,"Obviously, there are a lot of opinions on how to store your seed phrase. It’s a general fact that taking a screenshot or keeping it in a file (probably named “seed phrase”) is a a bad idea, because a lot of software scans for that type of stuff. 

Some people write down their seed phrase on paper. Nice and secure right? Old school, no one can hack it. But then if you loose it or there’s a fire, there goes your crypto. To solve that, I actually have it written down and stored on two separate pieces of paper in two different houses. But even then, people say it decays over time, I’ve heard stories of the ink running and blurring to the point it was unreadable and their crypto was lost. 

Some have a better idea. Carve it into a slab of metal. Fire proof, water proof, generally wear and tear proof. Good luck destroying that. But not gonna lie that sounds expensive and where do I even go for that? 

I’ve come up with an idea that I’m not sure is great at all, but beyond carving it into a block of literal metal idk what else there is. What about an unmarked file (password protected) that contains a paragraph or long-ass sentence. You memorise that every x words makes up your seed phrase, so to anyone else it just looks like junk and there’s no way to know it’s a seed OR the combo. 

Anyway yeah just rambling, if that’s a bad idea tell me now before I do it lol",Nonchalant_Calypso,216,25,0.75
420,Noob question about cold storage,11t0bda,"I've looked into it and I still have some questions about cold storage/cold wallets.

They're considered the safest way to store your crypto, private key. But let's say you buy a Ledger device and let's say in 20 years ledger isn't a thing more and you can get another one, you lost your ledger or its been damaged is your crypto no lost forever?  It's not like you can buy a trezor and enter in your seed phrase right?

If someone found your seed phrase do they need a ledger to gain access to your crypto or can they access it somewhere way.

I'm just wondering if people buy a device and that device is no longer sold or goes out of business are you screwed again this is probably a dumb noob question. 

Are trezor and ledger the best options or are there other cold storage choices. I don't have enough coins to need a cold storage but just future planning thanks for the help.",Randompersonxxxx,26,5,0.78

422,Vault access issue desktop vs. mobile,11t0255,"Not sure if anyone has heard of this problem or not but I'll share my dilemma. I'll preface this by saying that I've done a fair amount of digging around in old posts to see if there are similar issues but nothing 100% definitive. 

First of all I only use Reddit on desktop, never mobile and in fact I had never even installed the app on my phone before. I received a couple of those custom avatars (like the NFL one) and claimed it but directly via the desktop app since that's all I use. After reading several posts here about setting up your vault for moons, I decided I should probably do that (not that I'm flush with moons). So I download the mobile app and sign in and when I go to the Vault it says that one already exists under my username and it asks for a password and/or a recovery phrase but the problem is, I never set one up. Like, never. I'm accustomed to using recovery phrases and quite seriously store those securely, so if I were to set up a recovery phrase, I would have it. From what I found in past posts it seems like the only place I could have set up a vault would have been on mobile, but since I never even had the mobile app installed, then how can one exist?

Could this be a bug? Is it possible that by accepting custom avatar via desktop a vault was created but because desktop isn't yet designed to create the vault password & recovery phrase the user never sees that option? I could be wrong but I think my only current choice might be to overwrite the vault and lose any current moons I have? (I'm less concerned about the avatar)",misterjoego,25,4,0.83
