The repository for the term project has been created. Several files have been added to the repository, such as LICENSE.md, project_plan.md,
progress_report.md, README.md, and .gitignore. I have figured out which subreddits I would like to collect posts from, which are several
subreddits dedicated to various cities in the United States. I have registered my project with the Reddit API so that I can use the Reddit
API for my project.
