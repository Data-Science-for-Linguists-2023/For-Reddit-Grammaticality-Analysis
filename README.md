## Project Overview

This repository analyzes the grammaticality of posts on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). Specifically this repistory seeks to answer the main question: 
Is there a way to categorize common grammatical errors? 

Within that question, several subquestions are developed:

Which grammatical errors are most prevalant on Reddit?

Are there grammatical errors that are more common across certain subreddits?

Does the grammaticality of a post have an effect on its interactions?

## Data Overview

All of the data that I used for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2023/For-Reddit-Grammaticality-Analysis/tree/main/data_samples). I collected all of this data myself using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
