# Reddit: An Analysis on the Grammaticality of Posts

## BRIEF SUMMARY
Reddit, along with other social media websites and applications, has dramatically altered the way in which communication occurs. 
Communication online no longer requires complete, grammatical sentences to properly convey a message. What I hope to is explore is the commonality
of the incomplete and ungrammatical sentences, in comparison to complete and grammatical sentences on the website, and the most common errors 
found within these incomplete and ungrammatical sentences.

## DATA
The data that I will work with comes in the form of Reddit posts, from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). These posts will be collected using
the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/), which is very compatible with Python. I plan on taking posts from several subreddits of various 
cities across the United States, such as [r/pittsburgh](https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/), [r/chicago](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/), 
and [r/losangeles](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/). I am not sure what data size I will be aiming for, however there are a significant amount
of posts to work with. There will definitely be data cleaning involved, as these posts contain a lot of information that I will not need, such as 
images, URLs, and various other things. There also may be some level of annotating these posts and certain aspects of their structure and elements.

## ANALYSIS
The end goal is to analyze the grammaticality of Reddit posts. This would include finding the amount of ungrammatical posts and ungrammatical 
sentences, and comparing them in a ratio with grammatical posts and grammatical sentences. This would also include categorizing various issues
in posts, such as missing a pronoun or punctuation. It would also be fun and interesting to compare different subreddits to see if one subreddit
has more ungrammatical posts or if certain grammatical errors are more common in a certain subreddit. It would also be interesting to see if
the ungrammaticality of a post has any impact on the amount of upvotes and downvotes on the post. I do not have any hypothesis I will be testing.
If there is time, I would like to do some type of predictive analysis.

## PRESENTATION
The presentation will contain an overview of relevant background information, displaying various posts that were used during the project,
the various stages of the project, and a lot of graphs to visualize results.
